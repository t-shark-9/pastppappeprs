Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.   A water authority supplies water to its customers. The amount of water supplied to each
     customer is measured by a meter. There are two types of meter; an old meter and a new meter.

     The water authority also provides sewage services. This is when waste water is returned
     from the customers’ houses to a central processing plant. Only the new meter is able to
     estimate the amount of waste water returned.

     The authority reads the meters annually and the charges for these services are sent to the
     customers.

     The annual charges to customers are calculated using a model that takes into account the
     following variables:

     METER_TYPE         The type of meter which can be either old or new.

     WATER_IN           The reading displayed on both meters (the reading is a 6-digit display in
                        litres) which is used to measure the volume of water supplied.

     WATER_OUT          The reading displayed on the new meter only (the reading gives a
                        6-digit integer display in litres) which is used in estimating the volume of
                        waste water returned to the sewage system.

     INFRA_CHARGE       The cost of maintaining the infrastructure for supplying water and
                        providing the sewage service. This is an annual charge of $204.80.
                        This amount is reduced by 10 % if a new meter is used.

     (a)   Identify the possible range of values and their data type for each of the above variables. [3]

     The digital displays on each meter function as follows:
     • The digital display on each meter increments by one every time a litre of water passes.
     • If the display reaches its maximum value it resets to 0 and then continues to function as
       before.

     (b)   Outline how the yearly supply of water is calculated.                                      [2]

     The rules for calculating the annual bill for each household are as follows:
     • The price for each litre of water supplied is $1.90.
     • The total annual bill is the sum of the charge for the water supplied and the infrastructure
       charge.
     • If the household has a new meter and at least 95 % of the water supplied is returned to the
       sewage system, then the infrastructure charge for that household is reduced by 10 %.

     (c)   Construct the pseudocode that will calculate the annual bill for a household based on
           the information given above. You should introduce any new variables where necessary.       [7]

     (d)   Identify three possible measures that customers could take to reduce their
           infrastructure charge.                                                                     [3]

5.   The average weekly consumption for a family of four is 2700 litres of water. This includes the
     water needed for domestic cleaning, personal hygiene, cooking and drinking.

     An online software tool is available to help families calculate how much water they are using
     for regular activities that require the supply of water. The software tool includes a model
     which estimates the water usage. A simulation can be run using this model.

     (a)   With reference to the scenario described above, explain the difference between a
           model and a simulation.                                                                      [4]

     The data given below estimates the amount of water (in litres) needed for different household
     activities:

                                  Activity                          Litres

                                  Dishwasher, full load               15

                                  Washing machine, full load          60

                                  Bath                                70

                                  Shower                              35

                                  Toilet flush                         9

     (b)   Explain how the choice of data in the table may affect the quality of the simulation.        [4]

     By using the data shown above, a family uses a spreadsheet to run some simulations of how
     to distribute the use of water.

     (c)   Outline how a simulation in a spreadsheet can be organized so that the family can
           ensure a consumption of no more than 2700 litres per week.                                   [5]

     The same spreadsheet is used by a group of four young people who share a house. The
     simulation, however, does not reflect their actual situation and the weekly target is often
     exceeded.

     (d)   Identify two reasons why the simulation may not reflect the actual situation in this case.  [2]

6.   Medical students require extensive training in preparation before they qualify as a surgeon.
     Part of this training involves the use of simulation software.

     (a)   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of training medical students with
           simulation software.                                                                     [4]

     The simulation software projects the surgery scenario onto a touchscreen display. Students
     wear “smart” gloves to hold tools for performing the virtual operation on the touchscreen
     monitor. The touchscreen display shows realistic surgical tools.

     (b)   Identify three technical aspects that the gloves have to address so that they can be
           used in this way for the simulation of operations.                                       [3]

     (c)   Define the term visualization.                                                           [2]

     The medical school is considering updating its simulation software, which currently displays
     the simulation in 2D, to one that displays it in 3D.

     (d)   Discuss whether this change to a 3D display would improve the quality of the training.   [6]

Option C — Web science

7.   The online edition of a newspaper includes a collection of audio podcasts. These podcasts
     are interviews with artists and scientists and last for up to 10 minutes. They may have been
     provided by other broadcasters and agencies.

     (a)   Identify two actions relating to the source of these podcasts that should be taken by
           the newspaper before publishing them.                                                      [2]

     At any time, no more than eight podcasts are available on the online edition of the
     newspaper.

     (b)   Outline one technical reason for restricting the number of podcasts to eight.              [2]

     The podcasts can either be downloaded or streamed.

     (c)   State one format for an audio file.                                                        [1]

     The podcast can be stored online using either lossy or lossless compression.

     (d)   Compare these two approaches for a person who downloads or streams these
           podcasts.                                                                                  [5]

     A person is streaming one of these podcasts at home. However, he is experiencing buffering
     problems, where the podcast keeps stopping and starting.

     (e)   Outline one reason for this problem.                                                       [2]

     These podcasts are normally displayed on the website in the chronological order in which
     they were added, with the most recent on top. However, users who regularly access the site
     for science podcasts, may see them presented in a different order, with all the scientific ones
     on top.

     (f)   With reference to the technology involved, explain how this is made possible.              [4]

     (a)   Describe how this URL provides security in communication over the Internet.           [2]

     A person enters the URL for BesTea into their browser.

     (b)   Identify the steps that the Domain Name System (DNS) server will take in order to
           locate the correct IP address for this request from the browser.                      [4]

     The logos of the credit and debit cards accepted by BesTea are displayed as images in the
     footer of all of its web pages.

     (c)   Outline how the footer of a web page can be made identical across all pages of a
           website.                                                                              [2]

     The BesTea website includes a shopping basket facility that enables users to make
     purchases.

     The following fragment of PHP code is present in the script that allows users to place a
     completed order:

     <?php
       …
     $_SESSION['sessionUserID'] = new_random_number();
     $query = $db -> query ("SELECT * FROM users_db WHERE id = "
     .$_SESSION['sessionUserID']);
     $userRecord = $query -> fetch_record();
     …
     >

     (d)   Suggest the function of this fragment of code.                                        [4]

     Users may perform several actions on their shopping baskets. These actions require
     interaction with a central database of products. Each record in this database includes the
     identifier, the name and the price of one of these products.

     Consider the following fragment of code:

     <
     $basket = new Basket
       …

     If $_REQUEST['action'] == 'removeBasketItem' && !empty($_REQUEST['id']){
     remove($basket, $_REQUEST['id']);
     header("view_basket.php");
     }
     >

     (e)   From the code, identify the information that the user has provided.                   [2]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

An airport uses an object-oriented program to keep track of arrivals and departures of planes.
There are many objects in this system and some are listed below.

    Flight                Each Flight has many attributes including a unique ID code.

                          In addition to a variable of the type Flight, each Arrival has a
                          Scheduled Time of Arrival (STA) in 24-hour format, a runway number,
    Arrival
                          a gate code, a delay time (in minutes) and an indicator whether the
                          airplane has landed.
    FlightManagement      The main class that manages the arrival and departure of all flights.

The code below outlines the Arrival class used in this program.
public class Flight
{ private String id;
  public String getId() {return this.id;}
  // ... more variables, accessor and mutator methods
}
public class Arrival
{ private Flight myFlight;
  private String sta;      // Scheduled Time of Arrival ("hh:mm")
  private int runway;
  private String gate;
  private int delay;
  private boolean landed;
 public Arrival(Flight myFlight, String sta)
 { this.myFlight = myFlight;
		this.sta = sta;
		this.runway = 0;
		this.gate = null;
		this.delay = 0;
		this.landed = false;
 }
     public void addDelay(int newDelay)
     { this.delay = newDelay;
     }
 public String getETA()
 { // calculates the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) of the flight
		 // by adding the delay to the sta and returning the result as a
		 // String ("hh:mm")
 }
 public int compareWith(String flightID)
 { if (myFlight.getID().equals(flightID)) { return 0; }
		else { return 1; }
 }
     public int compareWith(Arrival anotherArrival)
     { // missing code
     }
     // ... plus accessor and mutator methods
}

      The code below outlines part of the FlightManagement class used in this program.

      For the purposes of this exam only arriving flights are being considered.

      public class FlightManagement
      {
        private Arrival[] inbound;                        // array of inbound airplanes
        private int last = -1;                            // index of last used entry

            public FlightManagement()
            { inbound = new Arrival[200];
            }

       public void add(Arrival newArrival)
       { // missing code that adds the newArrival to the array inbound
      		 // sorted by ETA, and updates last

            private int search (String flightID)
            { // missing code that searches the array inbound and
              // returns the index of the Arrival object with flightID
            }

       public Arrival remove(String flightID)
       { Arrival result;

(Option D, question 10 continued)

      The method search in the FlightManagement class searches the array inbound and
      returns the index of the Arrival object with the given flightID.

      (d)   Construct the method search() implementing a linear search. Use the first
            compareWith() method in the Arrival object.

            You may assume that an Arrival object with the given flightID exists in the array
            inbound.                                                                              [4]

      (e)   (i)    Outline one advantage of using a binary search.                                [2]

            (ii)   Outline one disadvantage of using a binary search.                             [2]


11.   (a)   Outline the use of data-hiding as a security feature in OOP.                          [2]

      (b)   (i)    The Arrival object has two methods named compareWith.

                   Outline why calling the compareWith method does not cause a conflict.          [2]

            (ii)   State the name of this OOP property.                                           [1]

      The method compareWith(Arrival anotherArrival) compares the Estimated Time of
      Arrival (ETA) of the current Arrival object with the ETA of another Arrival object. The
      method should return a negative value if the current Arrival object’s ETA is less than the
      ETA of anotherArrival.

      Remember that the String class contains a method compareTo() as follows:
      given two String variables A and B,
      A.compareTo(B) < 0 when A is lexicographically smaller than B
      A.compareTo(B) = 0 when A is equal to B
      A.compareTo(B) > 0 when A is lexicographically bigger than B.

      (c)   Construct the code for this method compareWith().                                     [3]

12.   (a)   Define the term method signature.                                                    [2]

      The array inbound in the FlightManagement class is sorted by Estimated Time of Arrival
      (ETA).

      (b)   Construct a method showDelayed() that outputs the IDs of all delayed flights in the
            array inbound that have not yet landed and that have an ETA before a given time t.
            The time t is passed as a String parameter.                                          [4]

      (c)   Without using a sorting algorithm, construct the method add(Arrival newArrival)
            that inserts a newArrival in the sorted array inbound. You may assume that
            newArrival has been instantiated and that the array inbound is not full.             [6]

      When a flight is delayed, a method in FlightManagement is used to find and update the
      flight with the delay and to reorganize the array so that it remains sorted for the ETA.

      (d)   Describe how this method would be implemented using the methods provided.            [4]
