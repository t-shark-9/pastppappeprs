Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools
of thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic
illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Examine the relation between one school of thought and one of the following theoretical
     perspectives in the work of one anthropologist:
      a structure-centred perspective
      a diachronic perspective
      a particularist perspective.


2.   Discuss the use of one of the following theoretical perspectives in relation to the study of one
     contemporary social issue:
      a materialist perspective
      a conflict-centred perspective
      an agency-centred perspective.


3.   Compare and contrast two schools of thought in relation to either a universalistic perspective or
     an idealist perspective.


4.   Discuss the strengths and limitations of taking a synchronic approach to ethnography.


5.   To what extent does a cohesion-centred perspective contribute to an understanding of the
     social and cultural world?
