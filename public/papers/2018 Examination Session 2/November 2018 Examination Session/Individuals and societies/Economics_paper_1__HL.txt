Microeconomics

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Using the concept of the multiplier, explain how an increase in investment might affect
           aggregate demand.                                                                         [10]

     (b)   Discuss the effectiveness of supply-side policies in reducing unemployment.               [15]


4.   (a)   Explain the potential effects on the economic growth rate from a substantial increase
           in the number of skilled people of working age entering a country.                        [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that, apart from indicating economic growth rates over time, national
           income statistics are of little use.                                                      [15]
