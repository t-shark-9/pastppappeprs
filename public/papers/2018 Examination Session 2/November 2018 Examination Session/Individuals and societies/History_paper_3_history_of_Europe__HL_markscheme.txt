Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   Discuss the changes that occurred in English government and administration as a result of the
     Norman invasion.

     This question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of governmental
     and administrative changes that occurred after the Norman invasion of England. They may argue
     that the changes were profound, limited, or perhaps that the extent varied in different fields.
     Changes themselves may be addressed chronologically, thematically, or in terms of their perceived
     importance. These changes may include the introduction of feudalism, with candidates noting the
     attempts to increase royal authority and exert control over the populace via methods such as castle
     building. When gauging the extent of change, candidates may address the transfer of land to the
     barons who formed the feudal aristocracy. However, some candidates may note that at lower
     levels there was limited land transfer and that the population remained largely Anglo-Saxon with
     limited French immigration. Reference may also be made to the harrying of the north and its
     long-term impact. Some candidates may argue, that in several areas, changes were limited at best.
     In terms of the structure of the state, candidates may argue that the counties remained an
     administrative unit and that the position of the Church—both within the state and as a
     landholder—was unchanged.


2.   Evaluate the methods used by Henry II to restore royal power at the beginning of his reign.

     This question requires that candidates make an appraisal of how successful Henry II was in
     reasserting royal authority in England. They will consider strategies used to bring the barons and
     earls under control and reference may be made to the demolition of unlicensed castles, as well as
     the building of new royal castles and the appointment of sheriffs. Candidates may argue that
     Henry’s judicial reforms reduced baronial influence and his justiciars extended his control over law
     and order. The Assize of Clarendon emphasized the importance of the King’s justices, again
     reducing baronial influence. Henry’s attempts to restore territorial control were not wholly
     successful: he forced the Scots to retreat and, to some extent, brought Ireland under control;
     however, he was less successful in Wales. Henry was also unable to reduce the independence of
     the Church. Candidates may argue that Henry was most successful in bringing the Barons under
     control and restoring the royal finances.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   “Economic ambition was the most significant reason for Christian opposition to the Muslim states in
     Spain.” Discuss.

     This question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that Christian opposition to Muslim states in Spain was mainly driven by economic ambition. While
     it is likely that most candidates may focus largely, or entirely, on the economic ambitions of the
     Christian powers, some candidates may also argue that the Christian response was a reaction to
     the economic achievements of the Muslim states. Candidates may fully or partially agree with the
     statement or they may argue that other factors were more significant. Nevertheless, the key issue
     of the question—economic ambition—must be fully addressed and may include factors such as the
     increasing pursuit of the tribute in frontier lands and the repartimiento of Muslim lands. Factors
     other than economic ambition may include the focus on religious identity (which provided
     opportunities for cooperation between the Christian kingdoms and stimulated the reimagining of
     political unity) and the decline of the Muslim states, particularly Al-Andalus, which experienced
     political disunity over time.


4.   “Religious hysteria during the Crusades was the most significant reason for the persecution of the
     Jews.” Discuss.

     This question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the most significant reason for the persecution of the Jews during the Crusades was religious
     hysteria. Candidates may argue that the attempts to Christianize the Muslim lands on the
     peripheries of Europe spilled into efforts to purge Christianity of elements within Europe that were
     perceived to be undesirable and that the Jews were one such group. However, pre-existing
     anti-Semitism may be held to be more accountable and inferences of this may be seen in the
     popular response to official dogma from Rome, legal restrictions by various rulers that limited the
     occupation and livelihood of Jews, formal expulsions from certain territories and the belief in
     Jewish culpability for the Black Death.
                                                   –7–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Discuss the reasons for the re-emergence of the Hundred Years War in 1415.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
     the Hundred Years War re-emerged in 1415. These reasons may be addressed chronologically,
     thematically, or there may be an attempt to offer a discussion of significant factors. Candidates
     may argue that Henry V was a new and confident king with expansionary aims and a desire for
     political victory. It may also be suggested that French disunity presented a suitable opportunity for
     Henry V to mount a campaign when he did. In addition, or alternatively, candidates may argue that
     two of the original causes of the Hundred Years War—the status of the duchy of Aquitaine and the
     English claim to the French crown—were still unresolved. Other factors that may be mentioned
     include several English nobles’ desire to recover lost French territories in France, and the early
     military victories over the French at Agincourt and Normandy that sparked English enthusiasm to
     wage war.


6.   To what extent did the War of the Public Weal challenge royal authority in France?

     The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which royal authority in France was
     challenged by the War of the Public Weal. Candidates may argue that the war was or was not a
     significant challenge, or that other contemporary challenges to royal authority were more
     significant. While this latter approach is acceptable, the focus of the response must be on the War
     of the Public Weal and its impact on royal authority with the other factors used to provide context.
     When addressing the challenge posed by the war itself, candidates may refer to the initial
     opposition (by a coalition of French feudal lords) to Louis XI’s efforts to centralize royal authority.
     Due to this initial response, Louis was forced to grant concessions to the feudal lords, which left a
     legacy of internal conflicts between various factions. These conflicts evolved into civil war and
     divided royal authority in France. Some candidates may argue that, ultimately, the war’s impact on
     royal authority was limited; the king’s rivals were disunited and were defeated by royal forces, and
     royal authority was expanded into all areas of government.
                                                  –8–                   N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Evaluate the significance of political writings to cultural and intellectual development during the
     Renaissance.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of political writings to
     cultural and intellectual development that occurred during the Renaissance. Candidates may begin
     by briefly contextualizing the period in which the political writings developed and how they
     challenged the existing establishment. They may argue that the political writings of the time helped
     develop new ways of political organization and authority. Candidates may explore how the political
     writings of Machiavelli challenged the moral basis for rulers and instructed them to only worry
     about the maintenance of power. Candidates may also look at the impact of contemporary secular
     humanist ideas contained in the political writings and make an appraisal as to the impact on rulers.


8.   Compare and contrast the forms of government in Milan and Venice.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the forms of government in Milan and Venice, referring to both city states throughout. Candidates
     may address the question systematically, addressing similarities and then differences, or
     thematically, identifying areas that shared some features but differed in others. In terms of
     similarities, both city states contained an oligarchy in the form of a strong nobility, and both had
     republican forms of governments (albeit temporarily in the case of Milan). However, while Venice
     had a great council and senate that challenged the (elected) Doge’s power, in Milan periods of
     monarchical rule dominated. Another difference was that Venice contained constitutional
     mechanisms and legislative procedures that Milan did not. There does not need to be an equal
     weighting of comparisons and contrasts.
                                                  –9–                  N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    “Patronage was the main reason for Portuguese exploration of the west coast of Africa.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that patronage was the main reason for Portugal’s exploration of the west coast of Africa. They
      may agree or disagree with the statement. In their responses, candidates may argue that without
      the ambition, and subsequent, patronage of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese exploration of
      the west coast of Africa would not have taken place. However, candidates may argue that the
      rationale behind this patronage was Henry’s desire to forge trade links with Africa and thus suggest
      that economic motives were more important. Other factors that may be addressed include a desire
      to convert Africans to Christianity, the developments in ship building, cartography and navigation
      that facilitated such exploration as well as the power of trade and mercantilism that, given the
      geographic proximity of Portugal to the west coast of Africa, made exploration more likely.


10.   Discuss the economic impact on Europe of the exploration of the Indian Ocean.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic
      impact that the exploration of the Indian Ocean had on Europe. Candidates may argue that a range
      of expensive goods, such as gold, ivory, porcelain, and silk, transformed European markets and
      fuelled further competition in Europe. They may argue that the exploration of the Indian Ocean
      stimulated further collaboration between business and government, one of the outcomes of which
      was the emergence of the Dutch bourgeoisie. The development of new financial instruments, for
      example joint stock companies and stock exchanges, can be viewed as having a central economic
      impact. Other factors that may be explored are the importance of other raw materials such as
      cotton, food and tea and their relationship to the social and market transformations that were taking
      place.
                                                   – 10 –               N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6: The Reformation (1517–1572)

11.   Evaluate the state of the Catholic Church at the start of the 16th century.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the state of the Catholic Church at the
      start of the 16th century. Candidates may argue that the basic religious assumptions that had
      upheld the Church for hundreds of years were beginning to be challenged. Corruption within the
      Catholic Church was a major cause of criticism and there had, for some time, been serious
      criticisms of the clerical hierarchy and the quality of religious guidance that was provided for lay
      people. While there were attempts at reform within the Church (reference could be made to
      humanists such as Erasmus), reformers such as Luther, would ultimately criticize it from outside
      the confines of the Catholic Church. Political rulers were also renouncing their allegiance to Rome.
      Alternatively, candidates may argue that the criticisms of the Church were exaggerated and that,
      for many people, the day-to-day operations of the Church were not a pressing concern. Others
      may argue that the state of the Catholic Church at the start of the 16th century was little changed
      and that any process of reform was slow.


12.   Evaluate the impact of the Jesuits on the Catholic Reformation between 1540 and 1572.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact that the Jesuits had on the
      Catholic Reformation from their formation until 1572. Candidates may argue that the Jesuits
      introduced a new ideology, mixing military discipline and a strict vow of obedience to the doctrine
      of the Catholic Church. They may also explore the impact of their educational philosophy that was
      humanist and theological and was meant to capture the Renaissance and resist the ideas of the
      Protestant Reformation. Candidates may also explore the Jesuits’ success in terms of the scale of
      their membership and the number of houses and colleges that they had across Europe and the
      impact that their adherents had in challenging non-Catholic practices in several European states.
      Candidates may wish to contextualize the role of the Jesuits by evaluating their impact in light of
      other Catholic reforms, for example the spiritual movements and the wider impact of papal reforms
      such as the convening of the Council of Trent.
                                                  – 11 –               N18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Examine the influence of the Scientific Revolution on the development of Enlightenment ideas.

      This question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Scientific
      Revolution and the development of Enlightenment ideas, identifying the factors that helped propel
      thinkers from a medieval mindset into a new Age of Reason. Some of the factors that may be
      mentioned are the concepts of inductive and deductive reasoning; scientific thought and methods
      being applied to non-scientific topics; free thinking, which brought political modernization to the
      West, in terms of introducing democratic values and institutions; and the popularization of the
      sciences. Several approaches may be adopted. However, candidates must provide clear links
      between the Scientific Revolution on the development of Enlightenment ideas to demonstrate its
      influence.


14.   Evaluate the extent of social and economic changes that took place during the Enlightenment.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the extent of social and economic
      changes that took place during the Enlightenment. Candidates will identify a range of social and
      economic changes and gauge the significance of their impact. Examples could include the focus
      on reason over superstition, the Radical Enlightenment which promoted the concept of separating
      Church and State, Adam Smith’s free trade principle. Some candidates may argue that change
      was, in some cases, relatively limited, for example in terms of the minimal changes to the social
      structure of most European states. Enlightenment ideas tended to be confined to relatively small
      groups in society. Candidates may suggest that economic change could be considered to include
      the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon (1774–1815)

15.   Evaluate the impact of Robespierre on the French Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Robespierre’s impact on events in
      France during the revolution period. There may be some reference to his membership of the
      Estates General and how tensions there led to the outbreak of revolution. However, the focus will
      be on events after July 1789, following which it may be argued that Robespierre’s main impact was
      to radicalize the revolution. Here, candidates may refer to his demands for the execution of Louis
      XVI, the encouragement of violence against Girondins, the demands for a republic and his
      encouragement of the Reign of Terror in Paris and the provinces. A counter argument may be that
      the response to Robespierre’s extreme and violent methods was a desire for a moderate republic
      and the Thermidorean Reaction was a direct consequence of Robespierre’s domination of the
      revolution.


16.   Evaluate the impact of Napoleon I’s foreign policies on France.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the consequences for France, of
      Napoleon’s expansionist foreign policies. There may be consideration of the economic, social and
      political impact of his policies. Social impact may include the consequences of conscription and
      high casualties, and the alienation of some groups because of the imprisonment of the Pope.
      Economic impact may include high taxation and the dislocation of trade because of the Continental
      System. It may also be argued that one of the main consequences was the coalition’s invasions of
      France from 1813 and the imposition of a financial indemnity. Some candidates, citing the various
      conspiracies against him and ultimately his abdication and the Bourbon restoration, may also
      argue that Napoleon’s concentration on foreign policies destabilized the state. It may even be
      suggested that, despite his early success, Napoleon’s foreign policies were, overall, detrimental to
      France.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   “The Revolution of 1830 was caused by discontent with Charles X, not enthusiasm for Louis
      Philippe.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Louis Philippe came to the throne as a reaction to the bad government of Charles X.
      Candidates will consider the extent of discontent with Charles X, perhaps arguing that he was a
      reactionary. In support of this statement, they may cite the increased influence of the Church
      (especially the Ultramontanes), the St Cloud Ordinances and the appointment of Polignac. They
      may suggest that all this led to increasing opposition and the likelihood of revolution. Others may
      argue that Louis Philippe had the support of the middle classes and note that he had actively
      opposed the reactionary policies of Charles. For middle class politicians, such as Thiers, Charles’s
      refusal to compromise meant that Louis Philippe was the obvious replacement. Although Louis had
      limited popular support, he was regarded as a better option than a republic.


18.   “Stability was the main domestic benefit of the Second Empire.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the most significant domestic benefit of the Second Empire was that it brought stability to
      France. In support of the statement, candidates may refer to the lack of open opposition to the
      regime until the late 1860s. Candidates may also argue that, even at that point, the promise of
      liberalization reduced opposition (perhaps noting the 1870 plebiscite in support of this). The extent
      of support for the Second Empire, especially in conservative rural areas might also be cited as
      evidence of stability. Some candidates may mention the strong centralized administrative structure
      that maintained stability. Others may argue that the political stability was superficial, as opposition
      was unable to function because of the authoritarian nature of the empire and that there was
      significant working class opposition to the empire, especially in Paris and northern France. The
      working classes did not benefit from the economic prosperity of the period and their discontent
      became obvious following France’s military defeat in the war against Prussia, during which the
      empire was easily overthrown.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Compare and contrast the impact of the 1832 and 1867 Reform Acts.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in impact
      that the two Reform Acts had on Britain and Ireland. They may focus on any number of effects, for
      example the impact on political parties, the size of the franchise and/or any consequential effects.
      Similarities may include increasing the size of the electorate, and the retention of an
      income-based franchise qualification. Both acts failed to redistribute constituencies to reflect
      population density and both acts failed to reduce the influence of landowners in rural areas.
      Contrasts may include comments on the nature of the electorate following the Acts. After 1832,
      the electorate remained largely middle class, with both agricultural and urban workers remaining
      disenfranchised, whereas post-1867, some of the male urban working class gained the vote. The
      1867 Act reduced the use of influence in elections because of the increased size of the electorate
      in urban areas. Arguably, the 1867 Act was a much greater extension of democracy ("a leap in the
      dark") than the Great Reform Act of 1832.


20.   Evaluate the impact of Gladstone’s domestic policies (excluding the Irish Question).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Gladstone’s major
      policies within Britain throughout his various ministries. However, candidates may not refer to the
      Irish Question in their responses unless it is to provide context for the relative importance and/or
      success of the domestic policies. Some candidates may approach the question in terms of what
      Gladstone wished to achieve compared to what he achieved, be that in terms of equality of
      opportunity, or economic and efficient government. Other candidates may approach the question in
      terms of the impact on Gladstone and the Liberal Party. Major legislation referenced may include
      Forster’s Education Act (1870), the various army reforms of the ministries, the University Tests Act
      and civil service reform (both 1871), the Judicature Act (1872), which made the administration of
      justice more efficient, and the Reform Act (1884) and the Redistribution of Seats Act (1885), the
      latter two being concerned with equality and efficiency. For those candidates considering the
      impact on the Liberal Party, areas for evaluation may include the Criminal Law Amendment Act
      (1871) and the Licensing Act (1872), both of which aroused opposition within the working classes.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   Evaluate the impact of the Congress of Vienna on Italy up to 1849.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the 1814–5 Congress of
      Vienna and its ensuing treaty on Italy. Some candidates may argue that the immediate impact on
      Italy was somewhat reactionary: rulers overthrown by Napoleon were swiftly restored as was
      Austrian influence—both directly and indirectly—in the central duchies and northern Italy
      (Lombardy and Venetia). Other candidates may argue that the impact of the Congress was to
      invigorate the nationalist societies and the sense of Italian national identity that had emerged under
      French rule. Conversely, it may be argued that many of the disturbances in Italy in the 1820s,
      1830s and in 1848/1849 were due to economic problems or demands for constitutional reform;
      rather than the desire for Italian unity and the overthrow of the Vienna settlement. The enlargement
      of Piedmont (Sardinia, Nice and Savoy) arguably enabled Piedmont to challenge Austrian
      domination of northern Italy and was an unforeseen consequence.


22.   Discuss the causes of the 1848–1849 Revolutions in Germany and the reasons for the failure of
      those revolutions.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered review of the reasons why there were
      Revolutions in 1848 and 1849 in Germany and why they failed. The reasons varied from state to
      state, ranging from peasant unrest in the country, to artisan unrest in the cities and among the
      middle classes. There was also discontent with the remnants of feudalism and frustration regarding
      royal scandals, for example the elevation of the Irish stage performer “Lola Montez” to Countess of
      Landsfeld. Candidates may also consider the role of German nationalism in causing the
      revolutions. Regarding the issue of failure, reasons were also varied. While, in some cases, there
      was some element of political reform (the Frankfurt Parliament) or the granting of moderate
      constitutions, there was a lack of unity as to the type of constitution desired or the extent of
      German unity that was desired. Further, there was no clear leadership, a factor that reflected the
      differing causes of the revolutions.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union
            (1855–1924)

23.   Discuss the causes and consequences of the 1905 Revolution in Russia.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes and
      consequences of the 1905 Revolution. For causes, candidates may focus on a range of long-term
      causes, such as liberal frustration with autocratic rule. This led to the growth of revolutionary
      parties, or economic problems. Other long-term issues included the poor working conditions in
      many parts of Russia and the land hunger that prevented landless peasants from improving their
      situation. Other candidates may emphasize short-term and immediate causes, for example
      Russia’s defeat in the Russo–Japanese War and Bloody Sunday both of which highlighted
      government incompetence. When discussing consequences, candidates may again differentiate
      between short- and long-term effects. In the short-term, there was some apparent reform (the
      October Manifesto and the establishment of the State Duma). When considering the long-term,
      candidates may argue that Russia began the process of reform under Stolypin because of the
      1905 Revolution or that the 1905 Revolution highlighted the weakness of the monarchy and that it
      was a dress rehearsal for 1917.


24.   “Lenin had the most significant role in the consolidation of the new Soviet state.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Lenin played the most important role in ensuring the survival of the Soviet state. Many
      candidates will agree with the statement, citing Lenin’s importance as leader of the party, in
      implementing policies that would gain popular support, and in dealing with potential opposition.
      Reference may be made to Decrees on Peace and Land, War Communism, and the New
      Economic Policy (NEP) and their importance in maintaining Soviet power. Other candidates may
      argue that, while he was significant politically, Lenin would not have been able to deal effectively
      with the threats to the new state such as the civil war and the uprisings against War Communism
      (Kronstadt) alone, and that Lenin needed the effective military leadership of Trotsky to consolidate
      Soviet power. Some may argue that Lenin and Trotsky were equally important and that they
      complemented one another.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   Evaluate the importance of the long- and short-term causes of the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the short- and long-term reasons for
      the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. Candidates may separate the causes into two distinct
      groups (long-term and short-term). However, it is expected that candidates identify that causes did
      not work in isolation and that they were interconnected. Long-term causes that may be mentioned
      include rising militarism, the Alliance System, imperialism, and aggressive nationalism in the major
      powers and other territories in Europe such as the Balkans. Short-term causes may include the
      assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the July Crisis and the failure of diplomacy. Other short-term
      causes could include the impact of war plans, such as the Schlieffen Plan, widening the conflict.


26.   To what extent did US entry into the First World War contribute to Allied victory?

      The question requires that candidates consider how far the entry of the US into the First World War
      contributed to the Allied victory. They may identify a range of factors that support the view that US
      entry was a major factor in Allied victory. Some may propose an alternative thesis and argue that
      other factors were more important, for example the overwhelming strength in numbers of the Allied
      forces, especially following the entry of Italian forces in 1915 and the impact of British Imperial and
      dominion forces. Economic factors, including the blockade, the failed war economy in Germany,
      the weakness of German allies and the domestic instability within the Central Powers, may also be
      considered. Nevertheless, the bulk of the response must deal with the significance or otherwise of
      US entry into the war.

Section 14: European states in the inter-war years (1918–1939)

27.   Discuss the reasons for the rise to power of Mussolini.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      Mussolini’s rise. Candidates may argue that Mussolini was a product of the First World War and
      the sense of a mutilated victory. Candidates may identify the context of intensified nationalism,
      combined with Mussolini’s political programme as a reason, or they may argue that political
      instability (frequent changes in government and fear of socialist revolution - Bienno Rosso).
      Economic problems, including unemployment and inflation, could be argued to have facilitated his
      rise. Other factors that may be considered include Victor Emmanuel III’s decision to appoint
      Mussolini prime minister in 1922, fearing the March on Rome. He had the support of the Church
      and the PPI.


28.   Evaluate social developments in one European country (other than Germany, Italy or Spain) in the
      inter-war years.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of social developments of one European
      country in the inter-war years, although they must not choose Germany, Italy or Spain, as these
      countries are specifically excluded in the History Guide. Candidates may argue that the inter-war
      period brought about significant social divisions in the country of their choosing and explore how
      the lives of citizens were affected by changes in, for example, education and religion. They may
      also gauge the extent and impact of changes in the health sector or the arts. An additional or
      alternative route may be to appraise developments in terms of their impact on the role of women
      and/or minority groups. Developments may be considered positive, negative or a mixture of both.

Section 15: Versailles to Berlin: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   Discuss the reasons for, and the results of, the policy of appeasement.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      and results of the policy of appeasement. Candidates may set the context by discussing the
      weaknesses of the League of Nations and failure of collective security. Other reasons may include
      the democratic nature of the British and French governments, which could not be seen by their
      voters to be preparing for war. Britain and France were reluctant to finance any military build-up
      after the challenges of the Great Depression, and Hitler was sometimes perceived as a bulwark
      against Soviet Communism. For some in Britain, there was also a belief that the Treaty of
      Versailles had been too harsh. Results of the policy may include Hitler’s successful foreign policy
      up until March 1939, the disillusionment of Stalin with the Western powers and the signing of the
      Nazi–Soviet Pact (August 1939). Some candidates may argue that appeasement made Hitler more
      confident in pursuing his goals. Candidates may also argue that appeasement contributed to the
      outbreak of war in September 1939 because Hitler was not stopped earlier. Some candidates may
      also argue that appeasement bought time for Britain and France to prepare for war.


30.   “The Second World War had a devastating impact on the civilian population.” Discuss with
      reference to any two European countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact that
      the Second World War had on the civilian populations of any two European countries between
      1939 and 1945. Specific details and content will depend upon the two countries chosen.
      Candidates may adopt a comparative approach if they wish, but this is not a requirement of the
      question. Some of the issues that may be considered include the fact that it was a war in which
      more civilians died than soldiers; where there was food rationing and food shortages, where
      civilians suffered from air raids that caused major destruction and led to many casualties. Impact
      may also encompass the methods by which the governments of the chosen countries controlled
      economic activity and the ways in which this control affected the daily lives of civilians. Some
      candidates may argue that there was a noticeable change in the role of women in society and
      there was a growing sense of national unity and support for the governments’ war efforts.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   Discuss political and economic developments in the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1953.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of political and
      economic developments in the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1953. Candidates may address the
      question chronologically or thematically, dealing with politics and the economy, where appropriate,
      separately. There may be some imbalance between political and economic developments;
      however, both aspects must be a feature of the response. Policies discussed may include the Five-
      Year Plan, atomic arms development, the Doctor’s Plot, the Leningrad Affair and post-war
      reconstruction. There was economic recovery in terms of industrial production, but agriculture
      remained underproductive and was severely affected by theories such as Lysenkoism. Some
      candidates may conclude that there was little change politically, as Stalin remained unchallenged
      in power, and that the political atmosphere was similar to the period of the purges.


32.   “By 1991, Gorbachev’s policies had achieved his aims.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that, by
      1991, Gorbachev’s policies had achieved what they had intended to achieve. Candidates may
      approach the question in terms of identifying a range of strengths and weaknesses in Gorbachev’s
      policies and they may conclude that none, some or all his policies fully realized his aims. They may
      note that Gorbachev faced several challenges and that these may have limited his achievements.
      Policies addressed may include glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). Gorbachev’s
      policies were aimed at reforming politics and modernizing the economy. Some candidates may
      argue that other figures such as Yeltsin pushed for greater change leading to opposition from
      conservatives in the party, and thus increasing popular discontent with the party. Attempts at
      economic reform led to inflation, shortages of basic goods and an increased budget deficit. The
      problems led to increasing support for radicals and the loss of support for Gorbachev and his
      resignation in December 1991. Any reference to Soviet foreign policy should be linked to
      Gorbachev's aims.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   Evaluate the role of Adenauer in Germany’s economic recovery.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of Adenauer in Germany’s
      economic recovery. Responses will gauge Adenauer’s contribution to Germany’s post-war
      recovery and consider other contributory factors, for example, the importance of Marshall Aid and
      its funding of the rebuilding of Germany’s industrial infrastructure. The work of Erhard (minister of
      economic affairs) may also be considered. Adenauer presided over the establishment of a sound
      democratic system: one that facilitated a strong economic recovery, paved the way for good
      relations with France and the US, and thus the West, secured Germany’s position in the Western
      Alliance and its admittance to NATO and the European Economic Community.


34.   Examine the role of Juan Carlos in Spain’s peaceful transition to democracy.

      The question requires that candidates consider the role of Juan Carlos in Spain’s peaceful
      transition to democracy. Candidates may suggest that his role was significant or not and they may
      address other factors to contextualize Juan Carlos’s role. However, the bulk of the response will be
      on Juan Carlos. Some of the factors that may be reviewed are the King’s liberal and democratic
      principles following his accession to the throne, his encouragement of the revival of political parties
      and an amnesty for political prisoners. His appointment of reformist prime minister Adolfo Suárez
      was significant. In 1981, Juan Carlos took swift action to defeat a military coup that threatened to
      topple Spain’s nascent democracy. The consequent weakening of the military sector preserved
      democracy and made the formation of a socialist government possible in late 1982.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Discuss the political and economic measures undertaken by the Soviet Union to dominate central
      and eastern Europe between 1945 and 1955.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of how the Soviet
      Union took control of central and eastern Europe following the Second World War, up to 1955.
      While there does not need to be equal coverage of political and economic factors, both must be
      addressed. The political factors to be considered may include the methods by which governments
      were installed and how trade relations developed. Related issues may include the extent to which
      national parties were controlled by Moscow, the Soviet response to any sign of independence and
      the establishment of COMINFORM. Economic issues may encompass the impact of COMECON
      and the way industry in the satellite states was linked to the economic needs of the Soviet Union.
      The impact of the signing of the Warsaw Pact may also be considered.


36.   Discuss the reasons for, and the results of, the uprising in Czechoslovakia (1968).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the uprising in
      Czechoslovakia in 1968. Reasons for the uprising may focus on the desire for more control over
      internal policy, more economic freedom to trade with the West and fewer restrictions on civil
      liberties. Dubcek’s attempts at reform (socialism with a human face) were halted by the invasion of
      Warsaw Pact forces in August 1968. In the short term, Dubcek was replaced by Husak, Moscow
      continued to dominate Czech politics and reformers were persecuted. Long-term results of the
      uprising may include the issuing of Charter 77 and greater pressure for independence that
      developed in Czechoslovakia after 1985, once Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union.
