                                        Section A

1.   (a)   Describe two elements of a marketing plan (line 21) for AFA.                          [4]

           The main elements of a marketing plan are:
            details of the marketing objectives of the business including target market
            sales forecasts
            marketing budget including financial projections
            marketing strategies (which may include 4Ps at SL, 7Ps at HL)
            detailed action plan

           Context:
            Sam has poor understanding of finance, so the budget may not have been
             done well.
            He may have had problems with forecasts as this is a new business.
            One objective was to only sell coffee.
            Sam had CSR as one of the objectives, which, presumably applied to
             marketing.

           The two elements can both come from the 4Ps provided they are clearly
           distinguished.

           Do not allow elements from a business plan, eg vision statement, unless they are
           clearly linked to marketing.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each correct element identified and [1] for a description of how that
           feature relates to AFA. Award a maximum of [2] per element.

     (b)   With reference to AFA, explain why applying appropriate principles and ethics of
           accounting practice is important.                                                     [6]

           Accounting principles and ethics include:
            integrity – being straightforward, honest and truthful
            objectivity – avoiding bias, conflict of interest
            professionalism – accounts produced to relevant professional standards
            confidentiality
            accounts need to comply with legal obligations and be compliant with
             standards set by professional bodies.

           Context: in the context of AFA the business is run on ethical and fair trade
           concepts. Failing in any of the accounting principles and ethics could damage the
           reputation of the business and AFA could lose sales and customers. Investors
           will also need reassurance in relation to the ethics of the business. Other
           stakeholders, such as pressure groups concerned with fair trade, may need to be
           satisfied.

           Discussion of ethics in a wider sense is allowed but [6] can only be achieved if
           there is some reference to accounting principles.
           If ethics are general, and no mention of accounting principles/ethics then
           maximum award is [3].
           If accounting principles only with no reference to ethics/accounting ethics then
           maximum award is [3].

Be aware that context is difficult, so the same context can be used for the various
different principles/ethics.

Accept any other relevant explanation.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

2.   (a)   Describe two external stakeholders of AFA, other than customers.                        [4]

           External stakeholders include:
            customers (not allowable for this question)
            suppliers – originally nervous about supplying Sam’s new business. Need to
             conform to fair trade principles. Could include mystery shopper if it is clear that
             this is not an employee
            government – for taxes, data etc. Includes a Companies House role for proper
             accounts. Could include trading standards for ethics. Could include licensing
             issues. No evidence as to whether government wants to encourage fair trade
             or not.
            banks and other creditors – at times AFA needs finance for expansion
            special interest groups/pressure groups, eg charities, NGOs, pressure groups
             – there is a fair trade movement (no need to use terms like special interest
             groups)
            the community – little evidence in case so not a good one to choose to get
             context mark
            competitors – supermarkets also stock fair trade products.
            possible external sources of finance.

           N.B.: Shareholders are NOT external.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each correct element identified and [1] for a description of how that
           feature relates to AFA. Award a maximum of [2] per element.

     (b)   With reference to AFA, explain the importance of branding.                              [6]

           The importance of branding to AFA can be classified in a number of areas:
            competition: branding can be used to differentiate eg from supermarkets.
            USP: AFA seeks to be the only dedicated fair trade store. Branding can
             enhance this USP
            pricing: A well-developed brand can help AFA set premium prices, helping
             profits which need improving.

           The importance can be developed through:
            the need to attract customers (eg, to the new stores)
            the need to encourage repeat purchases, eg through brand loyalty.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, often a pre-prepared textbook
           answer

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
                                                   –8–                 N18/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   With reference to AFA, outline one benefit and one cost to Sam of opening a
           new e-commerce website (lines 51–52).                                                [4]

           Main context: Sam’s vision to operate at a global level. Management issues.
           Need to reduce costs.

           Benefits include:
            targeting new customers locally, nationally and even globally, which is Sam’s
             vision
            sales volumes will increase, revenue will grow and – assuming costs are kept
             under control – AFA’s profits will increase
            economies of scale, eg with suppliers.
            possible reduced operating costs eg fewer sales assistants, lower rents
             without retails outlets.

           Costs include:
            designing the website
            managing the website, maintenance costs
            managing orders – paying packers etc
            dealing with increased sales (eg, recruiting people, paying additional wages,
             more warehousing etc)
            other setup costs, eg for online payment systems
            diseconomies of scale (Sam and Finn are not managing well).
            opportunity cost – if developed.

           N.B. Costs do not include general disadvantages

           Mark as 2 (benefits) + 2 (costs)

           Award [1] for each correct cost or benefit identified and [1] for a description of
           how that cost or benefit relates to AFA. Award a maximum of [2] per cost or
           benefit. There can be no more than one of each (cost or benefit).

     (b)   Distinguish between the leadership styles of Sam and Finn.                           [6]

           N.B.: Culture is not on the SL guide.

           Sam:
            Sam clearly wishes to remain in charge of AFA as a paternalistic or (soft)
             autocratic leader.
            Allow laissez faire and other leadership styles if explained effectively.
            There is evidence from the stimulus that Sam prefers to be a “big picture”
             thinker.
            He is mostly involved in the setting of the mission and vision of AFA.
            He does not enjoy the day-to-day running of the business and has left this to
             Finn.
            However, there is also evidence that Sam, given his positive thoughts towards
             Daniel Pink’s theory, is a “soft” autocrat, given that he is willing to delegate
             and empower some of the managers to run their own individual retail stores.
            Some candidates might mention that, using Handy’s classification from the
             Gods of Management, Sam is clearly a Zeus figure. – there is no need to
             mention these.
                                      –9–                 N18/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Finn:
 Finn clearly aligns his leadership to a more structured or bureaucratic style.
 He seemingly enjoys monitoring the details, which Sam finds boring.
 Finn enjoys centralization and control, which is tied to the way in which he
   communicates.
 Finn clearly believes in formal organization and his leadership style typifies
   this.
 His decision to employ a mystery shopper to effectively spy on his managers
   indicates that he is slightly paranoid and wishes to know about everything
   occurring in the business.
 Some candidates might mention that, using Handy’s classification form the
   Gods of Management, Finn is typically showing the leadership style inherent in
   an Apollo figure. There is no need to mention these.

Candidate can be rewarded if they argue that the styles are both the same
(usually autocratic) provided, they support their argument.

Accept any other relevant explanation.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

Award a maximum of [3] if only Sam or Finn.

Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
Eg if both are explained but not distinguished.

                                         Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term intangible asset.                                                         [2]

           An intangible asset is an asset that lacks physical substance and usually is very
           hard to evaluate, but it can add value to the business. It includes patents,
           copyrights, franchises, goodwill, trademarks and brand names with links to
           product positioning of a good or service that a business may offer.

           The definition does not need to be worded exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the
           answer above.

           NOTE: Some candidates may write their definition in the context of AFA; in such
           cases, the main examples of intangible assets would be brand image (due to
           ethical behaviour and CSR leading to competitive advantage, customer loyalty,
           positive word-of-mouth) and goodwill.

     (b)   (i)    Calculate the gross profit margin of AFA for 2016 and 2017.                        [2]

                                 142 888 100
                  GPM 2016 =                 = 6.6 %
                                2 164 486   1

                                 124 211 100
                  GPM 2017 =                 = 5.17 %
                                2 400 625   1

                  Award [1] for each correct answer which includes the % (percentage) sign.

           NOTE: candidates are not asked to show their working. Candidates may round
           up the results of their calculations for example, 5.1% or 5.2% instead of 5.17%.

           (ii)   Explain one possible reason for this trend in gross profit margin for AFA
                  between 2016 and 2017.                                                             [2]

                  Given that sales revenues have increased, the likely cause of the decrease
                  in gross profit margin is that direct costs have risen faster. There is
                  evidence of diseconomies of scale being experienced by AFA and this
                  calculation backs this up.

                  Another possible reason is fluctuation/increase of foreign currency
                  exchange rates (as AFA works with “wholesalers that import products from
                  many parts of the globe”, line 46).

                  Another possible reason is the increase of the cost of goods sold, which
                  could be linked to the fact that price of fair trade goods may
                  fluctuate/increase.

                  Award [1] for a possible reason for the trend in gross profit margin, with an
                  additional mark for application to AFA.
                                             – 11 –              N18/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain one benefit and one cost to AFA of using fringe payments (perks) as a
      way to financially reward staff.                                                    [4]

      Example of explanation of a benefit:
       For AFA, given the low wages, it is likely that fringe payments will act as an
         incentive to existing and new staff. Private health care, for example, would
         allow Sam and AFA to demonstrate a commitment to the well-being of its
         employees in the same spirit that the fair trade movement does for its
         suppliers. Motivation could improve and address some of the issues raised by
         the mystery shopper that Finn employed.

      Example of explanation of a cost:
       The cost to AFA is that even with considerable revenue growth, fringe
         payments will increase direct costs, which will put further pressure on gross
         margins. Sam and Finn would also need to draw up new contracts of work,
         clearly stating how the new fringe benefits would be calculated and
         distributed. There are additional managers who may be attracted to this
         rewards scheme and this may create some jealousy if they are not fairly
         applied. One key question is whether the fringe payments will apply to all
         staff.

      Award [1] for each benefit and cost identified, with an additional [1] per

(d)   Discuss whether Sam should accept the offer of a takeover.                            [10]

      There is considerable evidence from the stimulus that Sam and Finn's
      relationship is on the verge of breaking down. The mystery shopper incident has
      fuelled suspicion on both sides and a lack of trust and cooperation is evident.
      It would appear that Sam does not wish to involve himself in the day-to-day
      running of the business and instead focus on “big picture” thinking. This offer
      from the international retailer coming at this time would be very tempting.
      Entrepreneurs such as Sam sometimes do sell a business looking for new
      opportunities as they may have achieved their own personal goals in setting up a
      new sustainable business. The goodwill offered by the purchaser would easily
      allow Sam to put his entrepreneurial qualities to good use in new markets. There
      is considerable evidence from research that some serial entrepreneurs enjoy
      setting up new enterprises as an exciting challenge and when the final goal is
      achieved move on. Sam does seem to be restless and bored easily and the
      current tensions/conflicts may force his hand.

      However, whilst the positive publicity from the reality television show has lifted
      Sam, it could be easily taken away if the takeover occurs. “Temperton sells out”
      headlines would not help Sam or AFA and could impact on the brand value of the
      business. There is also the hypocrisy from Sam (given that he wanted to help
      internal and external stakeholders in the best way that he could) that the sale of
      AFA would create. Can he afford to tarnish his image?

      Finn and Kip provide the conscientious voice against the sale. AFA is doing well
      and its position in the market is established. There is, however, still much to do.
      Why quit now when the actual goal has not been fully achieved?

      There is conflict at AFA and this is to be expected. It would be a great shame for
      all the hard work carried out if Sam were to accept the offer. However, Sam and
      Finn appear to be drifting apart. Perhaps a change at the top is needed to bring
      fresh thinking to AFA at a time of expansion as long as Kim and Finn remain loyal
      to AFA.
