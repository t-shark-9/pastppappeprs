                               Core theme – patterns and change

                                               Section A
1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Describe three characteristics of this projected population structure.                   [3]

           Any three valid, distinct and descriptive points of the structure for [3].
           Quantification/use of data from the x/horizontal axis must be present for full
           marks.

           Possible characteristics include:
           • ageing or greying population
           • few young dependents
           • small economically active group
           • imbalanced gender ratio in the ageing cohorts
           • youthful gender ratio is more balanced.

           Comments on rates (birth rates falling), trends (old age population growing) or life
           expectancy (females living longer), etc, are explanations as opposed to
           description and should not be credited.

     (b)   (i)    Estimate the difference, in millions, between the projected numbers of
                  males and females in the 75–79 age group.                                         [1]

                  Approximately 0.5 million more females than males [1] (accept 0.4 to 0.6).

           (ii)   Suggest two reasons for the difference estimated in (b)(i).                     [2+2]

                  Answers need to address why females live longer than males – they can be
                  generic or specific to Japan.

                  Award [1] for each valid and distinct reason, and [1] for development
                  and/or exemplification.

                  For example: Men tend to engage in more risky occupations (civilian) [1],
                  eg mining, construction, thereby increasing their mortality rate [1].

                  Other possibilities include:
                  • most armed forces are mainly men / combat increases mortality
                  • high-risk occupations
                  • lifestyle choices (smoking, drinking, diet)
                  • females use preventative health measures –
                    proactive health screenings, counselling and maintenance to prevent
                    future illness and treatment, improved maternal mortality
                  • biological/physiological make-up of men compared to women – eg males
                    have more visceral fat (more dangerous) / females have more
                    subcutaneous fat / more active female immune functioning / the
                    protective effect of estrogen / compensatory effects of the second X
                    chromosome
                  • crime-related factors / high-risk behaviour.

                  It is important that the two factors are distinct and NOT a similar reason
                  developed twice.
                                              –4–                 N18/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Suggest two reasons why governments need population projections.                        [2+2]

      In each case, award [1] for a valid reason, and [1] for further development/detail.

      Possibilities include:
      • ability to estimate future state revenue from taxes / size of future working
        population
      • size of potential armed forces / age and sex ratio of future population
      • allocation of services in the future / eg, elderly care for ageing population,
        nursery provision, housing provision
      • healthcare planning
      • need to apply or modify anti- or pro-natalist policies / if population shrinking or
        growing too large
      • change of migration policies / if economically active population is shrinking
      • need to provide more future employment opportunities.
      • inform business projections due to requirement of various goods and services
        by the population.

2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   Describe the pattern of financial aid flows from New Zealand.                            [3]

           Award [1] each for three valid statements.
           Some quantification is needed for full marks.

           Possibilities include:
           • most is going to islands
           • very little is going to the continent of Asia
           • most goes to Oceania
           • most destinations are south of the equator / least are north of the equator
           • in general, aid reduces from east to west
           • there is some evidence of distance decay.
           • extremes – Solomon Island most / Nauru least

     (b)   Explain three limitations of international aid.                                      [2+2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for basic explanation, with additional [1] for development
           and/or exemplification.

           Aid can be interpreted broadly – allow food, emergency and financial aid.

           Possibilities include:
           • change of donor government may result in a change of policy and aid could be
             stopped thus making it unreliable
           • increases dependency/especially food aid, eg Ethiopia
           • corruption/aid may be utilized by an elite and not filter down to those who
             need it
           • may be tied aid/conditions attached
           • if aid is financial/it could increase the debt burden
           • aid may be too short term/does not have the duration to be effective
           • top-down aid projects/may not target the poorest communities.
           • capital intensive may not provide adequate employment
           • food dumping may cause supply problems for domestic producers
           • aid givers use aid as a means of promoting/protecting their own interests
           • maintenance of aid projects once donor has withdrawn.

     (c)   Suggest one advantage and one disadvantage of using global goals
           (such as the Millennium Development Goals) to help countries develop.                  [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid advantage/disadvantage of the use of goals,
           and an additional [1] for development/exemplification.

           Possibilities include:

           Advantages:
           • Allows for targeted aid – goals can highlight problem areas.
           • Quantifies, which allows for measurement of progress and comparison
             between nations.
           • Global citizenship – some idea of “global goals” and our collective
             responsibility.
           • Time specific – gives a deadline to aim for.
                                   –6–               N18/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Disadvantages:
• They are simply targets – countries are not obliged to follow them.
• Assumes the problems that developing nations face are all the same, can
   over-simplify something more complex.
• A lot of money is wasted on writing reports/media as opposed to being used
   for development projects.
• The goals are designed by the UN and are top-down as opposed to grassroot.
• There is a lack of funding to make some goals a reality.

3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Outline what is meant by the term “environmental sustainability”.                       [2]

           Environmental sustainability means development or utilizing resources in such a
           way as to meet the needs of the present [1] without compromising the ability of
           future generations to meet their own needs [1].

           Accept other valid responses that refer to present day use [1] and future
           continued use by generations [1].

     (b)   Describe the distribution of countries that are using more than 60 % of their
           renewable water resources.                                                              [2]

           Award [1] for each identification of an aspect of the distribution – concentration in
           NE Africa [1] the Middle East [1] and South West Asia [1].
           Allow [1] for description of a common detail (eg “all in northern hemisphere”).

           Award [1] for examples (named countries) that illustrate a correct descriptive
           comment.
           There must be comment on an aspect of the distribution before credit can be
           awarded to examples of countries.


     (c)   Explain one reason why economic water scarcity is relatively common in Sub-
           Saharan Africa.                                                                         [2]

           Award [1] for correct reason and [1] for further development.

           High levels of poverty [1] mean that even though (clean/drinking) water is
           available, it is not accessible (distribution) and/or affordable [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • lack of investment
           • lack of technological development
           • competition for funds between sectors – eg industry and agriculture
           • heavy debt burdens
           • insufficient domestic finance
           • lack of coordination
           • conflict affecting methods of distribution.
                                            –8–                N18/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Explain two ways in which access to safe drinking water can be improved.            [2+2]

      In each case, award [1] for a viable way and [1] for development/exemplification.

      For example: Improved purification methods for public water systems [1] would
      increase the number of residents having access to safe water [1] (as they would
      no longer need to purchase safe water elsewhere).

      Possibilities include:
      • less pollution of the water system – eg sewage or run-off from agriculture or
        industrial pollution
      • desalinization
      • digging wells
      • water transfer schemes
      • sanitation
      • dams
      • household catchment systems
      • increased awareness of consumption rates
      • importing water
      • reduction of consumption associated with a specific activity eg irrigation
      • education.

4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   Estimate the year in which global population peaks.                                    [1]

           2025 (accept 2023 to 2027)

     (b)   Describe the changes in the relative levels of non-renewable resources between
           1900 and 2100.                                                                         [3]

           Award [1] each for up to three valid statements.

           •   stable/slow decline [1] to 1950/70
           •   then drops steeply [1] to 2040/60
           •   after which the level stabilizes again/slow decline [1]
           •   overall decline [1].


     (c)   Briefly explain how this graph shows a neo-Malthusian view.                            [2]

           Award [1] for identification of one characteristic of the neo-Malthusian view and
           [1] for comment on how the graph illustrates the characteristic identified.

           For example:

           Growing populations could outstrip the provision of resources [1] – population
           increases but the provision of food declines before the peak population [1].

           Advocacy of birth control to ensure resource for future populations [1] –
           population reaches a peak and then declines [1].

           Concern with environmental degradation [1] – as population rises so does
           pollution [1].
                                               – 10 –              N18/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Referring to one named resource:

      (i)    describe a strategy aimed at reducing its consumption;                             [2]

             Allow a liberal interpretation of “resource”.

             For example:
             Named resource: Oil.

             Strategy: Substitution of oil power by solar power [1]. Less oil is required
             (oil can be left in the ground) as solar energy is used to heat homes / run
             vehicles [1].

             Award [1] for valid strategy and [1] for further description of its operation.

      (ii)   Explain one strength or one weakness of the strategy as a way of reducing
             consumption of the named resource.                                                 [2]

             Award [1] for valid strength or weakness and [1] for further development
             that links back to a correct identification of a valid resource and a strategy
             to reduce its consumption.

             For example: A weakness is that it is not available in all areas or at all times
             [1], which means that we still need to consume oil in some places or at
             certain times [1].

5.   “The best way to decrease global disparities is to encourage the free movement of
     people across international borders.” Discuss this statement.                                [15]

     The actual and hypothetical migrations that are used to address this question should
     be international in nature. The actual and possible consequences of the movement
     should address whether or not disparities are or could be reduced as a result of this
     movement. A broad interpretation of disparities is possible and can be related to, for
     example: standard of living; human rights; gender rights; access to services.

     Answers are likely to acknowledge that most international migrants move because they
     perceive that their lives will be better in the host nation. This perception will vary
     depending on the nature of the movement, for example refugees from Syria are fleeing
     for reasons of survival whereas a woman from the Philippines may be moving to Hong
     Kong to work as a domestic worker to improve her disposable income.

     Whether or not the migration helps reduce global disparities is debatable and there are
     arguments for and against this.

     Possible arguments for: Some low-income nations have their GNI boosted by
     remittances sent home from migrants working abroad. For example, in Tajikistan this
     amounts to almost 50 % of GNI. These amounts are often greater than ODA (Official
     Development Assistance) and go directly to families on the ground, hence improving
     their standard of living and stimulating development. Migration may provide pathways
     that provide social enlightenment in the home country. Migration also provides diaspora
     networks and improved skills through return migration. The extent to which this reduces
     disparities between nations is questionable though.

     Possible arguments against: Seeing migration as a solution to inequality is very
     complex. Most migrants from low-income countries move into neighbouring nations
     that are also low-income. This is especially the case for forced migrations. Despite
     media reports focusing on Europe, a large number (1 million) of Syrian refugees have
     been forced into Lebanon, a nation that is already struggling to develop. The
     conditions in which some migrants find themselves in the host nation are also far from
     improved, for example Nepalese migrants working on construction sites in Qatar or
     trafficked women. Remittances can take away the incentive for states to invest in
     necessary reforms. Migration of skilled population may have negative economic and
     social consequences for the home country – eg migration of nurses from the
     Philippines.

     Stronger responses may acknowledge that there is no quick-fix solution to reducing
     disparities and that it is highly unlikely in the global climate today that international
     borders are going to become easier to cross – quite the opposite is happening (USA –
     Trump’s attempted travel ban; Brexit). They may argue that there are better ways to
     reduce economic disparities (trade, aid, debt relief, market access) so that international
     migration is not perceived as the only solution.

     At band D, expect responses to describe ways in which migrations could have an
     impact upon disparities.

     For band E, expect either detailed explanation of ways in which global disparities can
     be decreased or some discussion of the effectiveness of free movement as a way of
     decreasing disparities.

     For band F, expect both.

6.   “Global climate change will reduce economic disparities.” Discuss this statement.             [15]

     Responses need to address the actual and potential impacts of climate change.
     These could be negative, such as rising sea levels and more extreme weather events,
     positive, such as increased growing seasons, or unknown, such as possible changing
     rainfall patterns.

     Most responses are likely to disagree with the statement, as it is the developing world
     that is and will bear the brunt of the negative effects of climate change. Low-income
     nations tend to have a large percentage of their populations involved in agriculture and
     are hence dependent on rainfall and growing seasons for their livelihoods and food –
     characteristics that are impacted by extreme events and regional climate change. A
     large number of low-income countries have an element of subsistence agriculture as
     part of their economy. Many of these communities will lack the resilience needed to
     adapt to the vagaries of a changing climate. There are very few developing nations
     that have a geographical location that will benefit from longer growing seasons. Indeed
     many of the low-income countries are in locations that will be adversely impacted by
     climate change. Climate change can to lead to conflict over diminished resources
     which can lead to further impoverishment.

     Climate change can also increase disparities at a national and regional scale. In the USA although
     large areas of the south will suffer economically and socially from heatwaves, storms and failing
     crops parts of New England and the Pacific north-west will do comparatively well, with balmier
     conditions reducing deaths from the winter cold and some crops responding well to warmer
     temperatures.

     Many developing nations will lack the capital to use technological fixes to deal with
     changes such as rising sea levels, extreme weather or reduced/increased rainfall.
     Environmental refugees whose plight has been linked to climate change are mainly
     from low-income nations, eg Somalis to Kenya, Pacific islanders to New Zealand. In
     many cases the burden of hosting these refugees also mainly falls on low-income
     nations. Most of these nations are also not responsible for the anthropogenic
     contributions to the enhanced greenhouse effect.

     Stronger responses may argue that many of the impacts of climate change are still
     unknown, as it is an evolving issue – and so this question is quite difficult to answer.
     They may also argue that the economies of the developed world may be impacted
     upon by climate change, causing an economic slowdown in these regions, which in
     turn which could help reduce disparities between themselves and low-income nations.
     Another approach might be to discuss impacts at different geographic scales. This
     approach may recognize that some regions that are poorer at present may gain from
     improved climate – warmer summers in the UK may encourage tourism in the poorer
     seaside towns of eastern England

     At band D, expect responses to describe how climate change may impact upon global
     disparities.

     For band E, expect detailed explanation of a range of ways in which disparities are
     affected or some discussion of the net impact of climate change on different economic
     disparities.

     For band F, expect both.

7.   “Our climate and Earth’s biodiversity will benefit if we stop using oil as our main energy
     source.” Discuss this statement.                                                             [15]

     Sources of oil are from traditional deposits or new sources such as tar sands and oil
     shale. The major benefit of reducing usage of oil is reduced carbon emissions with its
     implications for future global climate change. These may include changing climate
     belts, extreme weather episodes, increased drought and changing monsoons. Other
     benefits include reduced frequency/severity of pollution events from oil spills, and less
     damage to ecosystems such as tundra, coastal and coral reefs from oil exploration,
     development and tanker/pipeline transport. Some responses may recognize the link
     between climate change and biodiversity – warming/acidifying oceans and pressures
     on coral reefs, warming in UK leading to decline in mountain vegetation, warm water
     species in seas around northern Scotland.

     A healthy biodiversity brings benefits in the control of flooding, climate regulation and
     the provision of genetic materials for medicine. These are negatively affected by
     carbon emissions and so the reduction of oil use will maintain or re-establish these
     benefits.

     Increases in CO2 may enhance the productivity of some plants in natural ecosystems
     and agricultural systems. These increases may not compensate for other outcomes of
     climate change.

     Reducing dependence on oil implies the development/use of alternative sources of
     energy and raw materials (eg plastics/chemicals). Many of these alternatives have
     some negative environmental impacts. For example, hydro-electric power (HEP) may
     be considered a sustainable, non-carbon source of energy, but HEP dams have
     consequences for water and habitat/biodiversity both at their sites and downstream.
     Reducing dependence on oil may lead to more nuclear power stations, bringing their
     own environmental risks. Reduction of oil may not stop other contributors to climate
     and biodiversity change such as fuelwood.

     Stronger responses may challenge what is meant by “benefit” and conclude that most
     impacts of oil alternatives are neither positive nor negative but environmentally benign
     (neutral). Another approach might be to use the concept of scale and discuss how
     more localized environmental problems, eg nuclear accidents, must be balanced
     against the threat of global climate change on account of oil use. Some may examine
     the spatial variation of benefits.

     At band D, expect responses to describe some effects of reducing oil consumption.

     For band E, expect detailed explanation of a range of effects on climate and
     biodiversity of reduced oil consumption/alternative energy sources or some discussion
     of the extent to which the reduction in the use of oil will impact climate change and
     biodiversity, possibly at varying scales.

     For band F, expect both.
