1.   (a)    Explain how the price mechanism reallocates resources when there is an increase
            in demand for a good or service.                                                        [10]

            Answers may include:
             definitions of price mechanism, resources, demand
             diagram to show how an increase in demand leads to a reallocation of
              resources
             explanation of how the signalling and incentive functions of price lead to a
              reallocation of resources when demand increases for a good or service
             examples of goods and services where the price mechanism has
              reallocated resources because of an increase in demand.

            Answers may include:
             definition of indirect tax

              production

            NB Candidates who only explain one reason should not be awarded marks

(b)    Evaluate the impact that an increase in indirect tax might have on consumers
       and producers.                                                                        [15]

       Answers may include:
        definition of indirect tax
        diagram to show the impact of an indirect tax on consumers and producers

         and services and reduces the revenue producers receive from selling goods
         and services
        examples of how indirect taxes affect consumers and producers
        synthesis or evaluation.

       Evaluation may include: the relative impact may depend on PED and PES, indirect
       tax might benefit consumers if it is imposed on demerit goods, tax revenue raised
       can be used to benefit consumers and producers through government spending.

       Evaluation may include: The advantages of government policies used to promote
       efficiency. For example, government expenditure on health and education might
       improve the efficiency of the labour force and reducing tax on low income
       households might improve their incentive to work.

                   question.
                   Some relevant economic terms are defined.

                   Relevant economic terms are defined.
                   Relevant economic theory is explained and applied.
                   Where appropriate, diagrams are included and applied.
                   Where appropriate, examples are used.
                   There are few errors.

                   question.
                   Relevant economic terms are clearly defined.
                   Relevant economic theory is clearly explained and applied.
                   Where appropriate, diagrams are included and applied effectively.

(b)   To what extent is the use of national income statistics an effective way of comparing
      the standard of living between countries?                                                   [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of national income and standard of living
       diagram: a diagram is not required for this question
       explanation of how national income statistics are an effective way of making
        comparisons between countries
       examples of how national income statistics have been used to compare countries
       synthesis or evaluation (to what extent).

      Evaluation may include: consideration of the limitations of national income statistics to
      compare living standards such as: different methods of calculation, the impact of
      different types of output on living standards, environmental factors, crime levels,
      political instability, the exchange rate and income distribution.

      NB Definitions, theory, and examples that have already been given in part (a), and then
      referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.
