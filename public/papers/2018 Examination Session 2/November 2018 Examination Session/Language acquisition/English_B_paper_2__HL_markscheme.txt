Word count
At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in section A and 150 words in
section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in section A or 250 words in section B: the
whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.

   9–10
          The development of ideas is coherent and thorough; supporting details are highly
          appropriate.

 Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the accuracy of the
 information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
 Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided they meet
 the requirements of the task, and the ideas are sufficiently developed.

Question 5: Science and technology
Your local government has recently banned all petrol and diesel vehicles from your city centre,

          vehicles access to the city centre
        • describes vaguely or not at all the effects this scheme has had on the community

   permissible
