You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

     Farmer Brown has built a new barn, on horizontal ground, on his farm. The barn has a
     cuboid base and a triangular prism roof, as shown in the diagram.

     The roof was built using metal supports. Each support is made from five lengths of metal
     AE, ED, AD, EM and MN, and the design is shown in the following diagram.

     On one day 180 flights arrived at a particular airport. The distance travelled and the arrival
     status for each incoming flight was recorded. The flight was then classified as on time,
     slightly delayed, or heavily delayed.

     The results are shown in the following table.

     A χ2 test is carried out at the 10 % significance level to determine whether the arrival status
     of incoming flights is independent of the distance travelled.

     Give your answers to parts (b), (c) and (d) to the nearest whole number.

     Harinder has 14 000 US Dollars (USD) to invest for a period of five years. He has two
     options of how to invest the money.

     Option A: Invest the full amount, in USD, in a fixed deposit account in an American bank.

     The account pays a nominal annual interest rate of r % , compounded yearly, for the
     five years. The bank manager says that this will give Harinder a return of 17 500 USD.

     (a)   Calculate the value of r .                                                                [3]

     Option B: Invest the full amount, in Indian Rupees (INR), in a fixed deposit account in an
     Indian bank. The money must be converted from USD to INR before it is invested.

     The exchange rate is 1 USD = 66.91 INR.

     (b)   Calculate 14 000 USD in INR.                                                              [2]

     The account in the Indian bank pays a nominal annual interest rate of 5.2 % compounded
     monthly.

     (c)   Calculate the amount of this investment, in INR, in this account after five years.        [3]

     Harinder chose option B. At the end of five years, Harinder converted this investment back to
     USD. The exchange rate, at that time, was 1 USD = 67.16 INR.

     (d)   Calculate how much more money, in USD, Harinder earned by choosing option B
           instead of option A.                                                                      [3]

     without falling into a trap. Contestants choose doors at random.
     If they avoid a trap they progress to the next wall.
     If a contestant falls into a trap they exit the game before the next contestant plays.
     Contestants are not allowed to watch each other attempt the game.

     A manufacturer makes trash cans in the form of a cylinder with a hemispherical top.
     The trash can has a height of 70 cm. The base radius of both the cylinder and the
     hemispherical top is 20 cm.

                                                                             diagram not to scale

     (a)   Write down the height of the cylinder.                                                   [1]

     (b)   Find the total volume of the trash can.                                                  [4]

     A designer is asked to produce a new trash can.
     The new trash can will also be in the form of a cylinder with a hemispherical top.
     This trash can will have a height of H cm and a base radius of r cm.

                                                                             diagram not to scale

(Question 6 continued)

     There is a design constraint such that H + 2r = 110 cm .
     The designer has to maximize the volume of the trash can.

     (c)   Find the height of the cylinder, h , of the new trash can, in terms of r .                    [2]

     (d)   Show that the volume, V cm3 , of the new trash can is given by

                                               7
			                               V = 110πr 2 − πr 3 .                                                   [3]
                                               3

     (e)   Using your graphic display calculator, find the value of r which maximizes the value of V .   [2]

     The designer claims that the new trash can has a capacity that is at least 40 % greater than
     the capacity of the original trash can.

     (f)   State whether the designer’s claim is correct. Justify your answer.                           [4]
