Option B — Modelling and simulation

5.   Ralph owns a furniture store that trades in second-hand furniture, lamps and musical
     instruments. He buys these items, repairs them where necessary and then resells them.

     He calculates the value of each item using the information below:
     • type: furniture, lamp, musical instrument
     • brand recognition: 1 (low), 2 (medium), 3 (high)
     • condition: “very good”, “good”, “needs repair”
     • estimated volume of item: maximum volume accepted is 2000 dm3
       (note that 1 dm3 = 1 litre).

     Ralph is going to use a spreadsheet to model this information.

     (a)   Copy and complete the following table showing the variables, each variable’s data type
           and range of values that would represent the information shown above.                    [4]

                        Variable             Data type            Range of values




     The spreadsheet model will inform Ralph as to whether he should buy an item. The decision
     to buy is based on the following rules:
     • the default values for the items are; furniture $100, lamp $30, musical instrument $80
     • multipliers are applied to these default values depending on the volume of the item;
        for volumes that are 500 dm3 or above it is 0.7, for volumes less than or equal to
        30 dm3 it is 1.2, for any other volume it is 1.

     Ralph will not buy any item with a value calculated to be over $90.

     (b)   (i)    Using the above rules, construct the pseudocode that will help Ralph in deciding
                  whether to buy an item.                                                           [4]

           (ii)   Describe two items that would have a calculated value of more than $90.           [2]

(Option B, question 5 continued)

     The model is also used to calculate his final selling price for each item. This price is
     calculated using the following rules:
     • initial selling value is 5 times the original default value
     • a multiplier of 1, 2 or 3 is applied to reflect the brand recognition (a “top brand” receives a
        multiplier of 3)
     • another multiplier is applied to reflect the volume occupied. This multiplier is 5 when the
        volume is greater or equal to 500 dm3, 3 for volumes between 30 and 500 dm3 and 1 for
        other volumes
     • a further multiplier is applied depending upon the item’s condition. This multiplier is 2 or 3
        when conditions are good or very good, but is 0.8 if the item is damaged.

     (c)   Calculate the selling price of a top brand guitar with a volume of 96 dm3 that was
           damaged. You should show your working.                                                       [2]

6.   In a small shop two people prepare and sell bread rolls. The space for preparing the bread
     rolls is small. This space includes a sink and a cash register. Each of the ingredients used
     to fill the bread rolls is kept in a separate bowl with its own fork or spoon. Sometimes the
     bowls need to be refilled.

     Preparing a bread roll requires the following steps:
     • slice the bread roll
     • spread its base with some sauce
     • add lettuce
     • fill with at most two chosen fillings
     • cover the roll with the other half
     • wrap it in paper.

     After that, the roll is ready for payment and collection.

     Even when the shop is busy, each person only prepares one bread roll at a time.

     (a)   Outline two problems with this method of preparation that could affect the time it takes
           the two people to prepare an order.                                                          [4]

     A larger restaurant is already using simulation software for the preparation of their dishes.

     The restaurant has a menu with eight possible dishes. These dishes may require a
     number of steps such as cutting, mixing, boiling and grilling to prepare them, as well as
     different cooking times. The restaurant has a cook and an assistant who prepare one dish
     at the time.

     (c)   Explain the difference between a model and a simulation.                                 [3]

     (d)   Identify three elements that the simulation software might consider, in addition to the
           information already described above.                                                     [3]

     The simulation program will group all orders received in an interval of 10 minutes. The
     program will then produce a sequence of all the cooking steps so that these orders can
     be completed as quickly as possible. Once the kitchen has completed the orders for one
     interval, it is ready to accept orders for the next interval.

     Customers are impressed by the rapidity of service, but not by the quality of prepared food.

     (e)   Suggest two elements that the software simulation may have not considered that may
           lead to complaints from the customers.                                                   [6]


7.   The electronic control unit (ECU) of a vehicle is an on-board computer that is constantly
     monitoring the performance of several components of a vehicle. For example, the ECU:
     • controls the functioning of the lights, the brakes, the airbag, and the fuel-level signal
     • permits the scale being changed in some digital displays, such as switching the
       speedometer from miles/hour to km/hour.

     The software embedded in an ECU receives input data from a variety of sources when it runs
     auto-diagnostic tests.

     (a)   With relation to the activities that the software of an ECU has to perform:

           (i)    identify two of the sources that provide input data to the ECU;                   [2]

           (ii)   suggest one reason why the auto-diagnostic program in the ECU depends upon
                  the make and model of the vehicle.                                                [2]

     Vehicles are tested for their exhaust gas emissions using simulation software at specialist
     garages. During a period of 5 minutes, a vehicle with the engine switched on is monitored for
     emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and fine particulates. The software uses 3D visualization
     techniques to display these parameters on a screen for the whole duration of the test.

     (b)   Explain how emissions of CO2 and fine particulates could be represented in 3D by
           the software.                                                                            [4]

8.   Neural networks are often used to model the complex behaviour of systems. These
     networks must first be trained in order to establish a reliable model. One such method of
     training makes use of supervized learning algorithms.

     (a)   Outline the basic steps involved in supervized learning algorithms.                        [4]

     The following block diagram illustrates a neural network used by a supervized learning
     algorithm to calculate a resulting value RES, for a given set of inputs.

                   Input Layer        Hidden Layer        Outermost Layer

     The neural network in the block diagram contains 60 nodes in the input layer (block I),
     36 nodes in the hidden layer (block H) and 6 nodes in the outermost layer (block O).
     The solid black arrows indicate that all nodes in one layer are feeding all nodes in the
     successive layer. In particular, the value RES is calculated by using all nodes in O.

     (b)   Calculate the number of weights that the above neural network uses in producing a
           value for RES. Show the details of your calculation.                                       [2]

9.    An image processing system analyses colour images of architectural landscapes. The
      system compares any new images with existing ones stored in a knowledge base. The
      purpose of the system is to extend the knowledge base with images of the same scenes
      taken either from different perspectives or at different times of the year or with different
      weather conditions.

      (a)   Explain how cluster analysis can be used to achieve the aims of the system that is

      accounts.

      (a)   Outline the relationship between the Internet and the world wide web (WWW).               [2]

      (b)   Explain why the choice of browser should not affect a customer’s ability to access their
            bank account details.                                                                     [4]

      (c)   State two features that make HTTPS more suitable than HTTP in the context of

      Access to a bank’s home banking services requires, as a first step, identification and
      authentication of the user. Individuals log on the bank web site, and enter their own personal
      space by providing their full account number and a personal code that the bank gave them.
      The processing of this information takes place on the server side.

      (d)   Explain why server-side processing is used in this case.                                  [3]

      The 20 most recent account transactions can be displayed on screen in a webpage that uses
      XML. A print-out of all transactions of the past three months may be obtained by clicking an
      onscreen button on the webpage. The print-out is landscape oriented and shows many more
      columns than are displayed on the screen.

12.   RunAndBeyond is a sports knowledge website, offering expert knowledge and technical tips
      on sport disciplines. Official teams and associations are invited to include some of their own
      multimedia digital resources to RunAndBeyond.

      A team of triathletes, finding their sport discipline under-represented in the website, wants
      to contribute content for RunAndBeyond. The team intends to use a wiki in collaborating
      online with other similar interested groups in triathlon when creating and updating their own
      resource.

      (a)   Describe how a wiki can support the ongoing collaboration in producing the triathletes’

The total number of points collected during the current year will determine which of the three
status levels they are assigned for the following year: For example only the points collected in
2018 will determine the status level for 2019.

Occasionally, new customers receive additional bonus points as part of a promotion.

The Points class keeps details of the points and status levels of each customer.
public class Points
{
  private String memberId; // id of the hotel customer
  private int totalPoints; // this year's points
  private int bonusPoints; // any bonus points given to this year's new member
  private String statusNow; // current(this year's)status
  private String statusNextYear; // following year's status
  private Visits[] allVisits = new Visits[366];//details of each visit
                                        		     // during this year
  int y;                    // number of visits this year

 public Points(String id) // constructor for new member
 {
		 memberId = id;
		 bonusPoints = 0;
		 y = 0;
		statusNow = "Bronze";
 }

 //constructor for new member given bonus points (valid for current year only)
 public Points(String id, int bp)
 {
		 memberId = id;
		 bonusPoints = bp; // multiples of 1000 - maximum number is 5000
		 y = 0;
		statusNow = "Bronze";
 }

    // all the accessor and mutator methods are present but not shown

 public Visits getAllVisits(int v)
 {
		return allVisits[v];
 }

 public void addVisit(Visits v) // adds a new Visit object to the array
 {
		 allVisits[y] = v;
		 y = y + 1;
 }

15.   The instance variables in the Points class are preceded by the modifier private. The
      choice of modifier affects the way in which these variables are accessed or used.

      (a)   With the use of two examples other than private, outline how the choice of this
            modifier affects the way in which these variables are accessed or used.                      [4]

      (b)   With reference to the two methods with the same name in the Points class,
            explain the OOP feature that makes it possible to successfully implement either of
            these methods.                                                                               [4]

      The customers will be assigned one of three levels for the following year (Gold, Silver or
      Bronze) depending upon the current year’s total points as follows.
      • Bronze = less than 10 000 points
      • Silver = 10 000 or more but less than 50 000
      • Gold = 50 000 or more.

      In 2018, Tim became a member for the first time and was awarded a bonus of
      1000 points. So far, in 2018, Tim has stayed three times at one of these hotels. The first visit
      lasted 2 days, the second visit lasted 1 day and the third visit lasted 6 days.

      (c)   State the status level that Tim has been assigned, for 2019, following these visits.         [1]

      The different Points objects are stored in an array which is declared globally in the main
      (driver) class as follows: Points[] allPoints = new Points[10000];

      (d)   State how an individual object can be identified using this array.                           [1]

      The attribute statusNow is assigned its correct value at the beginning of every year for
      existing members. It cannot be changed during the year.

      (e)   Construct the method isGold() in the Points class, which will return whether the
            current status is “Gold”.                                                                    [3]

16.   The details of hotel stays during the current year are stored in the variable allVisits which
      is an array of the Visits class. allVisits is used in determining the total points awarded in
      the current year.

      The Visits class is outlined below:

      public class Visits
      {
        private String hotelCode;           //   id of the hotel
        private int days;                   //   number of days of the visit

       public Visits(String h, int d)
       {
      		 hotelCode = h;
      		 days = d;
       }

        public int getDays()
        {
      		return days;
        }
      }

      (a)   Construct a UML diagram for the Visits class.                                            [3]

      The main (driver) class manages the Points and Visits classes. It contains the
      following code:

      Points[] allPoints = new Points[10000]; // declared globally

      allPoints[0] = new Points("m100");
      allPoints[1] = new Points("m101",5000);
      allPoints[2] = new Points("m102",2000);

      Visits v1 = new Visits("h003", 3);
      Visits v2 = new Visits("h013", 1);
      Visits v3 = new Visits("h013", 2);
      Visits v4 = new Visits("h005", 6);

      allPoints[0].addVisit(v1);
      allPoints[0].addVisit(v2);
      allPoints[0].addVisit(v3);
      allPoints[0].addVisit(v4);
      allPoints[1].addVisit(v1);
      allPoints[1].addVisit(new Visits("h004",6));

      (b)   State the output given by the following statements:

            (i)     System.out.println(allPoints[2].getMemberId()); [1]

            (ii)    System.out.println(allPoints[0].getBonusPoints());[1]

            (iii)   System.out.println(allPoints[1].getAllVisits(1).getDays());[1]

      (c)   Construct the method calculateTotalPoints(), in the Points class, which will
            calculate and return the total number of points awarded so far in the current year.         [5]

      (d)   Construct the method daysMissing(), in the Points class, that will return the
            number of extra days that a customer needs to stay in order to keep the same status
            the following year as they have in the current year.                                        [7]

      The hotel chain maintains the details of the extra benefits that each status provides in
      appropriate classes.

      (e)   Suggest how the hotel chain might make use of the inheritance feature of OOP when
            designing the classes from pages 18 and 20.                                                 [4]

      At midnight on 31st December each year the systems are temporarily made unavailable as
      the hotel chain makes the changes needed to prepare the system for the new year.

      (f)   Identify three changes that would have to be made to the classes previously described
            in order for the system to function correctly in the new year.                              [3]


17.   Full details of each hotel are stored as objects of the Hotel class.

      For research purposes, the managers want to identify the name of the hotel in which a
      particular customer has stayed the most days during the current year.

      Without writing code, outline the steps that would have to be taken to accomplish this.
      You should include reference to any classes, methods or attributes that will be created or will
      be needed.                                                                                        [7]

18.   Full details of the customers are stored as objects of the Customer class. This class is
      partially shown below:

      public class Customer
      {
        private String memberId;
        private String email; //email address (assume only 1 per customer)

       public Customer(String a, String b)
       {
      		 memberId = a;
      		 email = b;

       }

        public String getEmail()
        {
      		return email;
        }
      }

      The objects can be accessed through the linked list allCustomers which is declared in the
      main (driver) class as follows:

      LinkedList<Customer> allCustomers = new LinkedList<Customer>();

      (a)   Outline why a linked list structure has been chosen for allCustomers.[2]

      (b)   Construct the method goldMails() that will return an ArrayList containing the email
            addresses of all current “Gold” members. You should make use of any previously
