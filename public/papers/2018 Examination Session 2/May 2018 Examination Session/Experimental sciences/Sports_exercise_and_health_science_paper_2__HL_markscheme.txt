     Question                                      Answers                                                    Notes                     Total

                  movement ✔                                                                                                           2 max

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.
8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

                    multiple genes determine the measurable heritable characteristics for each

             physical maturation of a person may not allow them to carry out some tasks if they are either
             too young or too old ✔
             experience may be lacking for some people who are too young whereas someone who has
             experience will be familiar with expectations ✔

             Difficulty of task:
             progress will be slowed if the task is too difficult for the learner ✔

                speed of release is defined as the magnitude of the projectile’s velocity vector at       sport.
                the instant of release ✔
                                                                                                          Note examples provided are from golf.
                when projectile angle and height are held constant, speed of release will
                determine range (horizontal displacement) ✔
                speed of club head can be improved / increased through training good technique /
                strength, coordination and power / optimal club weight / club selection ✔

                Height of release:
                greater the height of the tee off point to the landing point the greater the horizontal
                distance that can be gained ✔

                Angle of release:
                there is an optimal angle for various shots in order to gain maximum distance ✔
                optimal angle can depend on wind resistance / height of release compared to
                landing ✔
                club faces are angled to provide various release angles ✔

                spin on a ball has a contributing influence on the motion / distance achieved ✔
                how the club face contacts/interacts with the ball will determine the nature of the
                spin on the ball ✔

                make the surface of the object / person a smooth texture <which will prevent a fluid
                layer forming> ✔
                eg, wearing tight clothing / shaving down / wearing swimming hats ✔
                Form drag:
                reduce front cross-sectional area will reduce the amount of drag produced ✔

                a curved design allows fluid to pass more smoothly (laminar flow) minimizing drag ✔
                eg, use of a specialist cycling helmet ✔
                Wave drag:
                by reducing the interface between two fluids will reduce drag ✔

                the age of the interacting surfaces «eg, sports shoe is smooth which would lower the
                coefficient of friction» ✔

                between surfaces / grip ✔
                mass of an object determines the perpendicular force and this affects static friction ✔
                motionless objects <static friction>often experience more friction than moving ones
                <dynamic friction> ✔
                temperature of surface eg, warming of F1 / Superbike tyres to increase grip on the
                track ✔
