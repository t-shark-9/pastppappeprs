24.   The Jerrycan, see Figure 10, was developed in Germany in the 1930s for military use.
      It became a much sought-after item because it was engineered to a much higher standard than

      allowed for expansion and increased strength, and a handle design that allowed it to be carried by
      one or two people. Its iconic status is demonstrated by continued availability of and the use of the
      term “Jerrycan” in reference to all fuel containers.
