      Access control;
      this means that different users will have different levels of access to the Galaxy
      Bank database;
      Therefore customers will only be able to access the information that they require
      to carry out their transactions;
      Whereas other users such as the DBA will have access to more of the database;
      Ensuring that the sensitive information within the Galaxy Bank database is secure
      from unauthorized access, editing etc.;                                              [3]

      Row locking prevents two or more database users from updating the same data
      at the same time;
      When a row is locked it means that another database session cannot update that
      data until the lock is released (which unlocks the data and allows other database
      users to update that data;
      If the database as a whole is locked, then only one database session can apply
      any updates; Locks are done using statements;                                        [3]

           The recovery method recovers a past copy of the database;
           Backed up to archival storage and reconstructs a more current state by redoing
           the operations of committed transactions, up to the time of failure.

           Deferred Update;
           To support ABORT and machine failure scenarios;
           While a transaction runs, no changes made by that transaction are recorded in
           the Database;
           On a commit, new data is recorded in a log file and flushed to the disk;
           New data is then recorded in the database itself;

           Normalization leads to a reduction in the chance of data redundancy occurring;
           Because each item of data only occurs on one location in the database;
           Therefore this can reduce the possibility of update anomalies occurring;
           More efficient use of memory;

           Normalization reduces the likelihood of update anomalies occurring;
           Because each item of data only occurs on one location in the database;
           Therefore if the data is edited there is no chance that the data may exist in its
           original form anywhere else in the database;

           Normalization leads to smaller tables with less information in each row;
           This leads to a reduction of input/output transfers;
           Which means that the likelihood of CPU activities being suspended are
           reduced/the CPU is able to work at full capacity;

           Note: Do not award marks between clusters.                                           [3]

           repeat rows for students with multiple choices / phone numbers with one choice
           per row;
           Each record must have a unique key;

           For Student_Choice have three columns, Stud_Choice1, Stud_Choice2 and
           Stud_Choice3, with null values (or default values set to “none”) as appropriate or

(e)   2NF allows non-prime attributes to be functionally dependent on non-prime
      attributes which means there are transitive dependencies at 2NF;
      While 3NF allows non-prime attributes to be functionally dependent only on the
      primary / super key and is already in 2NF;
      Therefore it is not possible for update anomalies to occur when a database is in
      3NF;                                                                               [3]

      Mark as [3] and [3].

      The objective of reducing turn-around time,
      May lead to hastily prepared dishes,
      Which may be lacking in quality.

      Trying to cook a batch of orders in 10 minutes,
      May require the pans to be used for multiple dishes,
      Impacting the unique taste of these dishes.

      More appliances might need to be switched on, in case of large orders demand;
      For example, an oven, which take time to heat up;
      Causing some dishes to be undercooked;

      The number of customers/orders;
      May be too high;
      To be dealt with in 10 minutes;

      Being in charge of preparing a full dish, gives job satisfaction;
      Lack of satisfaction may lead to loss of interest in the job;

7.   (a)   Award up to [2 max].

           Award [1 max] for Internet and [1 max] for WWW.

           Internet is a network of (networks of) computers that can communicate one with
           each other;
           To exchange/access information through the WWW;

           The WWW is a way to access/share/exchange information using software
           applications;
           Using the Internet as a physical medium;

           Internet allows the transmission of data;
           That constitute the information that applications on the WWW may want to
           share/access/exchange;

           The WWW provides, through hyperlinks, a level of connectivity of resources
           (logical connectivity);
           Which can be physically sparse, but connected in a network in the Internet;         [2]

     (b)   Award up to [4 max]:

           to [2 max];

           Standards are applied by the browser;
           For interpreting the HTML (XML);
           So that the all information will appear, and also (more or less) as expected;

           Protocols are used;
           To build up the communication at different levels of the architecture;
           All browsers will rely upon the same internet protocols (TCP/IP);
           That is essential for interoperability in transmission/communication;
           So that the IP address is retrieved (via the DNS server);                           [4]

           Award [2 max] for a generic response.

      The bank needs to store all passwords in its server, including the credentials
      given to the users;
      So that the comparison with the individual’s entry happens in the bank with the
      local database;
      To the purpose of guaranteeing security;
      And to possibly perform other operations (tracking log-ins or transactions);

      The bank cannot send out password to be processed on the client’s side;
      This will not be a guarantee for security for the bank/it may introduce
      vulnerabilities/sensitive data cannot be sent out in the public domain;
      Hence the comparison with the individual’s entry must happen in the bank with
      the local database;

      Note: Do not award marks between clusters.                                              [3]

      XML is used to create/organize the data on the internal database;
      By clicking the virtual button a script is run that transforms the information on the
      database into the print-out form;
      Stylesheet in XSLT transforms XML into an output form;
      The script contains instructions on how to access the database (which fields are
      relevant) and how to present the information for the final form for the printer;

      By clicking the virtual button a script is run;
      Which uses XML to retrieve/select the required data from the internal
      database/server;
      Which is displayed using XSLT into an appropriate output form (on the screen);
      The script also contains instructions for the correct printout of data;

           Note: An expansion from the technical/computational perspective only (not
           sociological one) is expected about aspects of the chosen method of online
           interaction.

           Aspects that can gain credit:
           Editing, permissions layer, ownership, tracking of updates, security (open to
           vandalism/non-monitored contributors), open source (interoperability).

           Software for wikis provides collaborative editing sharing of information of content,
           directly from the browser;
           Updates are usually tracked in wikis (also to be removed afterwards) as they
           come from different authors / usually non-moderated / added content can also be
           removed later on (also by others);
           The evolution of a wiki is more immediate and spontaneous because updates are
           immediately visible;
           The wiki can easily be vandalized with incorrect/unauthoritative information, but it
           can also be quickly amended/corrected if this is realized quickly;                     [3]

           Lossy compression results in files of smaller size;
           It may be needed for video streaming because the server provides execution
           through scripting;
           And guaranteeing streaming without interruptions is a priority;
           It may be a choice for downloading video for local execution to manage outgoing
           traffic on popular servers/increases the speed (using smaller files);                  [4]

           an extension describing how the technology is used and interacts with other
           components.

           Example 1:
           An interactive web page that has an auto-refresh/automatic update extension;
           So that every N seconds a script is executed to reload the page;
           The web page is linked to an underlined database/data source
           OR interrogates specific databases/news databanks;
           That are distributed and collectively provide regular updates;
           And they can be displayed back using the script;

           Example 2:
           A dynamic web page equipped with a RSS feed;
           That collects/aggregates news from sources that cover that live event;
           The feed is in form of an update in XML;
           Therefore, it can be used to feed an underlining (distributed) database or the web
           page/uses syndication/can be immediately interpreted by the browser;
           And it can then be processed by some script to be displayed back in the original
           web page;                                                                             [4]

                 Award [1] for showing understanding of the need of each of the following:
                 GPS, mapping software, underlying distributed information.

                 The GPS of the device gives its current location (coordinates);

                 Coordinates sent out through the Internet (with 3G/4G/5G/Wifi/using the
                 specific features of the mobile device OS);

                 Coordinates are linked to map software (eg Googlemaps) to retrieve
                 current’s device position and neighbourhood information (using thematic
                 databases);

                 And integrated with further annotations (relative to museums) that can be
                 provided by third-party services;
                    OR by information incrementally gathered from users;
                    OR by further databases (GIS services);
                    OR by interrogating an (incremental) database accessible from the
                    server where the app has been downloaded from, for its first installation;   [3]

      (ii)   Award up to [2 max].

             Award [1] for identifying a feature and award [1] for reasonable expansion of the
             feature up to [2 max].

             Example 1:
             The design of the front-end (the user interface) with the specific mobile
             device;
             So that the commands are specific (and built-in) within the device, to
             support interactive use;
             (With the effect that the app can be used across a range of devices and
             mobile operating systems;)

             Example 2:
             To personalize the app with a “history” on the client’s side, after the first use
             of the application;
             So that only the new information added in the database (underlying sources
             used by the app) can be fetched by the client’s script;                             [2]

             Relevance of content between source and target page;
             Time to download;
             …(there are others).                                                                [2]

      (ii)   Award up to [5 max].
             Old information is more likely to be retrieved by web crawlers;
             But this requires time to crawl;
             But this interferes with the response time for the current search;
             And it may even be penalised by policies in search engines;
             Without returning currently relevant information;
             Example of old information are old or broken links/orphan pages/old text
             masked by comments in the HTML code, and it can be revised from time to
             time;
             Cleanly written code allows for a more efficient search process;
             Which facilitates correct indexing;

      In P2P all machines can interchangeably be client as well as server (no division
      of client-server);
      Data and services can be replicated across sites, and be retrieved from them;
      Services are virtualized/reside on virtual machines;

      Therefore, if one node is unavailable the service can still be provided by resorting
      to other nodes;
      OR
      System updates can be made while not interrupting the provision of the service

            The constructor methods have a different number / type of parameters / different
            parameters;
            The method calling the constructor / compiler will determine which of these
            methods is selected;

11.   (a)   Award [1] for three compartments, [1] for correct + and –, and [1] for correct
            contents.

                   Visits
                   - hotelCode: String
                   - days: int
                   + Visits(String, int)
                   + getDays():int

            Note:
            • allow variations in the format, but must use + / –
            • accept additional getters/setters, but the given content must be present.        [3]

      (b)   (i)      m102;                                                                     [1]

      (c)   Example 1:
            public int calculateTotalPoints()
            {
              int totalPoints = 0;
              for (int x = 0; x < y; x++)
              {
                 totalPoints = totalPoints + allVisits[x].getDays();
              }
              totalPoints = totalPoints * 1000 + bonusPoints;
              return totalPoints;
            }

            Award marks for correctly including the following:
            Signature + matching return;
            Loop through the number of visits (y); // do not allow length statements;
            Any use of allVisits array;
            Correct update of totalPoints (with or without bonusPoints);
            Inclusion of bonus points outside of the loop (or if the loop is absent);

            Example 2:
            public int calculateTotalPoints()
            {
              int totalDays = 0;
                 for (int x = 0; x < y; x++)
                 {
                   totalDays = totalDays + allVisits[x].getDays();
                 }
                 totalPoints = totalDays * 1000 + bonusPoints;
                 return totalPoints;
            }                                                                                  [5]

(d)   public int daysMissing()
      {
        int pointsNeeded = 0;
        int points;

          // convert present status to minimum number of days
          if (statusNow.equals("Silver"))     // allow = or use of
                                              // isSilver()
            pointsNeeded = 10000;
          else if (statusNow.equals("Gold")) // allow = or use of
                                              // isGold()
            pointsNeeded = 50000;

          else
          {
               return 0;
          }
      }

      Award marks for correctly including the following:
      Signature + return of an integer;
      All required declaration (initialization if needed);
      Conversion to points/days for all 3 statuses // bronze can be the default;
      Calculation of points missing (allow getTotalPoints() or the variable
      totalPoints for calculateTotalPoints()) ;
      Convert to days (divide by 1000) // allow if the conversion has already taken place;
      Returning calculated number; // allow even if negative or if incorrect or without an
      if else clause;
      Returning 0 // when the points needed would have been negative / when
      required points have already been gained;

(e)   A generic class / Status / Point / Bronze class can be used as a superclass;
      Sub-classes can then be created (2 or 3) for the individual statuses;
      Containing elements specific to them / overriding superclass methods;
      And inheriting methods/variables required by all status levels from the
      superclass;

      Do not award more than [2] for a generic response.                                         [4]

(f)   (In the Points class) statusNow = statusNextYear;
      bonusPoints set to 0 (accept reset bonusPoints);
      totalPoints set to 0 (accept reset totalPoints);
      variable y (that counts the visits) needs to be set to 0;
      statusNextYear = Bronze (accept reset statusNextYear);

      Note: Do not accept “array allVisits reinitialised to empty”.                          [3 max]

12.   Award up to [ 7 max]. Note there are 9 marking points.

      An array of objects / 2 parallel arrays would be created / any other appropriate
      structure; // Do not allow 2D array;
      Containing hotel codes and number of days;
      Repeat/loop for each object in the allVisits array;
      (i) Inspect the hotel ids and days stayed / find a matching hotel;
      (ii) Update the array(s); // see first note below
      (iii) By increasing the number of days (for the specific hotel);
      Sort / search / look for / find; // see first note below;
      The object / hotel code with the largest number of days;
      Find the name of the hotel using the hotel code / Hotel class;                        [7 max]

      Note:
      • mps can be awarded even if the wrong values are being updated or searched for
        (eg stays instead of days).
      • For mp 7 only allow the use of “look for” and “find” if accompanied by a suitable
        description.
