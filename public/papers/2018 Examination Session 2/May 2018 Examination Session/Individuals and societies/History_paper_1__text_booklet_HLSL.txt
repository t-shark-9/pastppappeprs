The Mongols ordered that, apart from four hundred artisans and some children whom they bore off into
captivity … the whole population, including the women and [the rest of the] children, should be killed, and
no one be spared. The people of Merv were then distributed among the soldiers and, in short, to each
man was allotted the execution of three or four hundred persons … So many had been killed by nightfall
that … the plain was soaked with the blood of the mighty …

[At Nishapur] they severed the heads of the slain from their bodies and heaped them in piles, keeping
those of the men separate from those of the women and children …

Flies and wolves feasted on the breasts of sadrs [religious dignitaries]; eagles on mountain tops regaled
[filled] themselves with the flesh of delicate women.

[At its height] Merv was a cultural capital, attracting the brightest thinkers and artists from around the
Islamic world … To be marwazi (from Merv) suggested a degree of cultivation and sophistication ...
Though secluded in an oasis in the Karakum desert, Merv was a worldly city, an exemplar of the
commercial and intellectual culture that flourished along the Silk Road.

Merv was also no stranger to political upheaval and war … [but no] conquest was as traumatic as its
pillage by the Mongols in 1221 … According to the [Muslim] historian Ibn al-Athir, who based his account
on the reports of refugees from Merv: “Genghis Khan ordered the troops who had been seized should
be brought before him … they were executed and the people looked on and wept. When it came to
the common people, they separated men, women, children and possessions … They took the wealthy
people and beat them and tortured them with all sorts of cruelties in the search for wealth … Then they
set fire to the city and burned the tomb of Sultan Sanjar and dug up his grave looking for money. They
said, ‘These people have resisted us’ so they killed them all.”

                          identify her as a Jewish woman when confessing at her Inquisitorial Trial on
                          22 October 1495.

I, Inés López, appear before Your Reverences with the greatest contrition [remorse] and repentance for
my sins … I declare, My Lords, that I did not do servants’ work on some Saturdays, and on Sundays
I put on clean clothes. And, sometimes I ate food that was prepared on Friday for Saturday, and I lit
candles on Friday evening in accordance with Jewish ritual.

Likewise, I observed some of the Jewish fasts, [fasting] until nightfall. Moreover, I sometimes observed
Jewish holidays, when I found out about them from a cousin of mine named Isabel de Lobón, when I was
[staying] with her, for she was a widow. And she told me, for the benefit of my soul, to especially observe
Passover, for the aforementioned Isabel de Lobón every so often gave me [unleavened bread], warning
me not to tell anyone. The aforementioned Isabel de Lobón has left Villarreal [Ciudad Real]; for where,
no one knows.

Likewise, I removed the fat from meat whenever I could. Likewise, My Lords, I declare that I ate on low
tables at funeral banquets.

                         Inquisition 1478–1614 (2006).

The Spanish Inquisition was created in 1478 because of a heresy which Church authorities called
“judaizing”: judaizers were Christians who allegedly continued to practice Jewish ceremonies and
espouse [promote] Jewish beliefs. Spain had the largest population of Jews in Western Europe until
1391, when preaching by Dominican friars provoked the forced baptism of Jews and the destruction
of their neighbourhoods. Almost instantaneously, these “new” Christians, called conversos, generated
debate within Spanish society; questions arose as to whether they were sincere in their new beliefs,
and whether they should be allowed to hold the public and ecclesiastical offices that were now open
to them because of their baptism … Antagonism toward the conversos was inflamed by their social
success since many converso families deftly [skilfully] climbed a social hierarchy that had been off-limits
before their baptism. Conversos came to occupy 85 percent of the posts on the city council of Cuenca,
held prominent positions at the royal court, and could achieve remarkable success in the Church.
Historians think the conversos’ social prominence [importance] compounded [intensified] local, urban
rivalries and resulted in controversy throughout the fifteenth century.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

Read sources I to L and answer questions 9 to 12. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Japanese expansion in East Asia (1931–1941) — Causes of expansion: political instability in China.

Source I                   Jonathan D Spence, an historian, writing in the academic book The Search for
                           Modern China (1999).

The outbreak of full-scale war with Japan in 1937 ended any chance that Jiang Jieshi might have had of
creating a strong and centralized nation-state. Within a year, the Japanese deprived the Guomindang
[the Nationalists] of all the major Chinese industrial centers and the most fertile farmland. Jiang’s new
wartime base, Chongqing, became a symbolic center for national resistance to the Japanese, but it
was a poor place from which to launch any kind of counterattack. Similarly, the Communist forces were
isolated in Shaanxi province, one of the poorest areas in China, with no industrial capacity. It was not
clear if the Communists would be able to survive there, and certainly it seemed an unpromising location
from which to spread the revolution.

For the first years of the war, the dream of national unity was kept alive by the nominal [in name only]
alliance of the Nationalist and Communist forces in a united front. Communists muted [reduced the
focus on] their land reform practices and moderated their rhetoric [propaganda], while the Guomindang
tried to undertake economic and administrative reforms that would strengthen China in the long term.
But by early 1941 the two parties were once again engaging in armed clashes with each other.

                           War and Popular Culture: Resistance in Modern China, 1937–1945 (1994).

The outbreak of full-scale war with Japan in 1937 dealt a devastating blow to the Nationalist
[Guomindang] government’s efforts to recentralize its authority and revive the economy. It also ended
Jiang Jieshi’s chance of crushing the Communist forces, who were isolated in the barren and sparsely
populated Shaanxi province. The war displaced the Nationalists from their traditional power base in
the urban and industrial centers, and forced them to move to the interior. At the same time, it provided
an ideal opportunity for the Communists to expand their influence in north China and become a true
contender for national power.

For many Chinese resisters, the clash with Japan turned out to be a unifying force. The Marco Polo
Bridge became a compelling symbol of China’s unity. Resisters looked at war as an antidote to chaos.
Despite some progress made toward economic growth and political integration by the Nationalist
government on the eve of the war, the country was still largely fragmented. Regional militarists remained
a serious threat to the government, and the armed conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists
persisted. Political instability bred fear and fueled great discontent in society.

                        Fraud, Sham and Hoax” (4 July 1964).

[This Act] is a sham, and a hoax [trick]. This law will live in infamy [shame] … Never before in the
history of this nation have so many human rights been destroyed by a single Act of Congress. It is an
act of tyranny. It is the assassin’s knife stuck in the back of liberty.

Today this tyranny is imposed by the central federal government which claims the right to rule over
our lives ... Every person in every aspect of our daily lives becomes subject to the criminal provisions
[clauses] of this bill. It makes the exercise of our freedoms a federal crime … I am having nothing to do
with this so-called Civil Rights Bill.

We will not stand idly by while the [US] Supreme Court continues to invade the prerogatives [powers] left
[granted] rightly to the states by the American constitution.

A left wing monster has risen up in this nation. It has invaded the government … and it intends to destroy
the freedom and liberty of you and me … Red China and Soviet Russia are prime examples of what will
happen.

Every device [method] of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny the negro the right to
vote. The negro citizen may go to register [for the vote] only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour
is late, or the official in charge is absent. And if he persists, he may be disqualified because he did not
spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application … The fact is that the
only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin …

The real hero of this struggle is the American negro. His actions and protests, his courage to risk safety
and even to risk his life, have awakened the conscience of this nation … And who among us can say
that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery, and his faith in
American democracy.
