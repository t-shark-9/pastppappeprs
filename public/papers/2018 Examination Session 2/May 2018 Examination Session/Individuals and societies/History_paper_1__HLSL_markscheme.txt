Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1. (a)     What, according to Source B, happened to the populations of Merv and Nishapur?            [3]

           • By implication, most of the population of Merv was killed.
           • 400 artisans of Merv were spared as were some children who were taken into captivity.
           • At Nishapur the dead were decapitated and/or the bodies/heads of the men were kept
             separate from the bodies of the women.
           • In both places the level of violence was substantial.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source A suggest about Genghis Khan’s relations with other leaders?             [2]

           • Genghis Khan was feared and/or respected by other leaders.
           • Genghis Khan was prepared to accept diplomatic relations with other leaders.
           • There may have been ongoing distrust between the two parties as both sides are armed.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source C
     for an historian studying the Mongol conquests under Genghis Khan.                               [4]

     Value:
     • The source was written in 2016 and provides context of the long-term impact of the Mongol
       conquest of Merv, which is described as a “lost city”.
     • The source indicates that there was a substantial human and cultural cost to the Mongol
       conquest of the city.
     • Part of the source is based on contemporary accounts of the attack on Merv and/or there is a
       suggestion that only those areas that offered resistance were annihilated.

     Limitations:
     • The author is a writer and broadcaster rather than a professional historian and the intention is
       likely to pique the interest of a general readership.
     • It is written for a newspaper as part of a series of articles on lost cities and may lack depth.
     • The source uses dramatic language and the excerpt within the source is from a Muslim
       historian’s accounts of refugees from Merv and is, therefore, likely to exaggerate the brutality of
       the Mongols.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
     are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
     supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
     be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources B and D reveal about the nature of Mongol conquests.             [6]

      Marks     Level descriptor
       5–6      • The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
       3–4      • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                   although these points may lack clarity.
        1–2     • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or general
                   comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison or of
                   contrast.
         0      • The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and award
     credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
     candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
     no set answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources comment on the events at Merv and Nishapur and reveal the extent of bloodshed
       that took place during the Mongol conquests.
     • Both sources reveal that the killings that took place were not only the result of military conflicts
       but also of massacres of civilian populations.
     • Both sources show that Muslim historians portray the Mongols and/or Genghis Khan negatively.
       Source D states that Muslim historians regarded the Mongols as the “Great Satan” while Source
       B confirms this negative view with a vivid description of the massacres.

     Contrasts:
     • Source B suggests that the numbers killed were extraordinarily high whereas Source D argues
       that, while the number of deaths was substantial, it has been overstated.
     • Source B suggests that the events at Nishapur and Merv were unusually barbaric whereas
       Source D, with its reference to the “atrocities and massacres” committed by Islamic states,
       suggests that they were more common.
     • Source B provides an emotive account of events describing the massacre and its aftermath,
       whereas Source D focuses on a more objective assessment of the events by referring to
       population figures in relation to the number of casualties.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, discuss the view that Mongol conquests under
     Genghis Khan were brutal and destructive?                                                          [9]

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and award
     credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
     candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
     no set answer is required. While it is expected that there will be coverage of at least two of the
     sources, candidates are not required to refer to all four sources in their responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             The source suggests that Genghis Khan was prepared to engage in diplomatic
                          negotiations. However, the delivery of gifts such as the Princess Qiguo and
                          the promise by the Emperor Xuanzong to become a vassal suggest that there
                          was sufficient fear of Genghis Khan to merit an attempt to prevent his forceful
                          acquisition of the Jin Empire.

     Source B             The source indicates that the conquests were brutal and destructive and that
                          the populations of conquered territories were mercilessly slain and their bodies
                          left in the open. However, the source also indicates that the destruction was
                          not total as not all the population suffered the same fate; some artisans were
                          spared and some children were taken into captivity. Additionally, the sparing
                          of the lives of some 400 artisans suggests that the Mongol conquests did not
                          extend to the entire destruction of cultures. Furthermore, this could suggest
                          some preplanning by Mongols to assimilate skills that may be useful in the
                          future.

Source C        This source indicates that the conquests were brutal. In addition to the human
                cost of the conquest, there was also a cultural cost as the source asserts that
                Merv, a “cultural capital”, was “razed – and never recovered”. The cultural
                vandalism suggested by the source is also linked to a search for riches: in
                addition to seizing money from the wealthiest inhabitants of the city, the
                Mongols partook of grave-robbing.

Source D        The source concedes that the Mongol conquests were brutal and destructive
                and provides some basis for an analysis of the further destruction, noting the
                events in Herat and in the Khwarezmian Empire. It also suggests that the
                impact of the conquests has been exaggerated both by contemporary and
                later historians. Therefore, it could also be suggested that the Mongols
                engaged in psychological warfare by colluding with this exaggeration.

Own knowledge   Candidates may suggest that the Mongols under Genghis Khan were not
                wantonly brutal and destructive. Further evidence of Genghis Khan’s
                willingness to accept surrender and vassalage may include the Western Xia
                dynasty (Tangut Empire). It was only when the dynasty tried to break with the
                Mongol Empire and failed to assist the Mongols in their attacks on the
                Khwarezmian Empire that it felt the full force of the Mongol attacks. This is in
                contrast to Baurchuk Art Tekin, an Uyghur chieftain, whose consistent loyalty
                to Genghis Khan led to his marriage to Khan’s daughter Alaltün.

                The Mongols under Genghis Khan practised religious toleration and did not
                seek to eradicate other faiths or their institutions, in fact, several semi-
                autonomous regions of the ‘Abbasid Empire were willing to be absorbed into
                the Mongol Empire.

                It may also be suggested that the Mongol conquests led to peace among
                warring tribes and this laid the basis for the Mongol Empire, the existence of
                which facilitated trade along the Silk Road between north and central Asia and
                Europe.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

5.   (a)   What, according to Source E, were the customs that enabled the Inquisition to identify
           Jews?                                                                                     [3]

           •   Not doing servants’ work on Saturdays.
           •   Eating food that was prepared on Friday for Saturday.
           •   Lighting candles on Friday.
           •   Eating unleavened bread.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source F suggest about the situation of the Jewish population of Spain in the
           late 15th century?                                                                      [2]

           • Jews faced hostility from the Catholic Church in Spain.
           • Military personnel were involved in the oppression of Jews.
           • Jews were faced with losing their wealth.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source G
     for an historian studying the situation of Jews and conversos during the Inquisition.            [4]

     Value:
     • The author is a professor of History, therefore the book is likely to have been well researched
       and/or, given its date of publication, may offer an overview that benefits from recent research.
     • As an academic book on the Inquisition in Spain, it offers detailed knowledge of the period.
     • The source provides an insight into the relationship between conversos, Jews and Christians.

     Limitations:
     • As a general history of the Inquisition between 1478–1614, the focus on the impact on
       conversos and Jews could be limited.
     • The sources available on the Inquisition are, for the most part, documents from the Catholic
       Church and may contain a biased view of the Jewish question in Spain during the period.
     • The data provided refers to the city council of Cuenca only, and the significant presence of
       conversos in city council positions may not be representative of the overall situation.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
     are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as supporting
     evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must be at least
     one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

     candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
     no set answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources state there were conflicts and animosity between Christians and conversos during
       the 15th century.
     • Both sources highlight that conversos accessed political and economic positions of power,
       such as in city councils and the royal court.
     • Both sources state that conversos were promoted to high positions in the Catholic Church.

     Contrasts:
     • While source G is critical of the treatment of conversos by Christians, Source H states that the
       relation between both is complex and its interpretation depends on the historical sources
       discussed.
     • Source G suggests that it is the success of some conversos in accessing positions of leadership
       that made coexistence difficult, whereas source H considers such social mobility as an example
       of successful interaction.
     • While source G views religious conversion after baptism as the main factor for social success,
       source H considers the influence of other factors such as occupation and marriage patterns.

     Indicative content

     Source E             It mentions customs and rituals that were condemned by the Inquisition. It
                          became dangerous for Jews to practise them. However, it also suggests that
                          many conversos remained faithful to Judaism.

     Source F             It clearly shows the Inquisition controlling the Jewish population. It depicts the
                          expulsion of the Jewish communities by the civil and religious authorities. It
                          shows the trauma this event represented to the Jewish population and shows
                          the economic cost of the expulsion.

     Source G             It defines the Inquisition in Spain as an institution created to fight the judaizing
                          heresy, which forced the Jews to baptise and become members of the
                          Catholic Church. However, the source mentions that despite conflicts,
                          conversos could access high positions in the social hierarchy.

     Source H             Suggests that, despite the widespread distrust and the activities of the
                          Inquisition, access to the world of commerce, finance and manufacturing was
                          open for conversos. Their access to political and religious positions of power
                          was further evidence of the opportunities available for them.

Own knowledge   Candidates might discuss the impact of the Alhambra decree of 1492, which
                forced the Jewish community to choose between baptism or expulsion. It is
                estimated that approximately 100 000 people left Spain and sought refuge in
                other kingdoms like the Netherlands and France. The Jewish community also
                lost some of their most renowned members, such as the richest and educated
                elite and several rabbis, who opted for conversion to Christianity. Candidates
                could also refer to the actions conducted by the inquisitor Tomás de
                Torquemada against the judaizer heresy. Also, many conversos suffered
                segregation because of the pure-blood status that prevented them from
                access to positions in the political hierarchy.

                Candidates could provide evidence of the limited effects of the Inquisition’s
                persecution by providing further detail regarding the levels of social and
                economic success of conversos considering that several conversos managed
                to achieve social success. They can discuss the limited success of the pure-
                blood regulations that were widely criticized and only applied in Castile. They
                can also highlight that many of the expelled men and women returned to
                Spain in the 17th century and were allowed, after baptism, to recover their
                properties.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

9.   (a)   What, according to Source J, were the challenges faced by the Nationalist [Guomindang]
           government of China as a result of the outbreak of war with Japan in 1937?             [3]

           •   Jiang Jieshi lost the opportunity to centralize power and improve the economy.
           •   The Nationalists were displaced from their traditional power base.
           •   The Nationalists were unable to crush the Communists.
           •   The resulting political instability bred fear and discontent.

     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source L suggest about relations between the Chinese Communist Party and
           the Nationalist Party [Guomindang] in 1937?                                        [2]

           • Both parties were prepared to cooperate with each other.
           • The alliance was in response to Japanese aggression.
           • An alliance between the two parties would effectively “close the door” on Japanese
             invasion.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source K
      for an historian studying political instability in China between 1931 and 1941.                  [4]

      Value:
      • Extract from a speech by the leader of the Chinese Nationalist [Guomindang] government in
        1934, contemporary to the events under study.
      • As head of the Nationalist government, Jiang Jieshi had access to government intelligence and
        information.
      • Jiang Jieshi is speaking to officers of his army. The speech shows how political instability in
        China was a great concern for the Nationalist government and the extent to which Jiang Jieshi
        considered it an obstacle in the fight against Japan.

      Limitations:
      • The fact that the speech was made in 1934 but was not released until 1937 suggests the
        Nationalist government had concerns about the information being made public at the time.
        It suggests some level of censorship or political manipulation of the speech.
      • As a speech made to officers, Jiang Jieshi may be exaggerating his worries to gain their support
        in the defence of the Nationalist government.
      • The speech, based on events up to 1934, does not provide a comprehensive account of the
        political situation in China throughout the entire period.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
      are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
      supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
      be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

      candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
      no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources identify 1937 as a turning point that ended the Nationalists’ chances to centralize
        power.
      • Both sources state that the Japanese invasion deprived the Nationalists of their control of
        industrial centres.
      • Both sources claim that the Communists were isolated in Shaanxi, a poor area.

      Contrasts:
      • Source I considers isolation in northern China compromised the Communists’ opportunities to
        succeed whereas Source J claims that it provided them with an opportunity to expand their
        influence in the region.
      • Source J claims that the armed conflict between Communists and Nationalists persisted after
        1937 whereas Source I states that they formed a united front and that only by 1941 they
        confronted one another again.
      • Source I identifies political instability in China as being caused by tensions between Nationalists
        and Communists whereas Source J considers that regional militarists were also a serious threat
        to the government.

     Indicative content

     Source I             Japanese aggression ended Jiang Jieshi’s opportunity to centralize the state.
                          It deprived the Nationalists of industries and fertile land. It also led to a period
                          of unity; however, cooperation between Nationalists and Communists was
                          nominal and ended in 1941.

     Source J             Japanese aggression weakened the Nationalists both politically and
                          economically. It provided the Communists with an opportunity to expand in
                          the North. The source identifies other factors contributing to political instability
                          in China such as political fragmentation and the influence of regional
                          militarists. The clash with Japan became a unifying force.

     Source K             Jiang Jieshi identifies disruptive groups who challenged the Nationalist
                          government, further adding to political instability. This compromised the
                          government’s chances to effectively confront Japan.

     Source L             The source shows that the Chinese Nationalist [Guomindang] and the Chinese
                          Communist Parties allied to confront Japanese aggression. It reveals the
                                       – 19 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                impact of Japanese policy on China by suggesting that, in 1937, both parties
                were prepared to compromise to prevent Japanese expansion.
Own knowledge   In their responses, candidates may refer to the effects of the Japanese
                invasion of Manchuria on Chinese politics. They may, for example, offer
                further details on Jiang Jieshi’s policy of prioritizing the fight against the
                Communists over the fight against Japan (“internal pacification before external
                resistance”). They may discuss the impact of this policy on popular support
                for both the Chinese Nationalist [Guomindang] and the Chinese Communist
                Parties. They may refer to political tensions emerging before the foundation of
                the Second United Front, such as the conflict between Jiang Jieshi and Zhang
                Xueliang, the young marshal, who believed the war against Japan should be
                prioritized over the fight against Communism. Reference to the negative
                economic impact of the Sino-Japanese War could also be relevant as it
                undermined the Guomindang and provided opportunities for the growth of
                opposition. Candidates may also discuss the ways in which the Chinese
                Communist Party defended and then liberated peasant communities from the
                Japanese.
                Candidates may also argue that political instability in China had other causes
                not linked to Japanese aggression. They could offer detail on the
                Guomindang’s failed promises of land reform and democracy for China.
                Jiang’s use of repression increased his unpopularity and furthered political
                instability. Candidates may also discuss the policies of other countries, such
                as the USSR and US, and the extent to which these contributed to furthering
                political instability in China.

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

13.   (a)   What, according to Source M, were the effects of the Selma March?                            [3]

            •   Violent encounters between protestors and state authorities.
            •   There was a sense of national outrage.
            •   Congressmen of both parties called for civil rights legislation to be put to Congress.
            •   Lyndon B Johnson was under pressure to act faster.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
      relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


      (b)   What does Source N suggest about voter registration before the Voting Rights Act
            of 1965?                                                                                     [2]

            • Voter registration rates amongst both whites and blacks varied from state to state.
            • In all states shown, the percentage of registered black voters was lower than that of white
              voters.
            • Black disenfranchisement was especially acute in Mississippi and/or black voter
              registration was highest in North Carolina.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
      Source O for an historian studying the struggle for voting rights for African-Americans during
      the 1960s?                                                                                         [4]

      Value:
      • The speech is by George Wallace, Governor of Alabama on 4 July 1964. He was an important
        political figure and he would have to implement the Civil Rights Act.
      • It provides a contemporary insight into views on civil rights reform by its opponents.
      • The emotional language of the speech demonstrates the strength of feeling regarding civil rights
        issues.

      Limitations:
      • It is a speech aimed at whipping up opposition to this Act and the strident tone adopted by
        Wallace in his speech shows how emotive such opposition could be.
      • One cannot tell how representative Wallace’s views were—it is just one man’s speech.
      • Since this speech was made in 1964, it cannot tell us the extent to which opposition to the
        implementation of the Voting Rights Act 1965 would be significant in blocking African-
        Americans’ access to the vote.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
      are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
      supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
      be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

15.   Compare and contrast what Sources O and P reveal about the attitudes of political leaders
      towards civil rights reform.                                                                      [6]

      credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
      candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
      no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources claim to advance the cause of freedom.
      • Both sources show political leaders are highly emotive in their analysis of civil rights.
      • Both sources express discontent with the current situation.

      Contrasts:
      • Source O Wallace expresses total opposition to Lyndon Johnson’s legislation because it
        represents a tyrannical attack on freedom whereas in Source P Lyndon Johnson sees his
        legislation as advancing freedom.
      • Source O’s argument is mainly based upon constitutional matters (the power of federal
        government relative to states’ rights) whereas Source P’s argument focuses upon the question
        of racial discrimination and the obstacles placed in the way of voting rights for African-
        Americans.
      • Source P claims that the purpose of the civil rights legislation is to deal with an internal
        American problem whereas Source O asserts that this legislation is part of a left-wing attempt to
        destroy human rights, and that it will lead to circumstances akin to the situation in Red China
        and the Soviet Union.

16.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, discuss the reasons why legislation, including the
      Civil Rights Act of 1964, had not been effective in helping African-Americans to gain full voting

      Indicative content

      Source M             This source shows that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not effective because
                           of the official and brutal state response in Alabama to the African-Americans’
                           attempt to exercise civil rights. It was this outrage that gave further impetus to
                           the push for a federal voting rights bill.

      Source N             The source demonstrates that despite legislation, the percentage of African-
                           American voters in the southern states (particularly in Mississippi and
                           Alabama) was low and further progress was necessary.

      Source O             Wallace’s speech in July 1964 shows how federal intervention in favour of
                           African-Americans’ civil rights was opposed on the grounds of states’ rights
                           and “democracy”. It reveals the strong opposition against the Act posed by
                           state government authorities such as Governor Wallace. This speech makes
                           it clear that the Civil Rights Act 1964 would not be effective in ensuring voting
                           rights for African-Americans.

Source P        This speech by Lyndon Johnson in 1965 was in reaction to the violent racist
                opposition to the Selma Marchers’ demand for African-American voting rights.
                The source describes the various stratagems still being applied in 1965
                (one year after the passage of the 1964 Act) in order to deny the vote to
                African-Americans. It shows there were racial barriers preventing the effective
                application of the legislation.

Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that civil rights legislation was largely ineffective
                because of the unwillingness of state authorities to enforce any legislation.
                It was also a fact that most African-Americans did not have the political and
                economic influence to assert their rights. Candidates may refer to the Civil
                Rights Act 1957, which intended to ensure voting rights for African-Americans
                but was, in practice, ineffective because the sanctions against those opposing
                such rights were too feeble. The Civil Rights Act 1960 required local
                authorities to keep records of voter registration. However, these two Acts had
                minimal effect—by 1963 only 200 000 of the South’s 20 million African-
                American citizens were registered to vote. Also, both the 1957 and the 1960
                Acts encountered filibuster tactics in the US Senate, for example, in 1957
                Senator James Thurmond opposed the Act in a speech which lasted 24 hours
                and 18 minutes. The Mississippi Freedom Riders’ campaign to secure voter
                registration for African-Americans in the summer of 1964 had limited success
                due to violence it encountered from the state police and the Ku Klux Klan
                (for example, three civil rights workers were murdered in Mississippi).
                The focus of the Civil Rights Act was upon the desegregation of any facility
                or public place and upon fair access to employment, rather than upon voting
                rights.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

17.   (a)   What, according to Source Q, were the reasons why so many people took part in the
            violence in Rwanda?                                                                       [3]

            •   People were forced to join the killers.
            •   There was social pressure to participate in the violence.
            •   There was a struggle over land ownership.
            •   Some people argue that it was due to “long-simmering resentment” between Hutu and
                Tutsi.

            • Places of worship were not exempt from the violence.
            • Substantial numbers were killed.
            • The blood-stained material suggests the attacks were especially brutal.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source Q
      for an historian studying the reasons why people participated in the Rwandan genocide.           [4]

      Value:
      • The source is a newspaper article from The New York Times in August 1994 based on
        interviews with people directly involved in the violence only a few months earlier. It is a
        respected newspaper and its author won an award for his coverage of the events.
      • The source conveys to US readers, and the wider world, the extent of the violence in Rwanda
        and it explains why the violence happened.
      • The testimonies of the teacher and Christian minister give clear reasons why they had to
        participate in the violence.

      Limitations:
      • The source was published in August 1994 and may be deemed to be too close to the actual
        events in April and May to really offer a full explanation of why the violence occurred.
      • The source is by a journalist and not an historian, and while the journalist may be award
        winning, the material may be written to interest a wider audience.
      • The people interviewed by the journalist may be trying to justify or excuse their participation in
        the violence.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the question. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used
      as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there
      must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

      candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
      no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources claim that the massacres were organized affairs. Source R claims that the
        violence was not carried out by “death squads”, but by ordinary people guided by armed militia
        and trained infantrymen and Source S explains that the Tutsi people were “rounded up” by the
        Gendarmerie and taken to the church before civilian militiamen killed them.
      • Both sources identify churches as places where massacres took place.
      • Both sources explain the importance of identity cards in the discrimination and violence against
        the Tutsi.

      Contrasts:
      • Source R claims that the Church was an active participant in the killing and that priests were
        divided between those who were victims and those who participated in the violence whereas
        Source S implies that the priests were held captive during the massacre.
      • Source R indicates that ordinary people such as doctors and teachers sometimes acted
        independently whereas Source S stresses the massacre was not “a spontaneous act” and
        identifies the role of organized groups in it.
      • Source S focuses only on the massacres whereas Source R suggests that discrimination took
        other forms including denunciations by teachers and some doctors’ refusal to treat Tutsis.

20.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with the statement
      in Source Q that “It was not random violence that engulfed” Rwanda in 1994?                        [9]

      Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and award
      credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
      candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
      no set answer is required. While it is expected that there will be coverage of at least two of the
      sources, candidates are not required to refer to all four sources in their responses.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             This source emphasises that ordinary people like Mr Micomyiza and
                           Mr Ndutiye were coerced into joining the killers to save their own lives. Mobs
                           roamed the towns and pressurised people to join them. The source shows the
                           existence of long-lasting resentment.

      Source R             This source claims that although the killing was done by ordinary people they
                           were guided by armed militia and trained infantrymen. This implies that the
                           killing was highly organized. However, later in the source the author does
                           identify several independent acts of violence and persecution such as
                           teachers taking it upon themselves to kill Tutsis, and some doctors refusing to
                           treat them.

      Source S             Source S indicates that the violence was not spontaneous, but rather the
                           result of coordination between several official groups such as “the army
                           Gendarmerie, Interahamwe, and the civil service.”

Source T        Candidates may infer from the heaps of clothing depicted in this source that
                the killings were brutal and took place on a significant scale. They could also,
                or alternatively, argue that because the killings took place in a church that the
                violence was random and out of control.

Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to long standing issues between the Hutu and Tutsi to
                show that the genocide was not “random violence”. For example, they could
                refer to historical rivalries and the discrimination against Hutus. Habyarimana
                formed the National Republican Movement for Development (NRMD), and its
                youth wing, Interahamwe, later became a Hutu Power militia group. They
                could discuss the role of exiled Tutsis in forming the Rwandan Patriotic Front
                (RPF) that invaded Rwanda in 1990 and resulted in the outbreak of civil war.
                Candidates may also discuss the significance of anti-Tutsi propaganda, like
                The Hutu Ten Commandments, Kangura and RTLM [Radio Télévision Libres
                des Milles Collines]. There is also evidence that Dallaire foresaw an impeding
                genocide, which indicates some planning. Candidates could argue that the
                assassination of President Habyarimana on 6 April 1994 precipitated a
                political crisis, which led to the killing of Tutsis and moderate Hutus by the
                Rwandan Army, the Interahamwe and other Hutu Power militia groups.
