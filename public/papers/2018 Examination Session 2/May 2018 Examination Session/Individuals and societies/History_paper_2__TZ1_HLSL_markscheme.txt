Markbands for paper 2

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
 10–12     The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
 7–9       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
           historical context.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant. The response makes links
           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
 4–6       The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
           understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
 1–3       There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   To what extent did social structures and systems in two societies change significantly?

     Candidates will consider the extent to which social structures and societies changed in two
     medieval societies. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic,
     the two societies need not be contemporaneous with each other. Further, the two societies may or
     may not be chosen from different regions. The extent of change may be measured by considering
     not only the ways in which societies changed but also aspects of continuity, in relation to, for
     example, the role of women, changes in class structure and social hierarchy, assimilation of
     migrant populations, patterns of landholdings and obligations or the transition from migrant to
     permanent settlement. The impact of the rise of towns and cities may be considered. Each
     society may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted.


2.   “The support of rulers was the main factor enabling the spread of religion.” With reference to two
     societies, each from a different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the hypothesis in relation to two societies,
     although the number of rulers is not specified. While the focus of the response must be within the
     timeframe of this topic, the two societies need not be contemporaneous with each other. However,
     the two societies must come from different regions. Candidates may choose, for example, to
     consider societies where political power was closely linked to, or supported by, religion; there may
     be examples of the spread of religion through conquest or as a result of natural disasters.
     Candidates may choose to weigh the importance of rulers’ support, or lack thereof, against other
     factors. Each society may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted if
     candidates wish to compare the importance of rulers’ support to the spread of religion.
                                                 –7–                 M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   Compare and contrast the causes of two medieval wars.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the causes of two wars,
     referring to both wars throughout. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of
     this topic, the two wars need not have occurred at the same time but they may or may not be
     chosen from a different region. Causes to be considered might include, but are not limited to,
     territorial disputes, disputed succession, a power vacuum created by the decline of a state/empire
     or religious or economic causes. Candidates may choose to show how causes interact, or how
     stated motives may disguise underlying factors. Comparison and contrast may be achieved by
     weighing the different types of cause.


4.   Evaluate the importance of women in two medieval wars.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of women in two wars. While the focus of the
     response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars need not have occurred at the
     same time but they may or may not be chosen from the same region. Candidates may evaluate
     the role of individual women or, alternatively, choose to evaluate the role of women in general.
     They may, for example, evaluate women’s military role as warriors or leaders, or their roles in
     replacing or supporting absent men, perhaps as regents or managers of estates. Importance may
     be gauged by their impact on the outcomes of wars or their value in enabling men to fight and
     supporting them at war. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted.
                                                   –8–                  M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Compare and contrast the methods used by two medieval rulers to expand their power.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the methods used by
     two medieval rulers to expand their power, referring to both rulers throughout. While the focus of
     the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two rulers need not have been
     contemporaries and they may or may not be chosen from a different region. Methods under
     scrutiny could include the exploitation of lineage or marriage, claims to religious or divine support,
     opportunistic exploitation of neighbours’ weakness or division, exploration or commercial
     expansion. To achieve comparison or contrast, methods must be assessed rather than merely
     described.


6.   “Medieval rulers were mostly successful in overcoming the challenges posed by rebellion and/or
     political opposition.” Discuss with reference to two medieval rulers.

     With reference to two rulers, candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the
     hypothesis that rulers were mostly successful in overcoming the challenges posed by rebellion
     and/or political opposition. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this
     topic, the two rulers need not be contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from a
     different region. The focus of the answer will be on the extent to which challenges were overcome,
     rather than on the methods used. Therefore, candidates may consider, for example, whether
     rebels’/opponents’ aims were mostly thwarted, whether the defeat of opposition was temporary or
     longer-lasting, or whether there were political compromises, or conversely, concentration of power.
     Consideration of foreign opposition is valid.
                                                  –9–                 M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in Transition (1400–1700)

7.   “The social and economic treatment of minorities in early modern societies was severe.”
     Discuss with reference to one early modern society.

     With reference to one early modern society, candidates will offer a considered and balanced
     review of the hypothesis that social and economic treatment of minorities (the treatment of women
     is not valid) in early modern societies was unfair. The focus of the response must be within the
     timeframe of the topic, but the answer need not cover the whole timeframe; neither is it necessary
     for the social and economic aspects of the hypothesis to be equally treated. Candidates may, for
     example, consider the fairness or otherwise of political, commercial and tax privileges enjoyed by
     some minorities, religiously based discrimination (sometimes particularly acute in war-time), or the
     treatment of slaves who may have come from a minority group.


8.   Discuss the impact on society and culture of two intellectual movements.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the impact on society and culture of two
     intellectual movements, which, while not needing to be contemporaneous with each other, must fall
     within the timeframe of the topic. The examples chosen may or may not come from different
     regions, and candidates may discuss the impact on states, regions, or geographical areas. It is not
     necessary to treat society and culture equally. Candidates may, for example, refer to changes in
     art, literature, scientific discoveries and exploration, religion and education. Discussion of the
     relationship between a cultural movement and social or political discontent would be valid.
     Candidates will go beyond description of movements to focus on impact. Each intellectual
     movement may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted to compare the impact
     on society or culture.
                                                 – 10 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 5: Early modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Compare and contrast the nature of power and rule in one state in ascendancy and one state in
      decline.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the nature of power and
      rule in one state in ascendancy and one in decline, referring to both states throughout. While the
      focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the chosen states do not need to
      have existed at the same time. They may or may not come from the same region. Candidates
      may, for example, consider the role of economic and financial structures, factors which contributed
      to social discontent, or, conversely, cohesion, or the roles of religion or war. The relationship
      between local and central authority may be considered.


10.   To what extent were political reasons the driving force in the expansion of two colonial empires?

      Candidates will consider the extent to which political motives were the most significant reason for
      the expansion of two colonial empires. The colonial empires may or may not come from the same
      region and may cross regions. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of
      this topic, the chosen empires do not need to be contemporaneous with each other. Each empire
      may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used. While the prime focus will be
      on political motives, other motives may be considered for comparison. Candidates may consider,
      for example, the linkage between colonial expansion and a state’s power and prestige and/or a
      ruler’s ambition. Non-political motives could be economic, such as the need to control a resource
      or a trade route. A variety of approaches is possible.
                                                 – 11 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of early modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the importance of foreign influence and/or involvement in the outcome of two
      early modern wars.

      Candidates will appraise the importance of foreign involvement in the outcome of two early modern
      wars chosen from the timeframe of the topic. The wars chosen do not need to have occurred at
      the same time and they may or may not come from different regions. Each war may be considered
      separately, or a thematic approach may be adopted. Foreign involvement may, for example, have
      come directly from sovereign powers, or been in the form of mercenary troops or diplomatic
      support. Candidates will ensure that evaluation of foreign involvement is linked to outcomes of the
      chosen wars. In some cases, foreign involvement may not have secured victory; in others,
      candidates may consider whether victory could have been achieved without it. In evaluating
      importance, candidates may compare the importance of other factors, which may be economic,
      geographical, tactical or strategic.


12.   “The effects of peacemaking were more positive than negative.” Discuss with reference to
      peacemaking after two early modern wars.

      With reference to two wars, candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the
      hypothesis that the effects of peacemaking were more positive than negative. While the focus of
      the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars need not have occurred at
      the same time. Depending on the wars chosen, the candidates’ analysis of the effects of
      peacemaking may extend beyond 1750 in cases, for example, where long-lasting peace was
      achieved or where conflict continued for many years. In this way, events that occurred outside of
      the topic timeframe may be considered relevant. Candidates may discuss positive and negative
      effects for the warring powers themselves or for their region or locality. The effects may have
      been, for example, diplomatic, territorial or commercial. The peacemaking effort after each war
      may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted.
                                                  – 12 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate the significance of mass production in two countries, each from a different region.

      Candidates will appraise the significance of mass production in two countries, which must come
      from different regions. “Mass production” refers to the production or manufacture of standardized
      goods in large quantities, especially by machinery. While the focus of the response must be within
      the timeframe of this topic, the two examples chosen do not need to be contemporaneous with
      each other. Candidates may evaluate the significance of mass production throughout the
      timeframe, or they may choose a narrower period. Each country may be considered separately or
      a thematic approach may be adopted. Candidates may, for example, evaluate the impact of mass
      production on the cost of goods, employment patterns, transport, living standards, social structure
      and labour conditions. There may also have been political consequences, such as the emergence
      of new parties and trade unions. The internationalization of mass production may have enabled
      the emergence of new economies in the developing world.


14.   Discuss the impact of industrialization on labour conditions in two countries.

      Candidates must offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of industrialization on
      labour conditions in two countries. The chosen countries may or may not come from the same
      region. Each country may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted.
      When addressing “labour conditions” candidates may refer to job security, remuneration, working
      hours, physical conditions, and safety. The period of industrialization to be discussed may vary in
      length according to the examples chosen, and may focus on the early stages of industrialization,
      which may have occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries or much more recently, or on more mature
      economies and societies. The impact may be either positive or negative. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the process of industrialization in the two
      states chosen need not have occurred simultaneously.
                                                  – 13 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Compare and contrast the importance of nationalism to two independence movements, each from
      a different region.

      Candidates will give an account of how similar and different the importance of nationalism was in
      two independence movements referring to both movements throughout. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two movements chosen need not be
      contemporaneous with each other. They may compare the spread of nationalist ideas among
      different social groups, different ideologies that promoted independence and nationalism’s role in
      promoting insurrection. They may weigh the roles of other factors such as the economic policies of
      colonial powers or international intervention. It would be valid to consider the response of colonial
      powers to the growth of nationalism, which may have further provoked nationalist insurrection or,
      conversely, eased the passage to independence.


16.   “Successful independence movements were dependent on skillful and persuasive leaders.”
      Discuss with reference to two independence movements.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypotheses that successful
      independence movements were dependent on skillful and persuasive leaders. While the focus of
      the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the movements chosen need not have
      occurred simultaneously, nor need they come from the same region. The movements may be
      considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted. Candidates must discuss the
      importance of the leader to the success of the independence movement and focus on their skill
      and persuasiveness, possibly through discussion of the methods used to generate support from
      diverse social groups, their military strategy, their charisma, or motivational speeches. The focus
      of the question is on the leader’s role; however, candidates may weigh the importance of the
      leader against other factors that contributed to the movement’s success, such as economic
      conditions or international support.

Topic 9: Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   “Greater equality in democratic states was the result of pressure from suffrage movements.”
      Discuss with reference to two democratic states, each from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that greater equality was
      the result of pressure from suffrage movements in democratic states. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be
      contemporaneous with each other, but they must come from different regions. “Suffrage
      Movements” refers to organized action to provide a disenfranchised group with the right to vote.
      Such groups may, for example, include women, religious minorities, indigenous peoples, the poor
      and the uneducated. Candidates will discuss the linkage between extension of the vote and
      political, social and/or economic equality. It would be valid to choose examples where no such
      progress had taken place, or where extension of the vote was not due to suffrage movements.
      The examples may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted.


18.   Evaluate the impact of democracy on social policies in two democratic states.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of democracy on social policies in two democratic
      states, which may or may not be from the same region. While the focus of response must be
      within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be contemporaneous with each
      other. Candidates may consider the extent of change in the educational system after the
      establishment, or during the evolution, of democracy. They may address social welfare policies
      and/or policies towards women and minorities. There may be some crossover into socio-economic
      policies in candidates’ responses. The examples may be considered separately or a thematic
      approach may be adopted.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   Compare and contrast the importance of propaganda to the emergence of two authoritarian states.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the importance of
      propaganda in the emergence of two authoritarian states referring to both throughout. While the
      focus of response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be
      contemporaneous with each other, nor need they be from the same region. Candidates will focus
      on authoritarian states during their emergence, rather than after the leaders obtained power.
      Rather than describe propaganda in both cases, candidates will explain its importance to the
      emergence of the authoritarian states. Candidates may gauge the importance of propaganda by
      comparing its role with other factors, such as economic distress, leaders’ charisma or the collapse
      of the existing government.


20.   “The domestic policies of authoritarian states rarely benefitted women.” Discuss with reference to
      two authoritarian states.

      Candidates will give a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that the domestic policies
      of authoritarian states rarely benefited women. While the focus of the response must be within the
      timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be contemporaneous with each other. The
      states may or may not come from different regions. Candidates may refer to the condition of
      women before authoritarianism was established, and discuss the extent of benefit or otherwise,
      promoted by the policies of the authoritarian state. Candidates may, for example, discuss legal,
      social and economic equality, or the extent of female involvement in local and national politics.
      Familial relations, access to education and child care, and differences between social groups may
      also be discussed. The states may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be
      adopted.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   Evaluate the importance of guerrilla warfare to the outcome of two 20th-century wars.

      Candidates will appraise the importance of guerrilla warfare to the outcome of two 20th century
      wars, which may or may not come from the same region. While the focus of the response must be
      within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be contemporaneous with each
      other. Candidates will ensure that evaluation of guerrilla warfare is linked to outcomes of the
      chosen wars. It would be valid to weigh the contribution of guerrilla warfare against other factors
      that determined the wars’ outcome. It could also be valid to choose wars where guerrilla warfare
      had limited impact on the outcome; however, candidates must, in this case, address the reasons
      why guerrilla warfare was less significant. The wars may be considered separately or a thematic
      approach may be adopted.


22.   With reference to one 20th-century war, compare and contrast the political repercussions for two
      countries.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and difference between the political
      repercussions of one war for two countries, referring to both countries throughout. The chosen
      countries may or may not come from the same region. Depending on the war chosen, the
      candidates’ analysis of political repercussions may extend beyond 2000. In this way, events which
      occurred in the first eight years (in line with the 10-year rule) of the 21st century may be considered
      relevant. Candidates may, for example, consider territorial changes, countries where wars created
      political instability or regime change, countries where a political leader’s prestige was enhanced, or
      countries where the experience of war promoted isolationism or, conversely, a determination to
      prevent future conflict.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “Ideology was the main factor that led to the emergence of superpower rivalry between 1943 and
      1949.” Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that ideology
      was the main factor that led to the emergence of superpower rivalry between 1943 and 1949.
      They may weigh ideology against other factors, but the role of ideological causes must be
      addressed. It may be valid to mention events before 1943 that had an impact lasting into the time
      period in question. However, candidates must not stray beyond 1949. Candidates may explain
      the ideological differences between the US and the USSR, but will link them to the emergence of
      superpower rivalry. They may also discuss the interaction of ideological and strategic factors,
      especially in respect of eastern Europe. Other factors for consideration may include the atomic
      bomb, the Marshall Plan and the role of personalities.


24.   Compare and contrast the causes of two Cold War crises, each from a different region.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the causes of two Cold
      War crises referring to both crises throughout. While some of the countries may be involved in
      both crises, or may be from the same region, the crises themselves must be from different regions.
      While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of the topic, the two crises need not
      be contemporaneous with each other. Causes which candidates may consider could include, but
      are not confined to, the Soviet need to protect or extend its sphere of influence, US attempts to
      prevent the spread of communism and/or respond to perceived threats, and superpower
      competition in Africa and the Middle East.
