1.   (a)       Explain two reasons why a government might want to subsidize a good or service.   [10]

               Answers may include:
                definition of subsidy
                diagram to show the effect of a subsidy on a good or service
                explanation that governments might introduce a subsidy for different
                 reasons, to correct externalities, to protect domestic industry
                example(s) of goods and services that governments subsidize and the
                 reasons for doing so.

(b)   Discuss the view that governments should tax the consumption of gasoline
      (petroleum).                                                                        [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of indirect tax if not given in part (a)
       diagram of negative externalities in the consumption of gasoline
       explanation that governments have a number of reasons why they might

        externalities of consumption
       example(s) of where governments have taxed (or subsidized) gasoline
       synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of reasons against (impact on business
      costs, impact on low income car owners), for example, some governments could
      subsidize it.

      N.B.: It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.

(b)   Discuss whether price will always be lower and output will always be higher in
      perfect competition compared to monopoly.                                               [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of perfect competition, monopoly, price and output
       diagrams to compare long-run equilibrium in perfect competition and monopoly
       explanation of how in perfect competition the characteristics of the market lead to
        normal profit and economic efficiency and consequently lower prices and a higher
        output than a less efficient market like monopoly
       examples of perfect competition and monopoly

      Discussion may include: the benefits of monopoly like economies of scale, which
      could lead to lower prices and higher output.

(b)   Evaluate government policies to deal with the different types of unemployment.           [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of government policies and frictional, structural, seasonal and cyclical
        (demand-deficient) unemployment
       diagrams might include AD/AS showing how government policies can increase
        AD leading to an increase in real GDP and/or a diagram to show how an increase
        in AD can reduce structural unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment
       explanation that fiscal, monetary or supply-side policies can all be used to reduce
        the different types of unemployment. Outlining the transmission mechanism
        involved
       examples of situations where a country has reduced a type of unemployment
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Examination may include: the effectiveness of fiscal, monetary and supply-side
      policies in terms of dealing with the different types of unemployment including the
      limitations of using demand management to deal with anything other than cyclical
      unemployment and the suitability of various supply-side policies. In addition, the
      short-run/long-run implications of using demand management and supply-side
      policies may be evaluated.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.

4.   (a)       Explain how expansionary fiscal policy could be used to close a deflationary
               (recessionary) gap.                                                                       [10]

               Answers may include:

                 gap

(b)   Evaluate the view that fiscal policy is the most effective way of achieving long-term
      economic growth.                                                                        [15]

       definition of long-term economic growth
       diagram to show a shift in the PPC and potential output. An AD/AS diagram
        showing a shift of LRAS to the right.
       explanation of how fiscal policy leads to long-term economic growth indirectly by
        creating an economic environment that is favourable to private investment,
        and directly through government spending on physical capital goods and human
        capital formation, as well as provision of incentives for firms to invest
       examples of fiscal policy that has had this effect
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the type of fiscal policy and how it is financed, advantages
      and disadvantages of fiscal policy, consideration of alternative policies, such as
      monetary and supply-side policies.
      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.
