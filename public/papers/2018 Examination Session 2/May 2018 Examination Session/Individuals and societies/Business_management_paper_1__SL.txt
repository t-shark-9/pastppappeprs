                                             Section A

Answer two questions from this section.

1.   (a)   With reference to Table 2, describe two advantages for Su of using a cash-flow
           forecast.                                                                                 [4]

     (b)   With reference to Su and her managers at HH and AS, explain the differences between
           leadership and management.                                                                [6]



2.   (a)   With reference to AK Bank, describe two features of for-profit microfinance providers.    [4]

     (b)   Su is considering two possible locations for the production facility (lines 51–52).
           Explain the factors (reasons) that Su may consider when deciding between the two
           locations.                                                                                [6]


3.   (a)   Describe two advantages for AS of using cellular manufacturing in the production of its
           solar power systems.                                                                      [4]

     (b)   Explain the advantages for Su of forming AS as a private limited company.                 [6]

                                                  Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   It is now mid-2019. Production of solar power systems has been going for over a year. Sales
     have exceeded forecasts and reached 5000 systems for the year. All profits have been reinvested
     into developing a portable biomass source of electricity* (PBS) as an alternative to solar power
     systems.

     The PBS technology is now fully developed and tested. Su has data to help her decide whether to
     go into production. The new production facility will cost $1 million.

     The costs and the price of the product once production has begun are estimated in Table 3.

                            Table 3: Estimated cost and price data for PBS

                                   Fixed costs           $200 000 per year

                                   Variable costs        $70 per PBS

                                   Likely price          $90 per PBS


     In a separate development, Doorway Foundation (DF), a multibillion-dollar charity established by
     the owners of one of the world’s largest IT businesses, has approached Su. The foundation has
     a major IT initiative to bring IT to schools in Afghanistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh. By forming a
     joint venture, DF could use AS’s expertise and local knowledge to help solve some of the electricity
     supply and IT problems in Afghanistan. DF would have majority ownership in the joint venture,
     provide most of the senior managers, and is likely to expect changes in the way AS operates.
     AS would have to significantly increase the production of solar power systems and would have
     to restructure. Some managers may lose influence over decisions. Su is worried that her
     Afghanistan project (AS) would take second place. However, she sees this as a huge opportunity
     to make a real change in young people’s lives.

* portable biomass source of electricity: a means of generating electricity using the
  heat obtained from burning plant material and/or animal waste


     (a)   Define two characteristics of a charity.                                                    [2]

     (b)   (i)    Using the information in Table 3, calculate the break-even output for portable
                  biomass sources of electricity (show all your working).                              [2]

           (ii)   Comment on the usefulness to AS of break-even analysis.                              [6]

     (c)   Recommend whether AS should enter into a joint venture with DF.                            [10]
