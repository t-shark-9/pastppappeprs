Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools
of thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic
illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Evaluate the claim that for anthropology to be relevant today, it must take a universalistic rather
     than a particularistic perspective.


2.   Examine the relationship between structure-centred and agency-centred perspectives in the work
     of one anthropologist.


3.   Compare two of the following schools of thought in relation to either a materialist or an idealist
     perspective:
        Marxism
        feminism
        symbolic theories
        structuralism.


4.   Discuss ways in which either a synchronic perspective or a diachronic perspective would
     contribute to the understanding of one of the following:
      ethnic relations
      inequality
      ritual.


5.   Examine either a conflict-centred perspective or a cohesion-centred perspective with reference to
     two schools of thought.
