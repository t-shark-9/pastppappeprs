Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           • Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to support the
              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate
              and relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9      • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
           • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
              historical context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.
           • The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical
              commentary, but this is not sustained.
  4–6      • The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While
              there may be an attempt to follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and
              coherence.
           • Knowledge is demonstrated but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
              understanding of historical context. The answer makes use of specific examples,
              although these may be vague or lack relevance.
           • There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in
              nature, rather than analytical.
                                            –6–                 M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


1–3   • There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response is poorly
        structured or, where there is a recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on
        the task.
      • Little knowledge is present. Where specific examples are referred to, they are factually
        incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
      • The response contains little or no critical analysis. It may consist mostly of
        generalizations and poorly substantiated assertions.
 0    • Response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   “While there was significant political development during the first century of ‘Abbasid rule, there
     was little economic development.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that there
     was little economic development compared to political development during the first century of
     ‘Abbasid rule. Candidates may offer equal coverage of political development and economic
     development, or they may prioritize their assessment of one. However, both aspects will be a
     feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the impact of the move of the capital city from
     Damascus to Baghdad, the appointment of al-Mansur’s family members to administrative positions,
     the role played by the Caliphs, the tax system, and the impact on trade among other factors. While
     other relevant factors, for example social development, may be referred to, the bulk of the
     response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
     disagree with the statement.


2.   “Al-Ma’mun was an effective ruler.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that al-
     Ma’mun was an effective ruler. Candidates may refer to the military achievements of his rule,
     which contributed to important triumphs against the Byzantine Empire, as well as successful
     campaigns against Sicily and Palermo. In addition to this, candidates may consider cultural
     developments—such as those relating to astronomy, cartography, theology and rationalism—or
     and religious developments. There may also be some analysis of the factors that contributed to
     opposition and riots during his reign. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     statement.
                                                 –8–                 M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   “The Fatimids had a significant impact on the development of trade during the period from 909 to
     1171.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that during the period in question, the development of trade was affected significantly by the
     Fatimids. Candidates may refer to the economic policies of the Fatimids and/or they may engage
     in a discussion of how Egypt became the centre of a vast empire that stretched between the
     Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. At its heart was Cairo, which was thus elevated to a key
     centre of trade between the two regions. While other relevant factors, for example other groups’
     trading enterprises, may be referenced to provide context, the bulk of the response will remain on
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     statement.


4.   Discuss the reasons for the decline of the Fatimids.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
     the Fatimids went into decline. Candidates may refer to the impact of the rule of al-Hakim (996–
     1021) which was a critical period in that he pursued an aggressive policy of persecution of
     Christians and Jews that led to growing opposition to his authority. The power of the caliphs was
     also challenged by military officers who became semi-independent at the frontiers of the empire
     when charged with the collection of taxes and the protection of lands. The development and
     significance of conflict within the army, or the impact—in the 11th century—of the decision of the
     Zirids (the Berber governors of North Africa) to declare independence from the Fatimids in favour
     of recognizing the Sunni ‘Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad may also be discussed as reasons for the
     decline of the Fatimids.
                                                 –9–                 M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   “Religion was the main reason for the foundation of the crusader states.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     crusader states were founded mainly because of religious factors. Reasons may predate the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the aims of the First Crusade and the crusaders more broadly as well as the relationship
     between Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe. While other relevant factors—for example
     political and economic motivations, as well as the broader process of European expansion that
     witnessed the migration of many people in search of land and commercial opportunities—may be
     referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


6.   “Salah al-Din (Saladin) made the most significant contribution to Muslim success during the period
     of the Crusades.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that Muslim success during the period of the Crusades was significantly aided by the contributions
     of Salah al-Din. Candidates may refer to the capture of almost the entire kingdom of Jerusalem
     and most of the Crusader cities under the direction of Salah al-Din as well as his triumph over the
     Christian armies at Hattin in 1187. While other relevant factors, for example the impact made by
     other Muslim leaders or the failing of the Crusaders themselves may be referred to, the bulk of the
     response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
     disagree with the statement.
                                                 – 10 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   “Administrative efficiency was the major factor in the success of the Ottoman Empire.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the success of the Ottoman Empire was largely a consequence of the empire’s administrative
     efficiency. Candidates may refer to the hierarchical and bureaucratic system that was employed
     throughout the empire and the centralization of many aspects of the state system. While other
     relevant factors, for example the powerful army, the devshirme system, economic prosperity, the
     unifying impact of Islam and the importance of having a single leader, may be referred to, the bulk
     of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly
     agree or disagree with the statement.


8.   To what extent did the fall of Constantinople (1453) transform the Ottoman Empire?

     The question requires that candidates consider the impact of the fall of Constantinople on the
     Ottoman Empire. Candidates may refer to the prestige that the city offered to the Ottomans as well
     as the city’s strategic significance as a gateway to Europe. The city had been a target for the
     Ottomans for some time and its seizure may have been perceived as a breakthrough. In addition
     to this, the Constantinople offered the Ottomans new economic opportunities, as the city was a
     major centre of trade in the Mediterranean. While other relevant factors, for example the role of
     leaders may be assessed as having a more significant impact, the bulk of the response will remain
     on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     suggestion.

Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    Evaluate the role of trade in the Islamization of East and West Africa.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Islamization of East and West
      Africa, weighing up the importance or otherwise of the role of trade. Candidates may refer to the
      impact of merchants in spreading ideas across the most important trading routes of the two regions
      and they may suggest the impact was stronger in one are than it was in the other. Both
      importance and limitations of the role of trade must be clearly indicated but there does not need to
      be an equal focus on each. While other relevant factors, for example the impact of scholarship,
      may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


10.   Evaluate the reasons for the rise and expansion of the Kingdom of the Kongo to 1600.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the rise of the Kingdom of the Kongo
      up to 1600, weighing up the reasons for both its rise and its expansion. Candidates may refer to
      the arrival of Bantu-speaking people who became firmly established in the savannah region near
      Kongo (in modern-day Angola). Their cultivation of the land and conquest of the San people
      facilitated the development of a complex social and political system. The geography of this region
      also contributed to its success. Other factors that may be addressed include the importance of
      trade in ivory, cloth and pottery, copper smelting, its commercially strategic position and the impact
      of leaders including Mbokani Mavinga who expanded the kingdom to encompass, among other
      areas, the neighbouring state of Loango.

Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   Discuss the reasons for the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the Sokoto Caliphate rose to power. Candidates may discuss the development within the Fulani
      community of an Islamic clerical group that influenced the leaders of several regional Jihad
      movements. They may also emphasize the importance of Usman Dan Fodio, who became a
      revered religious thinker and who criticized the Fulanis’ Hausa rulers for combining Islam with
      traditional African practices. The Hausa emir’s restrictions on trade, their over-taxation of Fulani
      pastoralists and Hausa peasantry were also causes for discontent. When unrest broke out
      between Usman Dan Fodio’s supporters and the Hausa in 1804, he fled and proclaimed a new
      Islamic state. By 1808 this new state had begun the process of conquering the Hausa; a task that
      was completed in 1812. After this, Usman Dan Fodio was able to assert that he was the ruler of
      the largest state in Africa, the new Fulani Empire. Other relevant factors, for example social and
      political issues, may also be addressed to contextualize candidates’ analyses of the rise of the
      caliphate.


12.   Evaluate the role of political organization in the rise of two of the following: the Mandinka empire;
      the Lozi kingdom; the Ndebele kingdom; the Asante empire; Unyamwezi; the Hehe state.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the rise of two of the named entities,
      weighing up the importance or otherwise of political organization to this rise. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of their choices or they may emphasize the impact of political organization in one
      over the other. However, both will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or
      may not be used. Candidates may consider the type of political organization that existed, be it
      tribe, confederation or kingdom and they may consider the role played by different types of leader,
      be they religious or political leaders. While the impact of political organization will vary from state
      to state, and candidates can draw upon other factors—such as a strong economy and flourishing
      trade—to contextualize their responses, the bulk of the answer will remain on the issue raised in
      the question.

Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   Discuss the reasons for the expansion of the East African slave trade from the late 18th century.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the East African slave trade expanded from the late 18th century. Candidates may refer to social,
      economic, political, short-term and long-term factors. They may argue that the slave trade in East
      Africa was an expansion of the traditional slave trade and was facilitated by the existence of trade
      routes and growing demands for trade in a range of items. Traditional warfare in East Africa may
      also be noted as a cause; it meant that prisoners of war could be sold as slaves and that there was
      a plentiful supply of such prisoners. The developing trade links between the coasts of east Africa
      and Arabia also contributed to the growing demand for slaves. The 1807 British ban on the slave
      trader and its enforcement in the Atlantic may also be discussed, as may the impact of the Sultans
      of Zanzibar.


14.   “The abolitionist movement was the major factor in the decline of the Atlantic Slave trade.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the decline of the Atlantic Slave trade was largely caused by the abolitionist movement.
      Candidates may refer to the role played by abolitionists such as Wilberforce, Clarkson and Sharpe
      and the impact of anti-slavery protests in countries such as Britain may also be addressed. The
      British Abolition of Slavery Act (1833) aimed to bring the slave trade to an end in most parts of the
      British Empire and this had an impact on the Atlantic slave trade. While other relevant factors, for
      example economic developments that reduced reliance on slave plantations in the West Indies and
      the Berlin Act (1885), which agreed that all nations involved in the scramble for Africa would assist
      in the suppression of slavery, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   To what extent was the decline of the Ottoman Empire the most significant reason for the growth of
      European activity in Africa?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      growth of European activity in Africa was largely caused by the decline of the Ottoman Empire.
      Candidates may refer to factors such as problems in the Ottoman Empire (the “sick man of
      Europe”), which left the region susceptible to European expansionary aims and facilitated
      European colonization of North Africa. There may be reference to the achievement of autonomy in
      Egypt under Muhammad Ali and growing Anglo-French interests for strategic and economic
      reasons. These led to the British occupation of Egypt in 1882. While other relevant factors, for
      example the role of traders in east, west and south Africa and the impact of missionary activity in
      encouraging inroads into the continent, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      suggestion.


16.   “The search for new markets was the main economic cause of the partition of Africa.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the search for new markets primarily caused the partition of Africa. Candidates may refer to
      how the search for new markets was spurred on by the saturation of European markets and the
      belief that Africa offered lucrative trading opportunities. They may also argue that the European
      powers required raw materials to support industrial growth and Africa provided a plethora of cheap
      raw materials such as cocoa, cotton and a range of minerals. The role of companies such as the
      Royal Niger Company and the Imperial British East African Company may also be addressed.
      While other relevant factors, for example rivalries between European states keen on asserting their
      pre-eminence, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   “Economic discontent was the major factor that led to Mandinka resistance to French rule.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement in
      the question. Candidates may refer to Mandinka fears that their economic prosperity was under
      threat and the concerns of Samori Toure that the French would threaten Mandinka agriculture, the
      Bure gold mine and the major trading centre at Kankan. While other relevant factors, for example
      the politically motivated aspects of Mandinka resistance (which included the desire to regain cities
      that had been lost to the French) and the desire to retain Islamic leadership in the kingdom, may
      be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


18.   Evaluate the reasons for the failure of Herero and Nama resistance in Namibia.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the failure of Herero
      and Nama resistance, weighing up the importance or otherwise of each factor. Candidates may
      refer to the progressive weakening of the Herero and Nama prior to the conflict because of the loss
      of land due to German expropriation and the loss of cattle herds to rinderpest. Other problems
      included those caused by disunity, for example the Nama failed to give support to the Herero at the
      beginning of the rising, or they may address the demoralization of the Nama following the deaths of
      Witbooi in 1906 and Morenga in 1907. Additionally, the success of German strategy could be
      addressed as could the military superiority of German soldiers. Many of the Herero died of
      starvation or dehydration as they fled from the German attack. The treatment of Herero and Nama
      resistance need not be equal in terms of volume of coverage; however, both must be addressed.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Evaluate the economic and social impact of British rule in Kenya to 1963.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of British rule in Kenya up
      to 1963, weighing up the importance or otherwise of the economic and social effects. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of economic and social factors, or they may prioritize their evaluation of
      one over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. For the economic impact, candidates may refer to
      improvements in the transport system with the construction of all-weather roads and railway lines,
      and the advances that were made to communications and industrial developments. In terms of
      social changes, there may be some focus on how education gradually became formalized, the
      increased use of western medicine that inhibited the spread of tropical diseases and the
      development of agricultural practices. Candidates may suggest that a major social and economic
      effect was the introduction of plantation agriculture and a European settler community in the White
      Highlands. Both importance and limitations of the impact of British rule must be clearly indicated
      but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other relevant factors may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.



20.   Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the colonial administration of Senegal to 1960.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the strengths and
      weaknesses of the colonial administration of Senegal up to the given time. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of strengths and weaknesses or they may prioritize their discussion of one over the
      other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      system of assimilation that was used to replace traditional Senegalese culture and advance the
      French language. They may suggest that France utilized Senegal for the benefit of France, for
      example, Senegal was permitted to trade only with France. There may be reference to the
      development of the Senegalese economy with its production of cash crops (mainly groundnuts), or
      reference the development of education.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Evaluate the role of nationalist movements in the achievement of independence in Angola.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of nationalist movements in
      Angola, weighing up their importance or otherwise to the country’s achievement of independence.
      Candidates may note that, by the 1950s, Angolan nationalism was based on ethnicity around the
      Mbundu, Bakongo and Ovimbundu groups and that later nationalist movements claimed to be
      more representative of the whole nation. Angola’s war of independence between 1961 and 1974
      involved several nationalist movements fighting against Portuguese rule. There may also be an
      evaluation of the comparative contributions of the different movements, for example, candidates
      may conclude that the MPLA. Which initiated the armed struggle, was most significant. While
      other relevant factors, for example the impact of foreign countries who may have supported the
      various nationalist resistance groups may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question.



22.   To what extent did the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) contribute to Tanganyika’s
      achievement of independence?

      The question requires that candidates consider the contribution of the Tanganyika African National
      Union (TANU) to Tanganyika’s achievement of independence. Candidates may refer to the role of
      Nyerere and his associates in in transforming the Tanganyika African Association (TAA) to a more
      politicized organization. They may also focus on TANU’s role in enabling people to put across their
      grievances in a non-violent way. In the 1960 Legislative Assembly election, TANU received the
      majority of votes and in 1961 the country became independent with Nyerere as its first prime
      minister. While other relevant factors, for example Tanganyika’s existence as a trust territory which
      was likely to be granted independence in any case, may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   Discuss the impact of the Crimean War on the Ottoman Empire.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      Crimean War on the Ottoman Empire. Candidates may refer to the challenge to Ottoman authority
      and territory by Russia and how, with support from Britain and France, it overcame that
      challenge—at least in the short term. During the war, the Ottomans reacquired territory
      (Bessarabia) that had been seized by Russia and, following the conclusion of the war, the empire
      could benefit from the security brought about by the demilitarization of the Black Sea. In addition
      to this, it forged better relations with the West following its wartime alliance. Within the empire,
      there was also an upswing in Turkish nationalism and an increased determination to resist external
      threats. This created a new movement for modernization and reform as well as a renewed
      dedication to Islam. However, it could be argued that complacency set in due to the empire being
      on the “winning side”, and that led to the Ottomans neglecting the need for reform and, therefore,
      further deterioration of the Ottoman Empire. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the
      bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


24.   Evaluate the reasons for the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons why the Ottomans entered
      the First World War. Candidates may refer to the impact of Turkish nationalism, noting that the
      Turkish government was, in 1914, under the control of the Young Turks (CUP), who were
      determined to increase Turkish power and recover Turkish territory and prestige. Candidates may
      also note the hostility that was felt towards Russia following the Ottoman Empire’s defeat in the
      Balkan wars earlier in the decade, as well as lingering suspicion about Russian intentions in the
      Black Sea. The role of the burgeoning Germano-Turkish relationship may also be evaluated, with
      candidates perhaps noting that Germany had for some time been providing extensive military and
      economic support to the Ottomans in an attempt to counter the influence of the Entente powers. In
      the short term, events such as Britain’s seizure of two new Turkish warships, as well as the signing
      of an alliance between Germany and Turkey (both of which occurred in the summer of 1914) may
      have sealed the Ottomans’ decision.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   “The Arab Revolt had little impact on the territorial settlement in the Middle East after the First
      World War.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the impact of Sharif Hussein, the leader of the revolt, who
      aspired to become the leader of a new kingdom that would comprise Syria and Mesopotamia.
      Hussein had offered the British assistance in their fight against the Ottomans; however, prior to
      1916 Britain had no need of his help and this was reflected in the 1915 McMahon–Hussein
      correspondence, in which Britain made no firm commitments to support an independent Arab state.
      In fact, by the time that the Arab revolt began in mid-1916, the Sykes–Picot Agreement had
      already been agreed and this outlined the basic principles behind the proposed division of the
      Middle East. Conflict between Hussein and the Saud family also tempered the significance of the
      Arab revolt as Britain supported both sides. While other relevant factors that contributed to the
      territorial settlement, for example the mandate system, the British pursuit of oil in Iraq and the
      French refusal to reduce their claims in Syria, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement.


26.   Evaluate the attempts at modernization in Iran or Saudi Arabia or one North African state.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the attempts to modernize one of the
      stated territories (or another one relevant territory of the candidates’ choice), weighing up the
      strengths and limitations of those attempts. For Iran, candidates may refer to Reza Shah’s
      programme of modernization (which met with limited results); for Saudi Arabia they may refer to its
      unification as a country in 1932, and the limited modernizations it achieved before that time (and
      before the discovery of oil in the country in 1938); for the alternative state, much will depend on
      that chosen, as the degree of modernization varied significantly and was sometimes dependent on
      the degree of European influence that had been exerted on the region.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community
                 (20th century)

27.   Discuss the reasons for the formation and the collapse of the East African Community (EAC)
      (1967–1977).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the factors
      identified in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the reasons for formation and
      collapse of the East African Community (EAC), or they may spend more time discussing one over
      the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may suggest that
      the EAC was formed to strengthen relations and promote development between Kenya, Tanzania
      and Uganda. They may further suggest that it attempted to develop trade in the region, sought to
      establish parity of currencies and provide for a common school leaving examination. In terms of its
      collapse, candidates may allude to the feeling of the other countries that Kenya was benefitting
      more and that Kenya’s demand to have more power in decision making led the leaders of Uganda
      and Tanzania to feel that they were losing control of the organization. Other factors including the
      demand from Idi Amin that Tanzania stopped harbouring his enemies, and the ideological
      differences between socialist Tanzania and capitalist Kenya may also have contributed to its
      collapse.


28.   Evaluate the impact of the Cold War on two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Cold War on two
      African countries, weighing up the strengths and limitations of that impact. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of the two countries, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one over the other.
      Nevertheless, two countries must be dealt with and a comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may refer to how the Cold War contributed to proxy wars in Africa, noting how
      the Soviet Union sought to win over African support by providing money and military support while
      the US aimed to stymie the spread of communism in the continent. These proxy wars contributed
      to both social and economic problems in Africa, sometimes, for example, worsening the refugee
      situation. While other relevant factors may be referred to in order to contextualize the impact or
      otherwise of the Cold War, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                 – 21 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   To what extent did economic issues cause the South African War?

      The question requires that candidates consider significance of economic causes to the outbreak of
      the South African War. Causes may predate the timeframe of the topic, but they must be both
      relevant and clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to hostility
      caused by the refusal of the British colonies to enter a trade agreement with the Transvaal, or the
      exclusion of the Transvaal from the coast, due to them being denied rail access. The Boers were
      angered by this and they were alarmed by the influx of workers into the region following the
      discovery of gold in the Transvaal. However, the discovery also afforded the Boers wealth and as
      this increased, so did their determination to be independent, to dominate South Africa and to force
      access to the coast. While other relevant factors—for example British imperial ambitions and the
      intransigence of men such as Chamberlain, Milner and Rhodes, as well as British prejudices
      regarding the Kruger government's "backwardness" and doubts about its ability to successfully
      exploit the immense economic potential of the region—may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question.


30.   Discuss the reasons why policy in South Africa changed from segregation to apartheid in 1948.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the change in policy in 1948. Candidates may refer to the rise of Afrikaner nationalism in the
      1930s which was inspired by the Broederbond organization and its political arm, the National Party,
      which felt increasingly threatened by both British and indigenous populations. The changing
      demographics in South Africa during the Second World War also contributed to a rise in Afrikaner
      nationalism. Indigenous workers who had moved to urban areas began to demand better payment
      and conditions and this raised fears among Afrikaners that may lose economic and political power.
      The declining white population, relative to the indigenous population, was also a cause for concern
      for the white holders of power who wanted to ensure that they retained the pre-eminent political
      position. Other factors, such as the desire to prevent the spread of communist ideas, the influence
      of Nazism on Afrikaner politics, post-war growth and the increasing militancy of the ANC may also
      be offered as reasons for the change in policy.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   Evaluate the factors that promoted and inhibited the spread of Islam in Africa in the 19th and 20th
      centuries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors that promoted and inhibited
      the spread of Islam in Africa during the named timeframe, weighing up the importance or otherwise
      of those factors. Candidates may offer equal coverage of “promoted” and “inhibited” or there may
      be more focus on one. Some factors may have aspects of both; however, the candidates’
      evaluation must feature both aspects. Candidates may refer to the role of traders in spreading the
      Islam throughout the continent as well as the fact that the those who carried its message were
      Africans or from the Middle East and were therefore not associated with any invading power. A
      rise in Islamic consciousness in the latter part of the 20th century as well as the wealth and power
      of Islamic states and the appeal of Islamic values also served to encourage increased numbers of
      adherents. However, the expansion of Christianity inhibited the spread of Islam and several
      Western powers devoted significant resources to convert large numbers of Africans. Conversion to
      Christianity also provided substantial economic benefits as well as access to education and the
      support of colonial governments.


32.   With reference to two countries, evaluate the social and cultural impact of technological
      developments to 2000.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the impact of communications technology, which had a significant impact
      on both society and culture as it provided better means for communication and sharing knowledge.
      While these changes could be deemed to be improvements, they were challenging to established
      cultural values. Technological developments also made the provision of education more
      widespread and may have increased literacy rates. Medical technology has had a role in in
      reducing death rates and improving the treatment rate of diseases and reducing the number of
      infections. While other relevant factors, for example economic developments, may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.   To what extent were the political developments and economic policies of Nasser successful?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Nasser’s policies were successful. Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and economic
      developments or they may emphasize the importance of one over the other; however, both aspects
      will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates
      may refer to Nasser’s aim to free Egypt from British control, which was accomplished in 1956.
      After this, Egypt became a leader in the Middle East and an influence in world affairs. Nasser was
      also successful in achieving his aim of establishing a single-party state (although this may not
      widely be recognized as a success). His economic policies led to improvements in education,
      healthcare, housing and women’s rights; however, many of these were limited by the increased
      level of military spending. While the policies may have been aimed produce a modern and
      progressive state, they did not lead to political development as no democratic institutions were
      introduced.


34.   “The 1979 Revolution in Iran was the result of the policies of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates may refer to the White Revolution, which aimed tom modernize Iran socially and
      economically. They maty argue that while the policies produced changes, they also led to much
      discontent from dispossessed peasants, urban workers and religious leaders, the latter group
      objecting to the changing role of women, for example. The Shah’s foreign policy was also
      unpopular as he was perceived as being too close to the US. Further, sound relations with Israel
      alienated many within Iranian society. The increasing pace of Westernization, which offended the
      clergy and traditionally-minded Iranians may also be discussed, as could the appeal of leaders
      such as Ayatollah Khomeini who objected to these policies and the direction they were taking Iran.
      While other relevant factors, for example the extravagance of the regime, may be referred to, the
      bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

Section 18: Post-independence politics in Africa to 2005

35.   “Poverty and disease were the most significant social and economic challenges facing African
      countries.” Discuss with reference to two countries to 2005.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement in
      the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the chosen countries, or they may
      emphasize their discussion of one over the other. However, both will be a feature of the response
      and a comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the extent to which
      countries developed new industries, the development of new resources, the level of foreign aid and
      the existence of trade initiatives. The existence and/or severity of poverty in the two countries may
      vary substantially and so a range of factual support is likely. While other relevant factors, for
      example civil unrest may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


36.   “The need for effective government was the most important reason for the establishment of
      single-party states.” Discuss with reference to two countries to 2005.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the need for effective government was the most important reason for the establishment of
      single-party states in two countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries or
      they may emphasize their discussion of one over the other; however, both will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      perceived inability of democratically-elected regimes to satisfy the demands of the population on a
      variety of issues as a powerful reason for the emergence of a single-party state. These issues
      may include economic development, racial tension, corruption or a lack of clear direction for the
      country. While other relevant factors, for example the emergence of a charismatic leader of
      pressure from foreign countries, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
