Answer one question.

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and, where relevant, large,
well drawn maps, sketches and diagrams.

1.   (a)   Using one or more examples, analyse the geographic challenges associated with
           transboundary pollution.                                                                  [10]

     (b)   Examine how disparities between countries give rise to different global flows.            [15]



2.   (a)   In a global context, analyse what is meant by “core areas” and “peripheries”.             [10]

     (b)   “Globalization involves the imposition of Western culture on the entire world.” To what
           extent do you agree with this statement?                                                  [15]


3.   (a)   Referring to named countries, analyse how people’s participation in information and
           communications technology (ICT) networks is changing.                                     [10]

     (b)   Examine how far the social and environmental costs of globalization can be reduced
           without also losing its benefits.                                                         [15]
