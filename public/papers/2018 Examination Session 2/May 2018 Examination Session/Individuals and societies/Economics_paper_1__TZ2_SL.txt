Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain how the price elasticity of demand for a good might be affected by the number
           and closeness of substitutes.                                                             [10]

     (b)   Examine the significance of price elasticity of demand for the decision making of firms
           and government.                                                                           [15]


2.   (a)   Explain why the exploitation of common access resources, such as uncontrolled
           fishing, might pose a threat to sustainability.                                           [10]

     (b)   Evaluate whether the use of carbon taxes is the most effective way for the government
           to deal with the threat to sustainability posed by the use of fossil fuels.               [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain how an increase in investment might lead to economic growth.                    [10]

     (b)   Discuss the possible consequences of economic growth on living standards,
           unemployment and inflation.                                                             [15]


4.   (a)   Explain how expansionary fiscal policy could be used to close a deflationary
           (recessionary) gap.                                                                     [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that fiscal policy is the most effective way of achieving long-term
           economic growth.                                                                        [15]
