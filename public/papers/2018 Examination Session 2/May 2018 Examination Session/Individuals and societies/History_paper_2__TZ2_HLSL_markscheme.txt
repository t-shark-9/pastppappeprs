Markbands for paper 2

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
 10–12     The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
 7–9       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
           historical context.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant. The response makes links
           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
 4–6       The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
           understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
 1–3       There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   “There were significant changes in travel and transportation between 750 and 1400.” With
     reference to two societies, each from a different region, to what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the hypothesis that travel and transportation
     changed significantly between 750 and 1400. While the focus of the response must be within the
     timeframe of this topic, the societies under discussion need not be contemporaneous with each
     other. The societies must come from different regions. The chosen societies may be considered
     separately or a thematic approach may be adopted. Candidates may consider that changes in
     travel and transportation may have come in the form of increasing quantities of trade, which may or
     may not have been the result of technical improvements. It would be valid to show that in some
     cases change was limited by, for example, the lack of improvement in the quality of roads in some
     parts of the world, and the difficulties presented by river transport. Candidates may choose to
     consider elements of both change and continuity.


2.   “The support of rulers was the main factor enabling the spread of religion.” With reference to two
     societies, each from a different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the hypothesis in relation to two societies,
     although the number of rulers is not specified. While the focus of the response must be within the
     timeframe of this topic, the two societies need not be contemporaneous with each other. However,
     the two societies must come from different regions. Candidates may choose, for example, to
     consider societies where political power was closely linked to, or supported by, religion; there may
     be examples of the spread of religion through conquest or as a result of natural disasters.
     Candidates may choose to weigh the importance of rulers’ support, or lack thereof, against other
     factors. Each society may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted if
     candidates wish to compare the importance of rulers’ support to the spread of religion.
                                                  –7–                  M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   To what extent were tactics the most significant factor in determining the course of two medieval
     wars?

     Candidates will consider the merits of the proposition that tactics were the most significant factor in
     determining the course of two medieval wars. While the focus of the response must be within the
     timeframe of this topic, the two wars need not be contemporaneous with each other. The wars
     may or may not come from different regions. Candidates will ensure that consideration of tactics
     goes beyond description to explain how outcomes were affected. Candidates may focus on how
     fighting units on land or sea, such as light or heavy cavalry, heavily armed or more mobile infantry,
     or fighting ships, were exploited effectively, perhaps by achieving surprise or overwhelming
     numbers. For comparison, candidates may consider the roles of logistics, improved equipment,
     charismatic leadership or improved training. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic
     approach may be adopted.


4.   With reference to two examples, each relating to a different medieval war, discuss the results of
     treaties and/or truces.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the results of two treaties and/or truces,
     which must relate to different medieval wars. While the focus of the response must be largely
     within the timeframe of this topic, the two treaties need not be contemporaneous with each other;
     the wars from which they resulted may or may not come from the same region. Depending on the
     treaties chosen, the candidates’ analysis of the impact of treaties may extend beyond 1500. In this
     way, events that occurred outside of the topic timeframe may be considered relevant. Candidates
     will not list treaty terms but focus on each treaty’s impact, which may be, for example, political,
     economic or religious. Candidates may follow either a comparative approach or discuss the two
     treaties separately. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be
     adopted.
                                                   –8–                  M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Compare and contrast the methods used by two medieval rulers to expand their power.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the methods used by
     two medieval rulers to expand their power, referring to both rulers throughout. While the focus of
     the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two rulers need not have been
     contemporaries and they may or may not be chosen from a different region. Methods under
     scrutiny could include the exploitation of lineage or marriage, claims to religious or divine support,
     opportunistic exploitation of neighbours’ weakness or division, exploration or commercial
     expansion. To achieve comparison or contrast, methods must be assessed rather than merely
     described.


6.   “Medieval rulers were mostly successful in overcoming the challenges posed by rebellion and/or
     political opposition.” Discuss with reference to two medieval rulers.

     With reference to two rulers, candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the
     hypothesis that rulers were mostly successful in overcoming the challenges posed by rebellion
     and/or political opposition. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this
     topic, the two rulers need not be contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from a
     different region. The focus of the answer will be on the extent to which challenges were overcome,
     rather than on the methods used. Therefore, candidates may consider, for example, whether
     rebels’/opponents’ aims were mostly thwarted, whether the defeat of opposition was temporary or
     longer-lasting, or whether there were political compromises, or conversely, concentration of power.
     Consideration of foreign opposition is valid.
                                                 –9–                 M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in Transition (1400–1700)

7.   To what extent was social and economic change in one early modern society influenced by
     population movement?

     Candidates will consider the degree to which social and economic change was influenced by
     population movement. The focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic.
     Candidates need not provide equal treatment of social and economic changes, although both must
     be discussed. Candidates may, for example, consider the impact of the establishment of colonies,
     such as on the relationship between colonizers and indigenous peoples, trade patterns and on
     economic activity. Alternatively, the social and economic impact of the expansion of slavery, both
     on the societies supplying the slaves and the economies that employed them, may be considered.
     Consideration of the religious impact of population movement would be valid. Other factors in
     promoting social and economic change, such as war, disease and climate, may be considered for
     comparison.


8.   Discuss the impact on society and culture of two intellectual movements.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the impact on society and culture of two
     intellectual movements, which, while not needing to be contemporaneous with each other, must fall
     within the timeframe of the topic. The examples chosen may or may not come from different
     regions, and candidates may discuss the impact on states, regions, or geographical areas. It is not
     necessary to treat society and culture equally. Candidates may, for example, refer to changes in
     art, literature, scientific discoveries and exploration, religion and education. Discussion of the
     relationship between a cultural movement and social or political discontent would be valid.
     Candidates will go beyond description of movements to focus on impact. Each intellectual
     movement may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted to compare the impact
     on society or culture.
                                                  – 10 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 5: Early modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Compare and contrast the nature of power and rule in one state in ascendancy and one state in
      decline.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the nature of power and
      rule in one state in ascendancy and one in decline, referring to both states throughout. While the
      focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the chosen states do not need to
      have existed at the same time. They may or may not come from the same region. Candidates
      may, for example, consider the role of economic and financial structures, factors which contributed
      to social discontent, or, conversely, cohesion, or the roles of religion or war. The relationship
      between local and central authority may be considered.


10.   To what extent were issues of succession the main cause of conflict in two early modern states?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the proposition that issues of succession were
      the main cause of conflict in two early modern states. While the focus of the response must be
      within the timeframe of this topic, the periods of study of the two chosen states do not need to have
      existed at the same time. The states may or may not come from the same region. Candidates
      may follow either a comparative approach or discuss the two states separately. Candidates may
      focus on whether succession conflicts, sometimes resulting from the accession of minors and the
      role of regents, were the most significant rivalries, or if these issues involved or concealed other
      causes such as religious conflict. Candidates may consider other causes of conflict, such as
      rivalries between elites, interference of foreign powers or economic factors.
                                                 – 11 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of early modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the importance of foreign influence and/or involvement in the outcome of two
      early modern wars.

      Candidates will appraise the importance of foreign involvement in the outcome of two early modern
      wars chosen from the timeframe of the topic. The wars chosen do not need to have occurred at
      the same time and they may or may not come from different regions. Each war may be considered
      separately, or a thematic approach may be adopted. Foreign involvement may, for example, have
      come directly from sovereign powers, or been in the form of mercenary troops or diplomatic
      support. Candidates will ensure that evaluation of foreign involvement is linked to outcomes of the
      chosen wars. In some cases, foreign involvement may not have secured victory; in others,
      candidates may consider whether victory could have been achieved without it. In evaluating
      importance, candidates may compare the importance of other factors, which may be economic,
      geographical, tactical or strategic.


12.   Evaluate the political impact of two early modern wars.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the political impact of two wars, which may or may not come
      from the same region. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of the topic,
      the candidates’ analysis of “impact” may go beyond 1750 provided direct links are made to the war,
      which must have occurred on or prior to this date. The wars chosen do not need to have occurred
      at the same time. Candidates may consider the political impact within states, such as the
      extension or diminution of central authority, or the transfer of power from one ruler to another.
      There may be consideration of the wars’ international political ramifications. In order to gauge the
      political impact, other types of impact may be considered. Each war may be considered
      separately, or a thematic approach may be adopted.
                                                   – 12 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate the significance of mass production in two countries, each from a different region.

      Candidates will appraise the significance of mass production in two countries, which must come
      from different regions. “Mass production” refers to the production or manufacture of standardized
      goods in large quantities, especially by machinery. While the focus of the response must be within
      the timeframe of this topic, the two examples chosen do not need to be contemporaneous with
      each other. Candidates may evaluate the significance of mass production throughout the
      timeframe, or they may choose a narrower period. Each country may be considered separately or
      a thematic approach may be adopted. Candidates may, for example, evaluate the impact of mass
      production on the cost of goods, employment patterns, transport, living standards, social structure
      and labour conditions. There may also have been political consequences, such as the emergence
      of new parties and trade unions. The internationalization of mass production may have enabled
      the emergence of new economies in the developing world.


14.   Compare and contrast the impact of industrialization on the standards of living in two countries.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences of the impact of industrialization
      on the standards of living in two countries, referring to both throughout. Those countries may or
      may not be drawn from the same region. While the focus of the response must be within the
      timeframe of this topic, the two examples chosen need not be contemporaneous with each other.
      Areas for consideration could, among others, include the speed of urban growth and the quality of
      city planning, the use of child and female labour, real wages and environmental impact.
      Candidates may point out the positive as well as the negative impact of industrialization in both the
      short and long term on living standards.
                                                  – 13 –               M18/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Compare and contrast the importance of nationalism to two independence movements, each from
      a different region.

      Candidates will give an account of how similar and different the importance of nationalism was in
      two independence movements referring to both movements throughout. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two movements chosen need not be
      contemporaneous with each other. They may compare the spread of nationalist ideas among
      different social groups, different ideologies that promoted independence and nationalism’s role in
      promoting insurrection. They may weigh the roles of other factors such as the economic policies of
      colonial powers or international intervention. It would be valid to consider the response of colonial
      powers to the growth of nationalism, which may have further provoked nationalist insurrection or,
      conversely, eased the passage to independence.


16.   To what extent did one state, in the first ten years following independence, effectively respond to
      social and economic challenges?

      Candidates are required to consider the extent to which one newly independent state responded
      effectively to social and economic challenges. Social challenges may refer to the integration of, or
      confrontation with, diverse social, ethnic, racial or religious groups. Economic challenges may
      include the country’s modernization, the need to formulate new economic and fiscal policies,
      integration into the world market, lack of capital, a need to reform land ownership or tackle
      dependency on another nation. In some cases, candidates may consider whether a newly
      independent state has recovered from the social and economic damage inflicted by a war of
      independence. There may have been the social challenge of deciding how to treat a colonial elite.
      Equal treatment of social and economic challenges is not necessary. There is some allowance for
      the effects of the policies beyond ten years if it is relevant to the response.

Topic 9: Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   “Greater equality in democratic states was the result of pressure from suffrage movements.”
      Discuss with reference to two democratic states, each from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that greater equality was
      the result of pressure from suffrage movements in democratic states. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be
      contemporaneous with each other, but they must come from different regions. “Suffrage
      Movements” refers to organized action to provide a disenfranchised group with the right to vote.
      Such groups may, for example, include women, religious minorities, indigenous peoples, the poor
      and the uneducated. Candidates will discuss the linkage between extension of the vote and
      political, social and/or economic equality. It would be valid to choose examples where no such
      progress had taken place, or where extension of the vote was not due to suffrage movements.
      The examples may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted.


18.   Evaluate the impact of democracy on social policies in two democratic states.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of democracy on social policies in two democratic
      states, which may or may not be from the same region. While the focus of response must be
      within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be contemporaneous with each
      other. Candidates may consider the extent of change in the educational system after the
      establishment, or during the evolution, of democracy. They may address social welfare policies
      and/or policies towards women and minorities. There may be some crossover into socio-economic
      policies in candidates’ responses. The examples may be considered separately or a thematic
      approach may be adopted.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   Compare and contrast the importance of propaganda to the emergence of two authoritarian states.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the importance of
      propaganda in the emergence of two authoritarian states referring to both throughout. While the
      focus of response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be
      contemporaneous with each other, nor need they be from the same region. Candidates will focus
      on authoritarian states during their emergence, rather than after the leaders obtained power.
      Rather than describe propaganda in both cases, candidates will explain its importance to the
      emergence of the authoritarian states. Candidates may gauge the importance of propaganda by
      comparing its role with other factors, such as economic distress, leaders’ charisma or the collapse
      of the existing government.


20.   To what extent was authoritarian control achieved in two 20th-century states?

      Candidates are required to consider the degree of authoritarian control achieved in two
      authoritarian states, which may or may not come from the same region. While the focus of
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the examples chosen need not be
      contemporaneous with each other. Candidates should go beyond description of measures and
      focus on the degree of control achieved. They may challenge the notion of full control. Areas for
      consideration could, among others, include the existence and role of representative institutions,
      control over, or elimination of, political parties which challenged the centre, control over institutions
      such as trade unions, the army or churches, control over culture and the media, bureaucratic
      efficiency and the effectiveness of security services, which may or may not have been dependent
      on informers and public support. The states may be considered separately or a thematic approach
      may be adopted.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   Examine the long- and short-term causes of one 20th-century war.

      Candidates must consider the role of long- and short-term causes of one 20th-century war.
      Candidates should go beyond description of the causes and instead consider their significance.
      It would be valid for candidates to propose that long-term causes may have laid the foundations for
      the emergence of short-term or immediate causes. An exact balance between the two types of
      cause is not necessary. A wide variety of approaches is possible. Long-term cultural, ethnic,
      economic or religious causes may have produced festering resentment, while in the shorter term
      the war may have been triggered by particular events, such as the accession to power of
      aggressive leaders, or sudden changes in policy that made countries or groups feel under threat.
      The terms long and short term are not susceptible to exact definition; examiners should be flexible.


22.   With reference to one 20th-century war, compare and contrast the political repercussions for two
      countries.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and difference between the political
      repercussions of one war for two countries, referring to both countries throughout. The chosen
      countries may or may not come from the same region. Depending on the war chosen, the
      candidates’ analysis of political repercussions may extend beyond 2000. In this way, events which
      occurred in the first eight years (in line with the 10-year rule) of the 21st century may be considered
      relevant. Candidates may, for example, consider territorial changes, countries where wars created
      political instability or regime change, countries where a political leader’s prestige was enhanced, or
      countries where the experience of war promoted isolationism or, conversely, a determination to
      prevent future conflict.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “Economic problems between 1980 and 1991 were the most significant reason for the end of the
      Cold War.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates must consider the merits or otherwise of the proposition that economic problems
      between 1980 and 1991 were the most significant reason for the end of the Cold War. While they
      should focus on economic factors, others may be considered for comparison. Candidates should
      be mindful that the question is about the end of the Cold War and not the collapse of the USSR
      and Eastern European communist regimes. Therefore, answers should focus on the reasons for
      the easing of tension between communism and the west. There may be consideration, for
      example, of the impact of economic problems which afflicted the USSR and Soviet satellite
      countries in Eastern Europe, which contrasted with relative prosperity in the US and her western
      allies. Other factors may be considered for comparison, such as the role of leaders and demands
      for political reform in Eastern Europe.


24.   Compare and contrast the impact of two leaders, each from a different region, on the development
      of the Cold War.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the impact of two
      leaders on the development of the Cold War, referring to both leaders throughout. While the focus
      of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the chosen leaders need not have been
      contemporaries. They must, however, be drawn from different regions. The response must
      compare specifically the ways in which the chosen leaders affected the course of the Cold War and
      this could be addressed with reference to their policies that may or may not have improved or
      worsened superpower relations. Alternatively, leaders of smaller states may have had
      considerable impact on the course of the Cold War by commencing actions that may have led to
      wars or crises.
