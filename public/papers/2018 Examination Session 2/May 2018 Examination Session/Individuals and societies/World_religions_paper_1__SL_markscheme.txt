Paper 1 part (b) markbands


     Marks       Level descriptor



       0         The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



                 The response displays little understanding of the demands of the question. The
      1–2        response is descriptive in nature and where examples are referred to, they are
                 factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
                 Terminology used is incorrect or inaccurate.


                 The response displays an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
                 are only partially addressed. There is some explanation, but this is not fully
      3–4        developed. Examples used are generally appropriate and relevant but do not always
                 support the explanation.
                 The use of relevant terminology is mostly accurate, with some inconsistencies.



                 The demands of the question are met. The response contains a well-developed
      5–6        explanation, which is effectively supported by appropriate and relevant examples.
                 The use of relevant terminology is accurate throughout the response.

                                               Section A
Hinduism

1.   “Thus we may say that we are what we desire. Our will springs from our desires; our actions
     spring from our will and what we are, springs from our actions. We may conclude, therefore, that
     the state of our desires at the time of death determines our next life; we return to earth in order to
     satisfy those desires.”

                                                                        Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4: 5.6a


     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                                      [3]

           •   We are what we desire.
           •   What we desire affects what we want.
           •   What we want affects our actions (karma).
           •   What we desire at death determines our next life.
           •   We return to earth (cycle of samsara or reincarnation) as a result of/in order to
               satisfy these desires.
           •   Our will comes from our desires.
           •   Our actions spring from our will.
           •   What we are comes from our actions.
           •   There is an atman that transmigrates at death.

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain why Hindus believe that acting according to dharma/dhamma can achieve
           moksha (liberation).                                                                           [6]

           • Acting according to dharma (law or teachings) creates good karma.
           • Varnashramadharma – a person’s responsibility to act according to one’s caste
             duties – eg a Vaishya (merchant) earns good karma from conducting good
             business.
           • Good karma can be gained from acting according with one’s stage in life
             (householder, student, etc).
           • Accumulating good karma contributes towards the achievement of
             moksha/liberation.
           • Following one of the yogic paths is also part of acting according to dharma.
           • Selfless action is also stressed within the dharma.
           • The link between acting according to dharma/dhamma and moksha is present in
             the sacred texts.

Buddhism

2.   “Those who are freed from desires are well established in the teaching of Gotama [the Buddha]
     with firm mind. They have attained to that which should be attained, having plunged into immortal
     Nibbana.”

                                                                              Sutta Nipata 228 (adapted)


     (a)   Outline three teachings in this passage about “immortal Nibbana”.                         [3]

           •   Nibbana/nirvana is the goal of the Buddhist path.
           •   It is reached when all desires have been eradicated.
           •   It is reached through following the teachings of the Buddha.
           •   Those who are freed from desires have a firm mind.
           •   Those who are freed from desires are established in the teaching of the Buddha.
           •   Nibbana/nirvana is immortal.

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain other goals that a Buddhist might aim for (other than nibbana/nirvana).           [6]

           • Some Buddhists aim for a better rebirth within samsara after death.
           • This rebirth could be in a heavenly realm or as a richer human being.
           • They aim for a better rebirth because they believe that it will take many lives to
             attain nibbana/nirvana, and a better rebirth will bring them closer to it.
           • Some Mahayana Buddhists aim to become a Bodhisattva, a Buddha-to-Be, or a
             Buddha.
           • They aim to become a Bodhisattva or a Buddha because they wish to help others
             reach enlightenment or liberation through compassion.
           • Some Buddhists take the Bodhisattva Vow – that they will not leave samsara until
             all beings have reached enlightenment.

           Candidates who repeat the teachings of nibbana/nirvana should not be credited
           unless it is to say that a Buddha attains nibbana/nirvana for the purpose of helping
           others.

Sikhism

3.   “With my hands I do His work; with my tongue I sing His Glorious Praises.
     With my feet, I walk on the Path of my Lord and Master.
     It is a good time, when I remember Him in meditation.
     Meditating on the Nam, the Name of the Lord, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.”

                                                                                 Guru Granth Sahib 189


     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                               [3]

           •   Work with the hands is God’s work.
           •   The feet can be used to walk God’s path.
           •   Sikhs use their voices to praise God.
           •   Meditation is an important way to follow God.

     (b)   Explain the importance of practising nam japna (continual meditation on God’s name).    [6]

           • Sikhs believe in worshipping One God who lives everywhere and in every
             person’s heart.
           • Every Sikh is required to worship and adore God’s name.
           • The name of God washes away the dirt of the mind.
           • The importance of nam japna (meditation on God’s name or entire being and
             personality) is that it is the only way to attain unity with God.
           • It is important because Guru Nanak taught and practised nam japna.
           • Sikhism places great stress on the importance of nam japna in helping them to
             lead a virtuous, pure and pious life. This can be only be attained by always
             remembering and repeating the name of God with full concentration, breath by
             breath.
           • In accordance with the main tenets of Sikhism nam japna creates love and
             affection for everyone.
           • Because a pious person is compassionate and contented, this means that they
             will serve the poor (one of the most important aspects of sewa) and have no
             negative feelings towards others.

           • The struggle for each human being is between an inclination to do good (yetzer
             ha-tov) and an inclination to do evil (yetzer ha-ra).
           • Yetzer ha-ra entered Adam when he ate from the tree of knowledge of good and

Christianity

5.   “Thus it is written, ‘The first man, Adam, became a living being’; the last Adam became a life-giving
     spirit. But it is not the spiritual that is first, but the physical, and then the spiritual. The first man
     was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. […] Just as we have borne the
     image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the man of heaven.”

                                                                           1 Corinthians 15:45–49 (adapted)


     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                                        [3]

           • Adam was the first man.
           • Adam was made from dust.
           • The second man is from heaven (Jesus).
           • The second man is spiritual (Jesus).

             spiritual image from Jesus, the man of heaven.
           • Credit should be given to candidates who identify the second man as Jesus – a
             “Second Adam”.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain Christian teaching about salvation through Jesus Christ.                                 [6]

           • Most Christians believe that those who recognize Jesus as Lord and Saviour
             (because of his death and resurrection) will be saved.
           • Jesus also judges both the living and the dead.
           • The link between God and humanity had been broken when Adam and Eve
             introduced Original Sin at the Fall.
           • By choosing to come to earth he was able to teach God’s word.
           • In giving his life willingly for humanity he was able to repair the breach between
             humanity and God.
           • Following the Resurrection and his overcoming of death, humanity was able to
             reach heaven and union with God.
           • Different denomination have different understandings of salvation.
           • The Protestant Church teaches that no one can merit God’s grace by asceticism,
             good works, meditation or performing rituals. Grace (and therefore salvation) is
             purely received through God’s gift.
           • They hold to the teachings of the Reformation: salvation is attained by grace
             alone in Christ alone through faith alone for the Glory of God alone as told in
             Scripture alone.
           • The Catholic Church teaches that receiving the sacraments is essential for
             salvation. It specifically states that it cannot be obtained through faith alone.

Taoism

7.   “Although the road is broad and straight,
     but some people prefer rugged sidepaths.”

                                                                              Lao-Tzu, Tao Te Ching 53

           •   The Tao is broad.
           •   The Tao is straight.
           •   The Tao is accessible to people.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain what Taoism says about the human condition.                                     [6]

           • Humans do not like following the Way of the Tao.
           • They prefer their own side paths.
           • They prefer to act selfishly and independently.
           • These side paths and selfish actions interfere with nature.
           • Interfering with nature causes conflict and disharmony in the world.
           • Humans can only bring the world back into harmony if they stop interfering with
             nature and reduce their selfish wish to dominate the world.
           • Humans can help to bring the world back into harmony by going with the flow of
             the Tao.
           • Relevant references to yin-yang should be credited.

Jainism

8.   “The jiva or the soul is sometimes born in the world of gods, sometimes in hell. Sometimes it
     acquires the body of a demon; all this happens on account of its karma. This jiva sometimes takes
     birth as a worm, as an insect or as an ant.”

                                                                              Uttarādhyayana-sūtra 3.3–4


     (a)   Outline three teachings in this passage.                                                  [3]

           •   The jiva is the soul.
           •   The jiva or soul is sometimes born in the world of gods.
           •   The jiva or soul is sometimes born in hell.
           •   The jiva or soul is sometimes born as a demon.
           •   It is karma that controls rebirth.
           •   As a result of karma a soul may be reborn in the world of the gods or in hell.
           •   Rebirth might not be as a human but could be as a worm, an insect or an ant.

     (b)   Explain Jain teaching about karma and rebirth.                                            [6]

           • Jains believe that all living beings are reborn countless times until they gain
             liberation through wearing away their karma.
           • Jainism upholds the universal law of karma. Every action, thought, word or deed,
             produces an effect, which serves as the cause of another action, and so on.
           • The state of the soul at any given time is due to the karma accumulated over
             countless lives.
           • The Jain doctrine of karma is distinctive from that found in Hinduism or
             Buddhism. Jains believe that karma consists of fine and subtle particles of matter
             which stick to the soul.
           • By effort, discipline and knowledge, people can control karma.
           • Selfish, careless or cruel actions, for instance, harming living beings lead to the
             accumulation of heavy karma which weighs the soul down.
           • Also, suffering which is willingly undertaken disperses karma and helps to lighten
             the soul.
           • To achieve moksha and to escape being reborn, people must free their soul from
             matter. Once the soul is free it will float to the top of the universe to dwell there
             for ever in all-knowing bliss.

Bahá’í Faith

9.   “The whole duty of man in this Day is to attain that share of the flood of grace which God poureth
     forth for him. Let none, therefore, consider the largeness or smallness of the receptacle. The
     portion of some might lie in the palm of a man’s hand, the portion of others might fill a cup, and of
     others even a gallon-measure.”

                                                                Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh


     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                                     [3]

           • It is the sole duty of humanity to share the grace of God which they have
             received.
           • People should not be concerned about the amount of grace they received.
           • It is up to God to decide how much grace anyone receives.
           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain Bahá’í teachings about the concepts of paradise and hell.                             [6]

           • Bahá’í teachings state that there are no such physical places as paradise or hell.
           • They emphasise the eternal journey of the soul towards perfection instead of
             emphasizing paradise and hell.
           • Bahá’í believe that references to “paradise” and “hell” found in the scriptures of
             other religions should be understood symbolically and describe states of
             nearness to and distance from God both in this world and in the realms beyond.
           • Bahá’í believe that in some religious traditions the concept of paradise has also
             been used to describe a future world of peace, harmony, and justice.
