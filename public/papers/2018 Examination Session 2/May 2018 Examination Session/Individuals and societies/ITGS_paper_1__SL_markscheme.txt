Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two functions of an operating system.                                [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • provide user interface/GUI
                  • allows users to run programs/ authenticating users
                  • manages memory
                  • controlling hard drive
                  • allocating processing time to running programs
                  • managing peripherals
                  • launching applications
                  • file management
                  • control system resources
                  • providing utilities
                  • managing hardware
                  • managing security.

                  Award [1] mark for identifying each function of an operating system up to a
                  maximum of [2] marks.

           (ii)   Identify two characteristics of random access memory (RAM).                   [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • RAM stores data that is currently being used
                  • RAM stores instructions from the software programs that are currently
                    running
                  • RAM is volatile – will be erased when the computer is turned off
                  • RAM is both readable and writable
                  • accessing data in RAM is much faster than accessing it from the hard
                    disk
                  • reading data from RAM is usually faster than from ROM
                  • RAM addresses can be accessed in any order
                  • RAM is an example of primary storage.

                  Award [1] mark for identifying each characteristic of random access
                  memory up to a maximum of [2] marks.

      (iii)   Identify two devices that could be used to store a backup of the files that
              employees have saved on their laptops.                                         [2]

              Answers may include:
              • USB drive/flash drive/thumb drive/SD card/pen drive
              • external hard drive (accept responses without “external”)
              • online servers / cloud storage
              • DVD/CD
              • magnetic tape / tape cartridges.

              Award [1] mark for identifying a device that could be used to store the
              backup to a maximum of [2] marks.


(b)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of using cloud-based storage for an RZX
      employee’s work files.                                                                 [6]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages:
      • files stored in the cloud can be accessed from anywhere with internet access
      • files stored in the cloud can be accessed from multiple devices
      • if more storage space is needed then RZX can arrange with the cloud storage
        provider to make this possible almost immediately
      • security measures are provided by the cloud service (backups, firewalls,
        access, encryption of stored files etc) which may reduce the burden on RZX’s
        IT department
      • it may be cost effective for RZX to purchase cloud storage rather than
        purchasing extra storage
      • the IT department will spend less time managing staff files
      • files stored in the cloud would not take up storage space on the laptop
        computers leaving more room for applications etc.
      • cloud storage located in countries with strong privacy laws could help protect
        stored files from access by third parties
      • files stored in the cloud could be shared between employees / worked-on
        collaboratively etc.
      • storing files in the cloud reduces the chance of important files being deleted
        during the vacation maintenance by the IT department.
                                              –8–                 M18/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


       Disadvantages:
       • files cannot be accessed if there is no internet access
       • if internet access is unavailable staff files cannot be saved in the cloud.
          Employees may save files to their laptop. This can lead to problems as files
          could be deleted/lost or even accessed by an unauthorized user
       • employees may find if there are issues relating to the storage of their data
          getting them resolved may be more time consuming than simply walking to an
          employee in the same office
       • security of staff files depends on the security measures provided by the cloud
          service. RZX needs to be assured that the cloud security is adequate
       • cloud storage located in countries with weak privacy laws could risk files being
          accessed by third parties.

(c)   The disposal of old IT equipment is becoming a problem. RZX is considering two options:
      • donating the equipment to a charitable organization
      • sending the equipment to a recycling service.

      Evaluate the implications of these two options.                                           [8]

      Answers may include:

      Donating the equipment:
      • may be seen as an altruistic gesture and good PR for the company
      • is a relatively simple process and ensures that existing equipment can extend
        its working life
      • there may be financial benefits from donating such as tax relief compared to
        recycling
      • donating provides IT equipment to less fortunate people
      • a disclaimer would be essential so the recipients don’t expect RZX to
        install/set up the donated equipment or fix any problems
      • all proprietary software would need to be deleted as this would breach
        licensing agreements
      • all personal and company files would need to be deleted to avoid privacy and
        security issues
      • recipients might just discard equipment when it no longer works instead of
        recycling it
      • charitable organization would need IT support/infrastructure.

      Recycling the equipment:
      • recycling is a better option for items that cannot be donated as they are out of
        date
      • will reduce the environmental impact as less raw materials may need to be
        extracted, etc
      • may be a straighter forward process than donating, the items are simply
        collected from the offices
      • the recycling process may be unethical, for example, children working long
        hours in poor conditions in some countries
      • untrained / unprotected recyclers may be exposed to harmful chemicals/
        toxins
      • not all parts can be recycled so there is still waste that needs to be
        disposed of.
      • all personal and company files would need to be deleted to avoid privacy and
        security issues.
      • recycling can be more expensive than donating (eg. recycling fees)
      • charities who could benefit from donated equipment will lose-out as the
        equipment is being sent for re-cycling instead.

      Issues relating to proprietary software and company/personal files also apply
      to recycling as the equipment could be taken home by someone at the
      recycling depot.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

     Note to examiners.
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of voice over internet protocol (VOIP).                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • communication using internet / internet applications / one example such
                     as Skype, Zoom, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, etc.
                   • communication carried out using the internet
                   • may take the form of voice or multimedia
                   • communication / conferencing with many people at the same time
                   • communication is synchronous / transmitted in real time.

                   Award [1] mark for identifying each characteristic of voice over internet
                   protocol (VOIP) up to a maximum of [2] marks.

           (ii)    Identify the steps that Dr Schultz must follow to list only the surgeries carried
                   out by Dr Tirbau using the spreadsheet software.                                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • set/select/filter the Doctor field/column to show only “Dr Tirbau”
                   • set/select/filter the Procedures field/column to show only “Surgery”.

                   Award [1] for identifying each of the steps followed by Dr Schultz in the
                   spreadsheet software to list only the surgeries done by Dr Tirbau up to a
                   maximum of [2] marks.

           (iii)   Identify two reasons why Dr Schultz would use a spreadsheet instead of a
                   database for record keeping.                                                        [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • spreadsheets are much easier to set up than databases and can be set
                     up in-house with no cost for IT expertise (eg. designing
                     tables/forms/reports/setting relationships etc.)
                   • spreadsheets require less staff training whereas databases can be
                     complicated for staff who are not IT literate
                   • the volume of medical data may not necessitate the time and effort
                     required to set up a database
                   • the spreadsheet software may already come as part of the pre-loaded
                     software whereas the database software may not
                   • spreadsheets allow for data analysis (eg. using functions/formulae)
                   • spreadsheets allow for data visualisation (eg. charts, graphs, etc.)
                   • Creating a filter/using “find” to search for information on a spreadsheet is
                     easier than creating a database query.

                   Award [1] mark for identifying each reason why Dr Schultz would use a
                   spreadsheet for the record keeping rather than a database up to a
                   maximum of [2] marks.

(b)   Dr Schultz has arranged to speak to the local authorities in an attempt to get more
      funding for the medical centre. He intends to use presentation software to create a
      slideshow to support this speech. Dr Schultz is aware that many people in the
      audience are annoyed when slideshows are poorly designed.

      Explain three design errors Dr Schultz should avoid when creating his slideshow
      for the local authorities.                                                            [6]

      Answers may include:

      Small font size / too much text / inappropriate fonts:
      • Dr Schultz should avoid using a small font which makes the text difficult to
        read
      • or results in too much text on a slide reducing its effectiveness
      • some fonts may be difficult to read (e.g. “handwriting” fonts) or give an
        unprofessional impression (e.g. Comic Sans, ‘novelty’ fonts etc.)
      • text that extends to the very edges of the slide can be difficult to read or not
        visible/cropped when the slides are displayed.

      Too many different fonts on a slide:
      • can make it hard for the audience to easily move through the content
      • three or fewer fonts are ideal

      Excessive/inappropriate transitions:
      • Dr Schultz should ensure that the nature of the transition between slides is
        appropriate for the audience
      • he should avoid excessive animations (flying in, etc.) on slides.

      Too many slides:
      • too many slides can mean that the slides do not remain visible long enough for
        the audience to engage with them
      • or the key points associated with each slide become blurred in the overall
        message.

      Poor choice of colours:
      • Dr Schultz needs to ensure the mix of colours makes the slides easy to read
      • therefore, may want to avoid certain combinations such as red or green that
        may cause some of the audience difficulty in reading the information (e.g. the
        combination of font and background colour etc.).

      Inappropriate language:
      • Dr Schultz should ensure the language used is appropriate for the intended
         audience
      • this should ensure that overly complex terms or specialist medical terminology
         are not used.

Inappropriate use of images / multimedia:
• it may be appropriate to incorporate a video (eg interview with a patient)
• but irrelevant music/videos can be annoying and detract from the message
• underuse of images/visuals can detract from the impact of the slideshow
• overuse of irrelevant/inappropriate images/visuals can be annoying and
   detract from the message
• use of images of poor technical quality (eg. pixelated, distorted etc.)
• use of images with visible watermarks/copyright notices detracts from the
   quality of the presentation.

Inconsistent formatting from slide to slide:
 • the presentation is not unified
 • can be distracting as people begin to pay more attention to the formatting than
   the talk.

N.B. the response requires an identification of a common design error followed
by an explanation of why it is a problem. If no design error is mentioned but from
the explanation it can be determined this should be credited.

Award [1] mark for identifying a common design error and [1] mark for an
explanation why it is a problem up to a maximum of [2] marks.

Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

(c)   The Okavango Medical Center has received additional funding from the local
      authority. The centre is investigating the possibility of using these funds to purchase
      IT equipment that would allow surgeons in Gaborone to carry out surgery remotely.

      Evaluate the impact of the purchase of this IT equipment on the medical centre and
      its patients.                                                                      [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of purchasing more IT equipment so that operations can be
      carried out remotely:
      • specialized surgeries (eg, cardiac) can be done remotely/no need for
        specialists to travel to the medical centre
      • adding specialist surgeons to this type of clinic would be expensive and
        inefficient as there would be a limited number of cases for them
      • the doctors in Okavango could assist in and/or observe the surgery, thus
        improving their general surgical skills
      • can improve the outcome for the patient as lifesaving surgery will be
        performed sooner that if the patient was transported to Gaborone
      • increase in the number of patients who can receive medical surgeries who
        may not be able to be transported to Gaborone.

      Disadvantages of purchasing more IT equipment so that operations can be
      carried out remotely:
      • the internet connection may not be sufficient to support remote controlled
         surgery because the surgery requires high-tech video and phone links
      • latency in the connection is also a safety issue. Lag times can cause serious
         errors
      • the remote surgery equipment may not be used frequently enough to justify
         the expense
      • it might be wiser to spend the money on other medical needs
      • patients in the area might be uncomfortable with the idea of a
         remote-controlled robot
      • the data will need to be encrypted to protect patient privacy
      • robotic surgery would use public networks raising security concerns including
         hacking
      • doctors at the clinic will needed to be trained to use this equipment which
         might be expensive/might require that they take time from their clinical work
      • if something goes wrong during the surgery, there may not be suitably
         qualified personnel to assist the patient.
      • IT staff will need to be hired to maintain the robot as well as take care of the
         internet connection/additional cost.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

     Note to examiners.
     • All part (a) and part (b) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where
       appropriate
     • Part (c) is marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to provide
       a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.                     [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • there is no central administrator
                  • all users of the network have the same importance
                  • each computer acts as both client and server / there is no main server
                  • each computer can exchange files directly with every other computer on
                    the network.

                  Award [1] mark for identifying each characteristic of a peer-to-peer network
                  up to a maximum of [2] marks.

           (ii)   Identify two characteristics of a strong password.                                [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • sufficient length (usually more than six characters)
                  • made up of a mixture of letters, numbers and symbols
                  • uses upper and lower case characters
                  • not a dictionary word/common word
                  • not based on personal information (e.g. name, birth date etc.) (i.e. can’t
                    be guessed).

                  Award [1] mark for identifying each characteristic of a strong password up to a
                  maximum of [2] marks.

(iii)   The use of a password is one method of authentication.

        Identify two other methods of authentication.                                 [2]

        Answers may include:
        • biometric authentication
        • fingerprint
        • palm print
        • palm vein
        • facial recognition
        • voice recognition

        • one-time code ie. contact user via phone/sms/email to provide the code,
        • asking user to provide answers to security questions set-up when
          creating an account (eg. what was the first school you attended...?)

        Note for examiners: Award [1] mark for any of the above bullet points up to

(b)   (i)     Explain one reason why Bitcoin makes use of private key and public key
              encryption.                                                                      [2]

              Answers may include:
              • secure because every Bitcoin address has a matching private key
                (saved in the wallet file) of user
              • private keys can be kept in computer files
              • secure because it is impossible to determine a private key from
                corresponding public key
              • public keys can be published and used to communicate securely with
                the user.

              Award [1] for the reason identified and an additional [1] for the explanation
              why Bitcoin uses private key and public key encryption up to a maximum of
              [2] marks.

      (ii)    Explain one reason why it may be difficult to ensure the security of
              information in a large peer-to-peer network such as Bitcoin.                     [2]

              Answers may include:
              • the security may be carried out at the level of the individual user (a large
                network has many potential targets for a cyber-attack). This may mean
                that the network’s security may only be as strong as the weakest link
              • there is no central control which manages the security of each computer
                by providing virus protection/firewall
              • an inexperienced user may unintentionally allow access to his whole
                hard drive instead of allowing access to specific folders
              • users may compromise security by sending password information etc.
                through unencrypted messaging systems.

              Award [1] for the reason why the security of information may be difficult to
              maintain in a large peer-to-peer network such as Bitcoin and an additional [1]
              for the explanation up to a maximum of [2].

      (iii)   Some users of Bitcoins are concerned that their anonymity may be
              compromised by their Bitcoin address.

              Explain one way the Bitcoin address may be used to reveal information
              about a Bitcoin user.                                                            [2]

              Answers may include:
              • the Bitcoin address when transmitted may include additional information,
                such as the IP address of the user’s device
              • this information may be aggregated from a number of sources and this
                larger data set will then provide sufficient information to link the Bitcoin
                address to a person’s identity
              • Bitcoin addresses may be able to be associated with personal details
                stored as part of other transactions using the same Bitcoin address or
                from the same IP address (e.g. a delivery location for a physical item
                purchased using Bitcoin).

              Award [1] for identifying how the Bitcoin address may be used to reveal the
              name of a Bitcoin user and an additional [1] for the explanation up to a
              maximum of [2] marks.

(c)   Bitcoin is a form of digital currency. Bitcoin transactions are made between
      individuals without the knowledge of banks, governments or credit card companies.
      Some governments are investigating whether they should regulate digital
      transactions, such as those made using Bitcoins.

      To what extent is it appropriate for governments to regulate digital transactions,
      such as those made using Bitcoins?                                                         [8]

      Answers may include:
      • if transactions can be done without disclosing the name of the individuals, it could
        be a way to use money obtained illegally (money laundering)
      • governments will not be able to see all commercial transactions and therefore miss
        the possibility to tax commercial activities – informality
      • bitcoin wallet providers may have an agreement with clients not to disclose
        information – privacy invasion
      • it is also possible to send a payment without revealing your identity. This allows
        people to transfer funds across country borders without cost but also allows users to
        buy illegal products anonymously
      • unregulated services such as Bitcoin do not provide the protection of regulated
        services such as banks
      • for governments to be able to forecast financial trends they need to have all of the
        information available. If some information is withheld, this makes forecasting more
        problematic
      • there is the ongoing debate between the privacy/surveillance of the user versus the
        security of the state. The questions could be reframed as what is an acceptable
        level of regulation?
      • if regulation is too strict it will stifle innovation and may prevent worthwhile
        developments in digital currency
      • different degrees of regulation by governments of different countries could create an
        ‘uneven playing field’ for digital currency transactions
      • as Bitcoin is worldwide, regulation could also impact the rights of people outside the
        government’s jurisdiction.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

4.   Implementation of a new information system

     Note to examiners.
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify four ways that TecniCo could gather data about the present
                  situation.                                                                    [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • direct observation of business operations to identify data needed about
                    requests, sales, products offered, clients
                  • interview key stakeholders (business owner, employees and customers)
                  • use questionnaires to survey key stakeholders (business owner,
                    employees and customers)
                  • analyse the current system/documentation to understand how records
                    are kept.

                  Award [1] mark for identifying each way that TecniCo could gather data
                  about the present situation up to a maximum of [4] marks.

           (ii)   TecniCo will provide a list of requirements for the solution proposed.

                  Identify two categories of information that should be included in the
                  requirements specification provided by TecniCo.                               [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • system interaction
                  • input and output requirements
                  • processing requirements
                  • security requirements
                  • specific performance criteria
                  • IT system requirements (hardware and software).

                  Award [1] mark for identifying each category of information that should be
                  included in the requirements specification provided by TecniCo up to a
                  maximum of [2] marks.

(b)       The managers at TecniCo need to decide whether to use open source or proprietary
          software to develop the new information system for Savoree.

          Analyse these two options.                                                                [6]

          Answers may include:

          Using open source software:
          • it is essentially free
          • the open source community is very active and is continually making updates
            which may be a more efficient mechanism than the staged releases by many
            proprietary software companies
          • the open source community may be able to respond more effectively to
            requests for assistance if there are problems/queries with the software
            because a large number of people are working on the problem ie the problem
            is crowd sourced. But that means selecting open source software with a large
            community of users
          • the open source software may be more easily adapted to the end user’s
            requirements rather than the commercial considerations of a developer of
            proprietary software
          • users of open source software must find out about updates and apply them
          • open source software may be more secure as the open source community has
            an opportunity to test the code and suggest security improvements.

          Using proprietary software:
          • a proprietary software includes safeguards such as guarantees and warranties
          • companies that provide proprietary software generally provide frequent
            security updates
          • proprietary software is created by a company that has a vested interest in
            keeping its product secure
          • the software is usually part of an integrated platform which means that it
            should operate with other software as this would have been tested in the
            development phase
          • the user interface may be better as the software is considered as part of a
            whole package
          • may have a greater range of features/options than open-source software.

(c)   Savoree is looking to expand its business. To make this possible, Savoree is
      considering whether to open an online shop. Customers will be able to see products
      and make online purchases.

      Discuss whether Savoree should provide an online shop as a way to expand its
      business.                                                                            [8]

      Answers may include:
      • the online market may offer new opportunities and open up new markets for
        Savoree
      • it may be possible to purchase an online shop relatively easily so the
        investment may pay for itself very quickly
      • the development of an online presence may require additional costs that are
        not recouped by the increased sales
      • the online shop may be based on a generic profile and may not be appropriate
        for Savoree
      • the online shop may be programmed in English and will need to be translated
        into Spanish
      • the move to increase customers may need investment in a new shop which
        may not make the expansion into online sales cost-effective. Someone in the
        company would need to be responsible for updating the site (new
        prices/specials) – training implications
      • the company may be held responsible for the security of customers’ stored
        data (eg. credit card information etc.) - training/hiring implications
      • sales, promotions, new products can be easily shared via the website
      • customer feedback is possible on a website and good feedback is the best
        advertisement for a business.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
