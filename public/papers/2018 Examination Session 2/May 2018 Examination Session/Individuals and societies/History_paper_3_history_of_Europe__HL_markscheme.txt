Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   Discuss the significance of the Domesday Book to the consolidation of Norman authority in
     England.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the significance of the
     Domesday Book to the consolidation of Norman authority in England. There are several reasons
     for Domesday including consolidating and defining changes in land tenure that had occurred in the
     years since 1066. The aim was to resolve disputes between Normans and Anglo-Saxons. An
     additional purpose was to clarify rights and dues that were owed to the monarchy by landholders
     and to ensure the efficient collection of taxes. More immediately it would give a clear picture of the
     resources of the barons, which William could call on to help repel the threatened invasion from
     Denmark. In the longer term, the Domesday Book helped to embed the feudal structure more
     effectively and laid the basis for the continuing authority of the Norman kings in England.


2.   “Philip II (Philip Augustus) was a more effective ruler than Louis VII.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the assessment that Philip II was a
     more effective ruler than his predecessor. Candidates may adopt a comparative approach or deal
     with each ruler sequentially. Both kings sought to reduce the power of their vassals although, and
     arguably, Philip was more successful in this area, with other rulers such as Henry II and the
     princes of Flanders paying him homage. Both were in dispute with the Angevins and again Phillip
     was more successful as he regained Normandy. Louis VII encouraged the construction of royal
     buildings such as Notre Dame and St Denis to enhance the status of the monarchy and Philip
     continued this process. Philip’s administrative reforms and the increasing number of royal officials
     extended his authority. Some may argue that Louis was distracted by his devotion to crusading
     from effectively ruling France.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   Discuss the reasons for, and the results of, religious coexistence in Spain and/or Sicily.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for and results
     of religious coexistence. They may comment on coexistence between Christians and Muslims and
     Christians and Jews. Candidates may focus on a range of Spanish kingdoms, or they may refer to
     states collectively and assess a range of reasons and consequences. Some candidates may
     argue that tolerance was a tradition of Islam, particularly in Andalus, and had been so since
     conquests in the 8th century. As such, Christians and Muslims—as well as Jews—were
     accustomed to living together harmoniously. This led to the Golden Age of Culture with great
     emphasis on literature, art and architecture, mathematics and science. Some may argue that
     levels of tolerance varied at different periods and in different states. There may be specific
     reference to Reconquista and its impact on religious coexistence.


4.   “The main consequence of persecution was, for the Jews, their segregation from society.” Discuss
     with reference to the period from 1095 to 1492.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the consequences for Jews
     of their persecution in the given period. Candidates may focus on the consequences in individual
     countries, or they may refer to several states collectively and assess the consequences more
     thematically by looking at social, economic and political consequences. Social consequences
     could range from attacks on synagogues to expulsion from the country, as happened in both
     France and England. Further, where the ruling authority was weak Jews were often subject to
     attacks. Economically, the consequences could include loss of property when they were expelled,
     paying higher taxes or the loss of income as it became difficult for them to act as money lenders.
     Some may argue that the dominance of Christian doctrine contributed to their segregation from
     society and encouraged persecution.

Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Evaluate the reasons for the overthrow of Richard II in 1399.

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the reasons why Richard II was deposed in 1399
     and weigh up their significance. These may include long-term factors, such as the nature of his
     rule or the war with France. There may be focus on his treatment of nobles, such as Henry
     Bolingbroke. Richard was criticised for his financial extravagance, his favourites, his marriage to
     Isabella and the peace with France. He had difficult relations with Parliament and was unpopular
     because of his imposition of arbitrary fines. His treatment of the Lords Appellant and later his
     seizure of Bolingbroke’s Lancastrian inheritance alienated many of the nobility. Some may argue
     that despite his unpopularity his deposition was a consequence of military failure in Ireland, others
     that the deposition occurred because the nobility encouraged Bolingbroke to take the throne.


6.   “The Wars of the Roses were the most significant challenge to royal authority in 15th-century
     England.” Discuss.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the challenges to royal
     authority in the 15th century and how significant they were. Candidates may focus on the
     instability that was a consequence of the various stages/conflicts of the Wars. Candidates may
     challenge the statement by referring to other challenges, such as “overmighty subjects”, the
     personalities and strengths of various monarchs, and questionable claims to the throne. There
     may be some comparison of the weak rule of Henry VI—because of his illness—and the
     maintenance of royal authority in the second reign of Edward IV. This may lead to the view that
     the Wars were the consequence of weak royal authority not a challenge in themselves. This could
     be further supported by examining the decline of royal authority in the years 1483–1485, which led
     to the last stages of the wars and the establishment of the Tudor dynasty.
                                                – 10 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Evaluate the significance of the patronage of Lorenzo de Medici and Ludovico Sforza in the
     development of the Italian Renaissance.

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the role and significance that the patronage of
     both Lorenzo de Medici and Ludovico Sforza had on the Renaissance. There are several ways in
     which they were significant, including support for artists, the commissions they gave, the range of
     artists and activities they supported and the time and impact of their influence on the Renaissance
     overall. Some may argue that Lorenzo was of more significance by referring to the “Golden Age of
     Lorenzo”, others that he did not commission much work but ensured artists found patrons. He
     extended the Medici Library and supported the spread of intellectual ideas. Sforza also provided
     an environment in which artists flourished encouraged by his wife. He supported the building of
     Milan Cathedral and universities in Pavia and Milan. Critical commentary should be linked to the
     “development” of the Renaissance.


8.   Evaluate the spread of the Renaissance in one European country (other than Italy, Germany and
     Burgundy).

     Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the impact of the Renaissance on their chosen
     country. A range of topics could be addressed, including art and architecture, and the emergence
     of rulers as patrons of the arts as had happened in Italy. There may be reference to the
     Renaissance as a stimulus to intellectual activity focused on philosophy, literature and the
     sciences. Some may argue that the ideas of humanism and the work of Erasmus contributed to
     the Reformation and therefore there was a significant impact. However, it could be argued that in
     art and architecture the Renaissance made limited inroads in some countries, with Gothic influence
     continuing in the arts. Nevertheless, the influence of the Italian Renaissance was significant, for
     example in France during the reign of Francis I.

Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    “Religion was the most important motive for the Portuguese voyages of discovery.” Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of religion as
      a stimulus for the Portuguese voyages of discovery. Candidates may focus on a range of voyages
      individually, or they may refer to several voyages collectively. There must be an assessment of a
      range of other factors. In agreeing with the statement, there may be some discussion of the
      perceived threat from Islam and the desire to find Christian allies in Africa and Asia to help combat
      the challenge. It may also be suggested that the crusading ideal was still present. Individuals
      such as Henry the Navigator were important in encouraging voyages but it may be argued that as
      a convinced Christian he had a religious motivation. A key motive may arguably have been the
      search for resources such as gold (Portugal had limited resources), but also to increase Portugal’s
      stature as a European power.


10.   With reference to the period up to 1550, evaluate the economic impact on Europe of the voyages
      of exploration.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the economic impact of the voyages of exploration on Europe
      up to c.1550. Candidates may use a chronological approach or a comparative approach. The
      evaluation of the impact of the voyages may include the shift of economic power from the
      Mediterranean to the Iberian Peninsula, with the growth of major cities in Spain and Portugal as
      well as other cities such as Antwerp, which handled much of the trade in northern Europe. The
      influence of bullion and its impact on the general price rise is a much-debated point. Spain was
      certainly hit hard and the arrival of gold and silver from the New World has been blamed for
      inflation. It might be argued that the impact of bullion was variable across Europe and not
      everywhere was affected in the same way, suggesting the impact might have been limited and the
      changes were due to other issues.

Section 6: The Reformation (1517–1572)

11.   “The religious ideas of Luther did not have a long-lasting impact on Europe.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement. They may agree that
      Luther had a substantial short-term impact but question his long-term impact. Candidates may
      deal with issues chronologically or thematically. In terms of establishing Lutheranism as a faith,
      Luther did not act alone; Lutheranism was reliant on others for its systematization and spread. His
      dispute with the Church meant that Luther had a religious, political, social and cultural impact on
      Europe. However, while the early years of his dispute caused a storm, his reforms were moderate
      and his faith did not spread far beyond Germany and Scandinavia. Furthermore, the actions of the
      princes became significant after the Diet of Speyer (1529). It may be argued that other reformers,
      such as Calvin had a more significant long-term impact, Calvin’s ideas were more widespread,
      infiltrating France, the Netherlands and Scotland.


12.   Evaluate the reasons for the Peasants’ War in Germany.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons why the Peasants’ War broke out in Germany in
      1525. There were several reasons for the war that could include economic and/or social factors,
      the peasants’ interpretation of the religious ideas of Luther, and the condition of the Church,
      especially over the issue of tithes and the power of the clerical hierarchy. The Peasants’ War
      lacked unity and central control and therefore it might be argued that the reasons for peasant
      involvement varied considerably from area to area. It could be seen as a spontaneous, not
      centrally organized revolt. There has been some focus on the social and economic motives of the
      peasants, with some suggesting that it was due to class conflict, with a clash between the old
      feudal aristocracy and an emerging bourgeois class.
                                                 – 13 –               M18/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Compare and contrast the impact of the policies of any two Enlightened despots.

      Candidates are required to give an account of the similarities and differences of the impact of the
      policies of any two Enlightened Despots referring to both despots throughout. Suitable rulers could
      include: Frederick II of Prussia, Peter I or Catherine II of Russia and Maria Theresa or Joseph II,
      both of whom were rulers of the Holy Roman Empire. It is not a requirement that they be from
      different countries. Many of these Enlightened despots pursued policies to strengthen their state.
      These could include administrative reform, religious toleration and economic development as well
      as military reforms. Other areas of comparison and contrast could include their relationship with
      the nobility and their attitude to serfdom. It could be argued that the actual impact was often
      limited as far as the lives of ordinary people were concerned as enlightened despots were not
      prepared to countenance any reforms that would challenge their rule.


14.   Evaluate the impact of the Baroque movement on the arts between 1650 and 1800.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the impact of the Baroque movement on the arts
      during the period from 1650 to 1800. The arts may include music, architecture (both religious and
      secular), painting and sculpture. When evaluating the Baroque movement some discussion of its
      origins might be appropriate but the focus should be on impact. There may be some discussion of
      the geographical reach of the movement as it was largely confined to Catholic Europe although
      there was some impact in England, especially in architecture. On the other hand, the movement
      had limited impact in France because of its strong classical tradition. It is arguable that the
      consequences of the Baroque movement in music were some of the most long lasting with
      reference being made to the development of opera in Italy or the impact of Bach and Handel in
      Germany.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon (1774–1815)

15.   “The French Revolution was caused by financial and economic challenges”. To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that it was financial
      and economic problems that caused the French Revolution. Candidates may examine the role of
      financial and economic factors in the outbreak of the Revolution together or separately. They may
      examine the role of these factors in the short, medium or long term. They should also consider the
      role of other factors such as the social disparity of the Ancien Régime, the impact of Enlightenment
      ideas and the errors of Louis XVI especially in the period from 1789. They may argue that the
      various factors were interrelated. Candidates may choose to define the Revolution as the storming
      of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 or they may focus more broadly on the range of events from the fall
      of the Bastille to the execution of Louis XVI in January 1793.


16.   Evaluate the success of the Directory (1795–1799) in bringing stability to France.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of how successful the Directory was in bringing
      stability to France between November 1795 and November 1799. Stability could be interpreted as
      political and economic stability. Candidates may argue that it was initially successful, but ultimately
      a failure and easily overthrown. Areas to consider could include: the levels of political violence and
      repression, the extent of opposition to the Directory and the extent of economic stability. In the
      early stages the economy was more stable but towards the end, the levels of corruption and
      inflation created opposition. Candidates could argue that the Directory did not provide stability.
      The five Directors were a weak executive with little control of resources and unable to enforce their
      decisions, with the bicameral legislature, the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients
      arguably holding greater sway with its power to appoint Directors.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   Discuss the reasons for the Bourbon Restoration in France.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of why the Bourbons were
      restored in France. Both Restorations may be discussed; that of 1814 and the second, definitive
      restoration of Louis XVIII after Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo. Some focus could be on explaining
      the reasons for the end of Napoleon’s rule, such as Allied determination to defeat Napoleon and
      his loss of support at home after years of warfare. However, the focus should be on why the
      Bourbons replaced him. Reasons could include Allied support, as they feared another republic, or
      that the Bourbons were seen as legitimate rulers by the Allies and in many regions and classes
      within France. Louis XVIII was careful to announce relatively moderate policies such as freedom
      of religion. The promise of some press freedom and an elected legislature and no restoration of
      property allowed moderates to be reconciled to a Bourbon Restoration.


18.   “Napoleon III’s foreign policy had more successes than failures.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Napoleon III’s foreign
      policy was, by and large, successful. One approach could be to argue that his foreign policy was
      successful in the early years of his reign—perhaps until 1859—but that it had many more failures
      than successes in the 1860s. These led to the defeat by Prussia in 1870, which ended Napoleon
      III’s rule. The focus of the response could be on the position of France on the European stage (the
      Paris Peace Conference 1856), and on his relations with other powers such as Britain (making
      trade treaties), Austria (problems over Mexico) and with Prussia (the rise of which he was unable
      to prevent). Some may argue that his policy in Italy was successful with victories at Magenta and
      Solferino and the acquisition of Nice and Savoy for France.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Discuss the reasons for, and the consequences of, the Repeal of the Corn Laws (1846).

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for and the
      consequences of the repeal of the Corn Laws. There may be some imbalance between reasons
      and consequences of repeal, but both should be discussed. Reasons could include long-standing
      criticism of the Corn Laws because they protected the interests of landowners and made food
      expensive, and the Irish Famine (1845) that highlighted this and gave the Anti Corn Law League
      impetus. Another reason was the determination of Peel to repeal the laws despite opposition in his
      party. The consequences were a reduction in the price of bread and, in the longer term, questions
      about the role of agriculture in the economy. The political consequences were also significant; the
      Conservatives split, with Peel and his followers leaving the Party. The Conservatives were unable
      to win a parliamentary majority until 1874.


20.   Evaluate the reasons why Gladstone was unable to resolve the Irish Question.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the main reasons for Gladstone’s failure to
      resolve the Irish Question. Candidates could begin in 1868, with his first ministry and continue up
      until 1894 when he retired at the end of his fourth ministry (following the failure of his Second
      Home Rule Bill). Candidates may adopt a chronological or a thematic approach. There may be
      discussion of his different approaches, ranging from reform (the various Land Acts and the
      Disestablishment of the Irish Church) and later attempts to solve the problem via Home Rule and
      the use of coercion. Responses are also likely to focus on opposition to Home Rule in Parliament
      both in the Liberal and Conservative Parties and in the Lords. Public opinion was also
      unsympathetic to Home Rule because of violence (Phoenix Park Murders) and the question of
      Ulster.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   Evaluate the importance of foreign influence in the unification of Italy.

      Candidates are required to appraise the contribution of foreign powers to the unification of Italy.
      Candidates may appraise the importance of the role of foreign powers as compared with other
      factors in achieving unification. The impact of France is also likely to be a focus, from the support
      of Napoleon III in the partial unification by 1861 but also the presence of a French garrison in
      Rome preventing full unification. Other powers involved—either positively or negatively—include
      Austria and Prussia. There are arguments against the primacy of foreign powers in the unification
      of Italy, these include the importance of Cavour, who helped to develop Piedmont as a liberal state
      that Italian nationalists could support, and the activities of Garibaldi in increasing the size of the
      new Italian state.


22.   Evaluate the contribution of economic and military factors to the rise of Prussia during the period
      from 1815 to 1866.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the contribution of both issues to the rise of Prussia;
      however, the treatment of each need not be equal. Economic factors could include the role of the
      Zollverein, Bismarck’s polices to strengthen the Prussian economy, and the weakness of the
      Austrian economy. Military factors could include military reforms in Prussia and victory in the
      various wars, which contrasted with Austria’s military weakness (defeat in Italy and in 1866).
      Candidates could challenge the question, arguing that factors other than those relating to the
      military and economy were important in the rise of Prussia. They could stress the importance of
      political leadership. For example, Austrian political leadership was not entirely focused on
      Germany and rivalry with Prussia, instead looking to protect Austria’s Italian possessions.
      Bismarck, however, was clearly focused on strengthening Prussia within Germany.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union
                (1855–1924)

23.   “Russia’s participation in the First World War was the main cause of the February/March 1917
      Revolution.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the statement. Some may choose
      to argue that it was the impact of the war on society and the economy that led to revolution.
      Others that there were long-term underlying problems that made revolution likely; that the impact of
      war was merely as a catalyst for revolution. There may be some assessment of pre-war conditions
      including the relative stability of the monarchy, levels of discontent and attitudes to the war. There
      may also be assessment of the problems caused by military defeats (Tannenburg and the
      Masurian Lakes), high casualty rates and the economic impact of the war. The Tsar’s decision to
      command the army, as well as the issue of Rasputin, contributed to the increasing unpopularity of
      the monarchy. The events of February/March 1917 in Petrograd, the Bread Riots, strikes and the
      actions of the Petrograd garrison may all be linked to the war.


24.   “Lenin’s foreign relations were motivated by practical concerns and not ideology.” Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the statement. They should
      identify the practical problems Lenin faced that shaped his foreign relations. There should also be
      some discussion of his Marxist ideology and the goal of world revolution and its impact on foreign
      relations. The attitude of other powers to Soviet Russia could also be relevant. Practical policies
      may include the signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the treaty of Riga (1921), recognition of the
      independence of the Baltic States and Finland, and the Treaty of Rapallo (1922). These were all a
      consequence of Russian weakness. The trade agreements with Britain and Germany were a
      practical solution to restore the Russian economy. Ideologically driven policies could include the
      Russo-Polish war and the establishment of Comintern, as both were concerned with spreading
      communism. Some may argue that in the long term, Lenin was committed to world revolution.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   To what extent was Balkan nationalism a significant cause of the First World War?

      Candidates are required to consider the view that Balkan nationalism was a major cause of war.
      While other factors will be considered to provide context, the focus of the response must be on
      Balkan nationalism. When discussing this issue, candidates may refer to the long-term decline of
      the Ottoman Empire leading to nationalist aspirations and resentment of Austro–Hungarian rule in
      Bosnia–Herzegovina, which eventually contributed to the outbreak of war. On the other hand,
      candidates could also argue that the impact of Balkan nationalism could have been limited to a
      possible third Balkan War if other factors had not intervened. Other factors that turned a Balkan
      conflict into a wider war may include the alliance system, the “blank cheque”, Russia’s decision to
      mobilize and, arguably, Britain’s failure to clarify its position if Germany attacked France. Some
      may argue that German nationalism was more significant than Balkan nationalism.


26.   With reference to the period up to 1918, discuss the reasons for, and the impact of, US entry into
      the First World War.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for and
      significance of US entry into the war. The may be some imbalance but both elements should be
      discussed. Reasons for may include unrestricted submarine warfare, the Zimmerman Telegram,
      inclination of the US to enter the war on the side of Britain and France, and events in Russia, which
      made it possible to describe the war as a “fight for democracy”. When considering the significance
      of US entry arguments may vary. Some will argue the impact of fresh US troops led to Allied
      victory, while others could stress the contribution in military supplies and financial support, arguing
      that the military significance of US troops was limited. It may be argued that other factors, such as
      Germany’s weak allies, the naval blockade and Allied victories in 1918 (Amiens) had a greater
      impact on the outcome of the war.

Section 14: European states in the inter-war years (1918–1939)

27.   “Hitler’s consolidation of power between January 1933 and August 1934 was a political revolution.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the statement. Candidates should
      consider the extent of change to the political structure from the Weimar period—or even from
      Imperial Germany—and whether there was some continuity. Candidates may choose to address
      continuity and change discretely or chronologically. Some may argue that the dictatorship
      established in August 1934 was a complete change from Weimar’s liberal, democratic, federalist
      constitution. Others that the regime had similarities to Imperial Germany, with one dominant
      authoritarian figure as head of state or that parliamentary democracy had already collapsed
      between 1930 and 1933. Analysis of factors such as the Enabling Bill, the policy of
      Gleichschaltung, the position of Trade Unions, the establishment of the one-party state as well as
      the Night of the Long Knives and Hitler becoming Fuhrer should be linked to the concept of change
      (revolution).


28.   Evaluate the importance of economic and political problems in allowing Mussolini to gain power in
      Italy in 1922.

      Candidates are required to appraise the relative importance of economic and political weakness in
      undermining the Liberal state in Italy and their contribution to Mussolini’s appointment as prime
      minister in October 1922. Other factors such as fear of revolution (Biennio Rossi) or Italian
      nationalism (the mutilated victory) may be considered to provide context for the evaluation of the
      importance of economic and political problems. There may be some imbalance in the treatment of
      economic factors (unemployment and post-war recession) and political factors (transformismo,
      leading to weak government). Candidates may argue that it was the underlying weakness of
      political institutions, combined with post-war problems, that weakened the Liberal state. Others
      may argue that it was Mussolini’s opportunism and significant popular support that allowed him to
      take advantage of the situation, or that the combination of factors led to him gaining power in 1922.

Section 15: Versailles to Berlin: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   “The Treaty of Versailles was a harsh and unfair peace.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Candidates will consider of the merits or otherwise of the statement; they may support it or argue
      against it, or they may choose a position somewhere in between. Posterity has not been
      favourable to the Treaty of Versailles, and candidates may address how judgments of the treaty
      are affected by how much Germany was negatively affected following the ratification of Versailles
      in July 1919. However, this is not a “rise of Hitler question” and candidates must not use it thus.
      Candidates may argue that the treaty was not unfair, referring to the fact that Germany had
      requested an armistice (thereby admitting defeat), but also remained a major European power after
      ratification. Some discussion of the significance of Wilson’s Fourteen Points as a basis for
      negotiation would be relevant, along with the aims of the peacemakers. Comparison with the
      Treaty of Brest-Litovsk could also be relevant.


30.   Discuss the reasons for the failure of the League of Nations by 1938.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the League’s weakness
      by 1938. Candidates may adopt a chronological or thematic approach. Some may argue that the
      League was undermined from the outset or that world events during the 1930s overwhelmed it.
      Areas for discussion could include: the membership of the League, with several important powers
      not joining or leaving it at key points. Slow decision-making processes may also be discussed, as
      well as the fact that the League was often bypassed, thus undermining its effectiveness
      (Conference of Ambassadors). The League’s weak response to various crises and the reasons for
      this could also be discussed. Candidates may argue that the League was designed to function
      effectively in an international context that sought peace, but that the 1930s were too unstable and
      too dominated by aggressive powers for it to be effective.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   Discuss the causes and consequences of Stalin’s purges up to 1953.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for and the
      impact of the various purges in Russia. The focus is likely to be on the purges of the 1930s,
      although some candidates may mention the post-Second World War period up until 1953.
      Candidates may refer to different historical interpretations of the purges. Some historians argue
      that purges were used to maintain Stalin’s power, others that the purges were a traditional Russian
      response to threats. Others still, argue that the NKVD and the Party in local areas spiralled out of
      control. Consequences could include the weakening of the Soviet armed forces and the fact that
      Stalin remained unchallenged as ruler until his death. For the wider population, the consequences
      were that millions suffered and a society that feared to question the party developed.


32.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of Khrushchev and Brezhnev.

      Candidates are required to give an account of the similarities and differences of the domestic
      policies of both leaders, referring to both leaders throughout. They may consider the nature of and
      impact on the Soviet Union of the leaders’ domestic policies, identifying a broad difference in
      approach, or they could argue that apparent differences were a matter of detail within the Soviet
      Union. Areas for discussion could be the impact of policies on living standards, and their policies
      on agriculture. The position of the Party and levels of repression, including attitudes to dissidents,
      may also be discussed. Some may argue that Khrushchev was something of a reformer (de-
      Stalinization) and attempted to change many areas of policy with limited degrees of success. In
      contrast the Brezhnev era was one of stagnation—particularly economic stagnation—and greater
      repression, with limited implementation of the Helsinki Accords and the repression of dissidents.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   With reference to the period up to 1949, evaluate the contribution of economic factors to the
      division of Germany.

      Candidates will provide an appraisal of the relative significance of economic factors in explaining
      the reasons for the division of Germany in 1949. Wartime tensions could be made relevant in
      setting a context, but the focus is post-1945. Economic factors discussed could include: the issue
      of reparations, the establishment of Bizonia and the new Deutschmark. Other factors could include
      tensions over borders (Poland), Stalin’s polices in Eastern Europe, Truman’s policies (Marshall
      Aid), and the significance of the Berlin Blockade (1948/49) in ending the pretence of cooperation
      between the powers. This is not a “causes of the Cold War question” and there should be clear
      links to the division of Germany. Some may argue that Cold War tensions were the main reason
      for the division and that the economic disagreements were secondary consequences.


34.   Discuss the extent of political change in one western or northern European country (other than
      France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain) between 1945 and 2000.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of post-war political changes in
      their chosen country (please note that this does not include any of the former satellite states of the
      Soviet Union). Relevant choices could include Britain, post-reunification Germany, Norway or
      Denmark. Political change can be defined in several ways and responses may focus on
      constitutional change, changes in the political process (universal suffrage) or the impact of societal
      change on politics. They may consider the importance of organizations such as trade unions and
      /or the influence of employers’ organizations on politics. Some candidates may wish to consider
      the effects of membership of the European Union on domestic politics. In the later period the
      emergence—or re-emergence—of far-right parties or the development of issue-based parties such
      as the Greens may be included.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   “Protests against Soviet domination in central and eastern Europe were unsuccessful up to 1980.”
      With reference to East Germany and Poland or Hungary and Czechoslovakia, to what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are required to consider the merits or otherwise of the statement by identifying the
      aims of the various protests and the extent to which those aims were achieved. Protest
      movements in two states must be addressed but allow for some imbalance in their treatment.
      Frequently the protests were linked to living standards and the extent of direct Soviet control and
      repression. Whichever states are chosen, responses should address the extent of change,
      evidence of which may include the existence of increased trade with the west (Poland and
      Hungary, Czechoslovakia). However, in all cases the Communists remained the dominant party
      and in some cases repression increased (East Germany). Responses may well conclude that
      some protests led to improved living standards and/or the diminution (but not eradication) of direct
      Soviet control.


36.   Compare and contrast the role of Walesa in Poland and Havel in Czechoslovakia.

      Candidates will identify the similarities and differences in the significance and actions of the two
      men in their respective countries, referring to both men throughout. The focus is likely to be on the
      period leading up to the collapse of the communist regime in each country in 1989; however, there
      should be consideration of their importance in the post-communist period. While both were well
      known internationally, the focus of responses must be on their domestic roles. Areas for
      discussion could include the extent of support for their leadership of opposition movements
      (Walesa had a mass following in Solidarity whereas Havel was considered an intellectual dissident
      with a limited role political role until 1989). Their significance and actions in 1989 could also be
      gauged. In the post-communist era, both became president, although Walesa only served one
      term whereas Havel served two and oversaw the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia.
