1.   (a)   With reference to Table 2, describe two advantages for Su of using a cash-flow
           forecast.                                                                              [4]

           Possible advantages include:
           • it shows when there is expected to be cash shortfall (especially late 2018,
             early 2019)
           • it is suitable for “what if”. For example, if a bigger loan was sought there might
             not be a cash shortfall.

           Any other relevant advantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each advantage identified, and [1] for the development of each of this
           advantage in the context of AS. Award up to a maximum of [2] per advantage.

     (b)   With reference to Su and her managers at HH and AS, explain the differences
           between leadership and management.                                                     [6]

           Su shows distinct leadership qualities. She:
           • inspires
           • sets missions
           • takes responsibility for strategic decisions
           • takes on the role of spokesperson
           • delegates, advises, guides
           • shows features of McGregor Theory Y.

           Her managerial roles are somewhat limited but include organizing at a corporate
           level. Most of the management functions are delegated.

           Managers fulfil management functions including:
           • making day-to-day decisions
           • making tactical decisions
           • organizing resources, directing, coordinating staff.

           Accept any other relevant difference.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of advantages is mainly descriptive,
           but in context.

2.   (a)   With reference to AK Bank, describe two features of for-profit microfinance
           providers.                                                                            [4]

           Features include:
           • they provide small amounts of capital
           • they provide finance to people who might otherwise not get finance (eg, poorer
             people, specific groups such as women)
           • they often help business start-ups
           • they lend to people without collateral
           • they often operate in developing economies.

           Do not reward answers that say “it’s not for profit” and/or “it provides finance”
           unless these are developed.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each correct feature identified and [1] for a description of how that
           feature relates to AK. Award a maximum of [2] per feature.

(b)   Su is considering two possible locations for the production facility (lines 51–52).
      Explain the factors (reasons) that Su may consider when deciding between the two
      locations.                                                                            [6]

      This is not an AO3 question so there does not have to be a recommendation.

      Factors/reasons include:

      For country B:
      • This is a social enterprise, so a developing economy may be important.
      • Distribution could be a problem, so simple transport links are favourable.
      But:
      • One party state may be high risk and seen as unethical.
      • Quality is an issue, so skills are important.

      For Country A:
      • Free market economy, high skills.
      • Trading easier.
      • Stable currency, stable government.
      But:
      • Does it need the work?
      • Costs likely to be higher.
      • Finance not so important so how relevant are grants, low rents?

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] if explanation does not effectively bring out the reasons

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of more than one reasons is mainly
      descriptive, but in context.

      For full marks, the explanation needs to be developed and in context.

3.   (a)   Describe two advantages for AS of using cellular production in the production of
           its solar power systems.                                                              [4]

           • Cellular production relies on team work, which helps motivation. Tasks are
             completed by the team.
           • This could help AS achieve its desired high quality, efficient use of resources,
             reduction of waste.

           Accept any other relevant advantage

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each advantage identified, and [1] for the development of each of
           these advantages in the context of AS, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Explain the advantages for Su of forming AS as a private limited company.             [6]

           Advantages:
           • Limited liability – the business is fairly high risk so Su may need protection of
             her personal finances.
           • Limited number of shareholders – may be important to retain the high ethical
             values.
           • Difficult to takeover – Su will want to keep this project hers.
           • Separate legal entity.
           • Able to raise additional finance without losing control.
           • Continuity assured.

           Accept any other relevant advantage.

4.   (a)   Define the term four-part moving average.                                            [2]

           A four-part moving average is the average of four adjacent terms in a time series.
           The starting point progresses gradually through the time series.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above. All three
           are not needed. Although it is “define”, an example can help.

           Award [2] for a full definition. Award [1] for some understanding of the term.

     (b)   With reference to AS, explain the difference between commercial marketing and
           social marketing of the solar power systems (line 53).                               [4]

           • Commercial marketing focuses on the potential buyers of a product/service.
           • Social marketing considers the effects of the product/service on the whole of
             society.

           For the solar panels, commercial marketing would focus on the customers,
           persuading them to buy the panels in order for AS to make a profit. It would
           attract customers through the benefits and through available finance. Social
           marketing will focus on the benefits the systems have on the Afghan
           communities, in particular poor and remote communities. Social marketing may
           focus on long-term benefits and more general issues such as bringing stability to
           Afghanistan.

           Award a maximum of [2] for a theoretical answer or for an answer that explains
           without drawing out differences.

           Award [4] for an answer that explains one or more difference in context

     (c)   Explain how total quality management (TQM) could help AS improve the quality
           of its products.                                                                     [4]

           Total quality management seeks to ensure the highest quality standards
           throughout a business. AS is having quality issues, in particular with some cells
           performing less well than others. There are problems with the supply chain and
           there are problems with some suppliers. By employing TQM, the whole process
           from supplier to delivery will be reassessed with the aim of zero defects
           throughout.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award a maximum of [4] for an explanation in context.

           For non-contextual answers award a maximum of [2].

(d)   Using information from the case study, additional information from pages 4 and 5
      and appropriate business tools, discuss the value to Su of the force field analysis
      in deciding whether to grow through change.                                            [10]

      Positive benefits:
      • AS needs to make some long-term decisions. FFA will help in the process of
        deciding whether to change or whether to remain the same.
      • The basic question is: should AS remain the same or grow? The subsidiary
        question is how best to grow.
      • Driving forces will support the arguments for growth, whereas restraining
        forces will support staying the same.
      • The driving forces in the table are a useful starting point. How can you
        distinguish between the value of Su’s beliefs and needs with the needs of the
        people in other parts of Asia? How can you compare the team’s needs with
        Su’s?
      • At best scores in the table will be subjective.
      • The FFA helps to clarify thinking, identify the factors involved in the decision
        and point to the issues that need to be balanced. It cannot make the decision
        but can help clarify the issues.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 6.

      Purely theoretical answer or with no effective use of stimulus material in range [3]
      to [4] with better answers award a maximum of [4].

      If discussion is one-sided award a maximum of [5].

      Both sides considered, good use of evidence, particularly from section B, but no
      effective conclusion award a maximum of [8].

      For full marks a fully supported conclusion with good use of evidence, particularly
      from section B.

                                       Section C
5.   Using the case study, additional information on pages 6 and 7 and appropriate
     planning tools, recommend whether Su should choose Option 1, Option 2 or neither.
     You will find it useful to calculate the ARR for Option 1.

     PLEASE ANNOTATE SCRIPTS WHEN CRITERION A IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE
     MARK BOX.

     Marks should be allocated according to the assessment criteria on pages 7–8.
     Note – a recommendation that a decision cannot be made due to lack of information
     (eg, market research) can be regarded as a decision provided the arguments are
     supported.

     Doing nothing:
     • No additional investment.
     • Successful – no need for change.
     • Resistance to change.
     • Su can still manage effectively.
     • Low risk, but will market become saturated?
     But:
     • Missed opportunities.
     • Will Su be satisfied?
     • Businesses will naturally want to grow.
     • Loss of motivational opportunity.

     Joint venture with DF:
     • Big opportunity to have an impact on a wider/larger scale.
     • Positive NPV, good ARR, relatively short payback.
     • Suits Su’s objectives.
     • Risk smaller because of joint venture.
     But:
     • Could be overwhelmed.
     • Restructuring needs.
     • Large investment.
     • Managers lose influence.
     • Demotivating.
     • Possible job losses.
     • Are investment appraisal results realistic eg, 6 % discount rate?

     Biomass:
     • Smaller investment.
     • Retains autonomy.
     • Provides a valuable service to wider community.
     But:
     • Fairly large investment. Source of finance?
     • High risk.
     • Smaller NPV, ARR, larger payback.

     ARR for Option 1:
     The calculation is annual net cash flow/investment x 100.
     The investment is $1m.
     The cash inflow is $0.4m.
     The project takes 5 years. The ARR is ((5 x 0.4) –1) 5/1 x 100 = 20 %

Do not penalize candidates who do not consider the 'do nothing'
option
Criterion A: possible theories, planning tools and techniques include: Investment appraisal,
Management issues such as management of change,, HRM issues such as motivation,, risk
(including Ansoff), joint ventures, production problems, force field analysis, the importance of
assumptions. Planning tools include those in Section 1.7 of the syllabus plus Ansoff and
investment appraisal.

No understanding of investment appraisal max [3]

For [4]: Correct investment appraisal calculation plus at least one other tool, technique or
theory understood and developed well with some relevance to the additional stimulus
material.

For [2]: some understanding of at least two tools, techniques or theories, but not developed.

Criterion B: the tools, techniques, theories and stimulus applied to the decision. Application
will be judged by the use of the stimulus material in particular the extra material especially
Table 4.

For [4]: relevant tools, techniques and theories are applied well to the case study (including
OFR) context and additional stimulus material, the application is convincing and relevant.

If only one option considered max [3].

Limited use of Table 4 max [3].

For [2]: some limited context/application but not developed. Use of tools limits candidate’s
ability to make reasoned arguments.

If a candidate calculates ARR but then does not use it reward can only be made in Criterion
A.

Criterion C: Options discussed in a balanced way, conclusions drawn as to whether they
work. Remember, ‘do nothing’ can be a recommendation.

For [4]: There needs to be a comparison between the two options using Section C and other
material and a recommendation (Option 1, Option 2 or do nothing) made and supported.
For [2]: Only one option considered or some limited arguments but not justified. No
comparison limited analysis but candidate arrives/draws a reasoned conclusion.

Criterion D: Structure. This criterion assesses the extent to which the student organizes his
or her ideas with clarity, and presents a structured piece of writing comprised of:
• an introduction
• logical structure
• a conclusion
• fit-for-purpose paragraphs. This means: not too long, focused on distinct issues,
   sequenced well, guides the reader.
• BEWARE OF UNDER_REWARDING WEAK SCRIPTS WHICH, NONETHELESS, HAVE
   SOME OR ALL OF THE ELEMENTS. The candidate will lose marks in the other criteria
   so they should not be double-penalized.
For [4]: all four elements present, clearly organized and there is clarity in the student’s
answer.
                                                   – 17 –              M18/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



For [2]: No logical structure but other elements present or logical structure with other
elements missing.


Criterion E: Stakeholders:
• individuals: Su, individual households
• groups: Managers, employees, customers, communities, governments, NGOs,
   stakeholders at DF.

For [4]: two or more individuals and groups are considered in a balanced way.

For [2]: one group or individual considered appropriately, or several individuals or groups
considered superficially.
