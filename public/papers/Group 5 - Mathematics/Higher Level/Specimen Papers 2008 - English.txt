Introduction
The assessment model has been changed for May 2008:

•   Paper 1 and paper 2 will both consist of section A, short questions answered on the paper (similar to the
    current paper 1), and section B, extended-response questions answered on answer sheets (similar to the
    current paper 2).

•   Calculators will not be allowed on paper 1.

•   Graphic display calculators (GDCs) will be required on paper 2 and paper 3.

The revised assessment model for external components will be:

Paper 1 (no calculator allowed)        30%          2 hrs

Section A                           60 marks
Compulsory short-response questions based on the compulsory core of the syllabus.

Section B                          60 marks
Compulsory extended-response questions based on the compulsory core of the syllabus.

Paper 2 (calculator required)          30%          2 hrs

Section A                           60 marks
Compulsory short-response questions based on the compulsory core of the syllabus.

Section B                          60 marks
Compulsory extended-response questions based on the compulsory core of the syllabus.

Paper 3 (calculator required)          20%          1 hr

Extended-response questions based mainly on the syllabus options.        60 marks


Full details can be found in the second edition of the mathematics HL guide which was sent to schools in
September 2006 and is available on the online curriculum centre (OCC).


Why are these changes being made?

Experience has shown that certain papers can be answered using the GDC very little, although some students
will answer the same papers by using a GDC on almost every question. We have seen some very interesting
and innovative approaches used by students and teachers, however there have been occasions when the paper
setters wished to assess a particular skill or approach. The fact that candidates had a GDC often meant that it
was difficult (if not impossible) to do this. The problem was exacerbated by the variety of GDCs used by
students worldwide. The examining team feel that a calculator-free environment is needed in order to better
assess certain knowledge and skills.

How will these changes affect the way the course is taught?

Most teachers should not find it necessary to change their teaching in order to be able to comply with the
change in the assessment structure. Rather it will give them the freedom to emphasize the analytical
approach to certain areas of the course that they may have been neglecting somewhat, not because they did
not deem it relevant or even essential, but because it was becoming clear that technology was “taking the
upper hand” and ruling out the need to acquire certain skills.


Are there changes to the syllabus content?

No, it should be emphasized that it is only the assessment model that is being changed. There is no intention
to change the syllabus content. Neither is there any intention to reduce the role of the GDC, either in teaching
or in the examination.

Any references in the subject guide to the use of a GDC will still be valid, for example, finding the inverse of
a 3x3 matrix using a GDC; this means that these will not appear on paper 1. Another example of questions
that will not appear on paper 1 is statistics questions requiring the use of tables. In trigonometry, candidates
are expected to be familiar with the characteristics of the sin, cos and tan curves, their symmetry and periodic
properties, including knowledge of the ratios of 0! ,30! , 45! , 60! ,90! ,180! and how to derive the ratios of
multiples by using the symmetry of the curves, for example, sin 210! = − sin 30! .


What types of questions will be asked on paper 1?

Paper 1 questions will mainly involve analytical approaches to solutions rather than requiring the use of a
GDC. It is not intended to have complicated calculations with the potential for careless errors. However,
questions will include some arithmetical manipulations when they are essential to the development of the
question.


What types of questions will be asked on paper 2?

These questions will be similar to those asked on the current papers. Students must have access to a GDC at
all times, however not all questions will necessarily require the use of the GDC. There will be questions
where a GDC is not needed and others where its use is optional. There will be some questions that cannot be
answered without a GDC that meets the minimum requirements.


What is the purpose of this document?

This document is a combination of the original specimen papers for papers 1 and 2 (published in November
2004) and the new specimen questions for paper 1 (published online in November 2006). It should be noted
that this is not two specimen papers but a collection of questions illustrating the types of questions that may
be asked on each paper. Thus they will not necessarily reflect balanced syllabus coverage, nor the relative
importance of the syllabus topics.

In order to provide teachers with information about the examinations, the rubrics for each paper and section
are included below. In papers 1 and 2 Section A questions should be answered in the spaces provided, and
Section B questions on the answer sheets provided by the IBO. Graph paper should be used if required. The
answer spaces have been included with the first 2 questions of Section A on each paper. Paper 3 has not
changed.

Paper 1
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

Section A
Answer all the questions in the spaces provided. Working may be continued below the lines, if necessary.

Section B
Answer all the questions on the answer sheets provided. Please start each question on a new page.


Paper 2
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is
shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

Markscheme instructions
A.    Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy: often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


B.    Using the markscheme

Follow through (FT) marks: Only award FT marks when a candidate uses an incorrect answer in a
subsequent part. Any exceptions to this will be noted on the markscheme. Follow through marks are now the
exception rather than the rule within a question or part question. Follow through marks may only be awarded
to work that is seen. Do not award N FT marks. If the question becomes much simpler then use discretion to
award fewer marks. If a candidate mis-reads data from the question apply follow-through.

Discretionary (d) marks: There will be rare occasions where the markscheme does not cover the work seen.
In such cases, (d) should used to indicate where an examiner has used discretion. It must be accompanied by
a brief note to explain the decision made.

It is important to understand the difference between “implied” marks, as indicated by the brackets, and
marks which can only be awarded for work seen - no brackets. The implied marks can only be awarded if
correct work is seen or implied in subsequent working. Normally this would be in the next line.

Where M1 A1 are awarded on the same line, this usually means M1 for an attempt to use an appropriate
formula, A1 for correct substitution.

As A marks are normally dependent on the preceding M mark being awarded, it is not possible to award M0
A1.

As N marks are only awarded when there is no working, it is not possible to award a mixture of N and other
marks.

Accept all correct alternative methods, even if not specified in the markscheme Where alternative methods
for complete questions are included, they are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc. Other
alternative (part) solutions, are indicated by EITHER….OR. Where possible, alignment will also be used to
assist examiners to identify where these alternatives start and finish.

Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms. On the markscheme, these equivalent
numerical or algebraic forms will generally be written in brackets after the required answer The markscheme
indicate the required answer, by allocating full marks at that point. Once the correct answer is seen, ignore
further working, unless it contradicts the answer.
                                                         –5–
Brackets will also be used for what could be described as the well-expressed answer, but which candidates may
not write in examinations. Examiners need to be aware that the marks for answers should be awarded for the form
preceding the brackets e.g. in differentiating f ( x) = 2sin (5 x − 3) , the markscheme says

              f ′( x) = ( 2cos (5 x − 3) ) 5   ( = 10cos(5 x − 3) )                     A1

This means that the A1 is awarded for seeing ( 2cos (5 x − 3) ) 5 , although we would normally write the
answer as 10cos(5 x − 3) .

As this is an international examination, all alternative forms of notation should be accepted.

Where the markscheme specifies M2, A3, etc., for an answer do NOT split the marks unless otherwise
instructed.

Do not award full marks for a correct answer, all working must be checked.

Candidates should be penalized once IN THE PAPER for an accuracy error (AP). There are two types of
accuracy error:

    •   Rounding errors: only applies to final answers not to intermediate steps.
    •   Level of accuracy: when this is not specified in the question the general rule is unless otherwise
        stated in the question all numerical answers must be given exactly or to three significant figures.
