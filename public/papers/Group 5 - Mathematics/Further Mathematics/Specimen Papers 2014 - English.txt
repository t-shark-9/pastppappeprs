Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


Using the markscheme

1     General

      Write the marks in red on candidates’ scripts, in the right hand margin.

      ✁ Show the breakdown of individual marks awarded using the abbreviations M1, A1, etc.
      ✁ Write down the total for each question (at the end of the question) and circle it.


2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

      ✁ Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked, and
          marks awarded according to the markscheme.
      ✁   It is not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) are often dependent on the preceding
          M mark.
      ✁   Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, e.g. M1A1, this usually means M1 for an
          attempt to use an appropriate method (e.g. substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the
          correct values.
      ✁   Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc. do not split the marks.
      ✁   Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.

3     N marks

      Award N marks for correct answers where there is no working.

      ✁ Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
      ✁ There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
          penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
                                                 –3–          SPEC/5/FURMA/HP1/ENG/TZX/XX/M


4   Implied marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets e.g. (M1), and can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if
    implied in subsequent working.

    ✁ Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
    ✁ Marks without brackets can only be awarded for work that is seen.

5   Follow through marks

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s). To award FT marks, there must be working present and not
    just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.

    ✁ If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer FT
      marks.
    ✁ If the error leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. sin ✄ 1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
      answer(s).
    ✁ Within a question part, once an error is made, no further dependent A marks can be awarded, but
      M marks may be awarded if appropriate.
    ✁ Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.

6   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). Apply a MR
    penalty of 1 mark to that question. Award the marks as usual and then write –1(MR) next to the total.
    Subtract 1 mark from the total for the question. A candidate should be penalized only once for a
    particular mis-read.

    ✁ If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer
      marks.
    ✁ If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. sin ✄ 1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the
      final answer(s).

7   Discretionary marks (d)

    An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not
    cover the work seen. The mark should be labelled (d) and a brief note written next to the mark
    explaining this decision.

8   Alternative methods

    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
    specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt,
    contact your team leader for advice.

    ✁ Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
    ✁ Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
    ✁ Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
      alternatives start and finish.
                                                            –4–          SPEC/5/FURMA/HP1/ENG/TZX/XX/M


9    Alternative forms

     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

     ✁   As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
     ✁   In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
         brackets immediately following the answer.
     ✁   In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates may not write in examinations), will
         generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the bracket or
         the form in brackets (if it is seen).
     Example: for differentiating f ( x) ✂ 2sin (5 x ☎ 3) , the markscheme gives:

                f ✞ ( x) ✂ ✆ 2 cos (5 x ☎ 3) ✝ 5   ✂ 10cos (5 x ☎ 3) ✄                      A1

     Award A1 for ✟ 2cos (5 x ☎ 3) ✠ 5 , even if 10cos (5 x ☎ 3) is not seen.

10   Accuracy of Answers

     The method of dealing with accuracy errors on a whole paper basis by means of the Accuracy Penalty
     (AP) no longer applies.

     Instructions to examiners about such numerical issues will be provided on a question by question
     basis within the framework of mathematical correctness, numerical understanding and contextual
     appropriateness.

     The rubric on the front page of each question paper is given for the guidance of candidates.
     The markscheme (MS) may contain instructions to examiners in the form of “Accept answers which
     round to n significant figures (sf)”. Where candidates state answers, required by the question, to
     fewer than n sf, award A0. Some intermediate numerical answers may be required by the MS but not
     by the question. In these cases only award the mark(s) if the candidate states the answer exactly or to
     at least 2sf.

11   Crossed out work

     If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
     crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

12   Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 3, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (e.g. TI-89) are
     not allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics HL guide says:
         Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of
     calculator notation in the working.

13   More than one solution

     Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the same question, an examiner should only
     mark the first response unless the candidate indicates otherwise.

            since S lies between any pair of successive partial sums, it follows that S lies

                                       Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


Using the markscheme

1     General

      Write the marks in red on candidates’ scripts, in the right hand margin.

      ✁ Show the breakdown of individual marks awarded using the abbreviations M1, A1, etc.
      ✁ Write down the total for each question (at the end of the question) and circle it.


2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

      ✁ Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked, and
         marks awarded according to the markscheme.
      ✁ It is not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) are often dependent on the preceding
        M mark.
      ✁ Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, e.g. M1A1, this usually means M1 for an
        attempt to use an appropriate method (e.g. substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the
        correct values.
      ✁ Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc. do not split the marks.
      ✁ Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.


3     N marks

      Award N marks for correct answers where there is no working.

      ✁ Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
      ✁ There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
         penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
                                                 –3–          SPEC/5/FURMA/HP2/ENG/TZX/XX/M

4   Implied marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets e.g. (M1), and can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if
    implied in subsequent working.

    ✁ Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
    ✁ Marks without brackets can only be awarded for work that is seen.

5   Follow through marks

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s). To award FT marks, there must be working present and not
    just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.

    ✁ If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer FT
      marks.
    ✁ If the error leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. sin ✄ 1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
      answer(s).
    ✁ Within a question part, once an error is made, no further dependent A marks can be awarded, but
      M marks may be awarded if appropriate.
    ✁ Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.

6   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). Apply a MR
    penalty of 1 mark to that question. Award the marks as usual and then write –1(MR) next to the total.
    Subtract 1 mark from the total for the question. A candidate should be penalized only once for a
    particular mis-read.

    ✁ If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer
      marks.
    ✁ If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. sin ✄ 1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the
      final answer(s).

7   Discretionary marks (d)

    An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not
    cover the work seen. The mark should be labelled (d) and a brief note written next to the mark
    explaining this decision.

8   Alternative methods

    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
    specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt,
    contact your team leader for advice.

    ✁ Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
    ✁ Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
    ✁ Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
      alternatives start and finish.
                                                            –4–          SPEC/5/FURMA/HP2/ENG/TZX/XX/M

9    Alternative forms

     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

     ✁   As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
     ✁   In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
         brackets immediately following the answer.
     ✁   In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates may not write in examinations), will
         generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the bracket or
         the form in brackets (if it is seen).
     Example: for differentiating f ( x) ✂ 2sin (5 x ☎ 3) , the markscheme gives:

                f ✞ ( x) ✂ ✆ 2 cos (5 x ☎ 3) ✝ 5   ✂ 10cos (5 x ☎ 3) ✄                      A1

     Award A1 for ✟ 2cos (5 x ☎ 3) ✠ 5 , even if 10cos (5 x ☎ 3) is not seen.


10   Accuracy of Answers

     The method of dealing with accuracy errors on a whole paper basis by means of the Accuracy Penalty
     (AP) no longer applies.

     Instructions to examiners about such numerical issues will be provided on a question by question
     basis within the framework of mathematical correctness, numerical understanding and contextual
     appropriateness.

     The rubric on the front page of each question paper is given for the guidance of candidates.
     The markscheme (MS) may contain instructions to examiners in the form of “Accept answers which
     round to n significant figures (sf)”. Where candidates state answers, required by the question, to
     fewer than n sf, award A0. Some intermediate numerical answers may be required by the MS but not
     by the question. In these cases only award the mark(s) if the candidate states the answer exactly or to
     at least 2sf.

11   Crossed out work

     If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
     crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

12   Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 3, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (e.g. TI-89) are
     not allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics HL guide says:
        Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of
     calculator notation in the working.

13   More than one solution

     Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the same question, an examiner should only
     mark the first response unless the candidate indicates otherwise.

           I – an extra edge is added joining two distinct existing vertices                        R1
           II – an extra edge is added joining an existing vertex to itself,
           forming a loop                                                                           R1
           in each case v remains the same and f and e each increase by 1
           both sides of the equation increase by 1 and the equation still holds                    R1
           III – an extra vertex is added together with an edge joining this new vertex
           to an existing vertex (which is necessary to keep the graph connected)                   R1
           in this case, f remains the same and v and e each increase by 1
           both sides of the equation increase by 1 and the equation still holds                    R1
           any graph can be constructed from the basic graph by combining these
           operations, all of which result in Euler’s relation remaining valid                      R1
                                                                                                           [8 marks]


     (b)   (i)       since the graph is simple there are no loops and no multiple edges
                     and thus no circuits of length 1 or 2                                          R1
                     as we are told that there are no circuits of length 3, any face
                     must be surrounded by at least 4 edges                                         R1
                     since every edge is adjacent to 2 faces,                                       R1

      (c)   (i)    attempt to find disjoint sets of vertices                             (M1)
                   disjoint sets are {A , D, G , H} and {B, C, E , F}                      A1

            (ii)   let P✂ denote the complement of P
                   in P✂ , A is connected to D, E , F, G and H : B and C are connected to E
                   therefore A is connected to all other vertices so P✂ is connected     M1A1
                   a complete graph with 8 vertices has 28 edges                            A1
                   since P has 9 edges, P✂ has 19 edges                                     A1
