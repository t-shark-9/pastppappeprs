Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is wrong, some marks may be
given for correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Working may be continued
below the box, if necessary. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported
by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

      (i)   Celia has $ 20 000 to invest. There are two different options that she can
            choose.

            Option 1: The investment grows at a rate of 3.5 % compound interest
                      each year.
            Option 2: The total value of the investment increases by $ 800 each
                      year.

            The money is to be invested for 15 years.

            (a)   Copy and complete the table below giving the values of the
                  investments to the nearest dollar for the first 4 years.                   [3 marks]

              Option 2      20 000       20 800

            (b)   Calculate the values of each investment at the end of 15 years.            [4 marks]

            (c)   If Option 1 is chosen find the total number of complete years
                  before the values of the investment is first greater than $ 25 000.        [2 marks]

            (d)   If Option 2 is chosen calculate the percentage increase in the
                  investment for the final year.                                             [2 marks]

      (ii)   Two more Options are available to Celia. After 7 years she can change
             the investment conditions.
             Option 3: If Celia has chosen Option 1 she can change and then
                       receives $800 each year until the end of the 15 years.
             Option 4: If Celia has chosen Option 2 she can change and then receive
                       3.5 % interest compounded annually.

             If Celia wishes to receive the maximum amount of money at the end of
             the 15 years which option should she choose?                             [7 marks]
