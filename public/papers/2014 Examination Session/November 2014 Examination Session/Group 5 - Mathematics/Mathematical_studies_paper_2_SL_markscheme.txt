Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page. You are
advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given
for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic display
calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example if graphs are used to find a solution,
you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      A biologist is studying the relationship between the number of chirps of the Snowy Tree cricket
      and the air temperature. He records the chirp rate, x , of a cricket, and the corresponding air
      temperature, T , in degrees Celsius.

      The following table gives the recorded values.

                   Cricket’s chirp rate, x ,   20      40      60      80     100     120
                   (chirps per minute)
                   Temperature, T ( °C )       8.0    12.8    15.0    18.2    20.0    21.1

      (a)   Draw the scatter diagram for the above data. Use a scale of 2 cm for 20 chirps on the
             horizontal axis and 2 cm for 4 °C on the vertical axis.[4]

      (b)   Use your graphic display calculator to write down the Pearson’s product–moment
            correlation coefficient, r , between x and T .[2]

      (c)   Interpret the relationship between x and T using your value of r .[2]

      (d)   Use your graphic display calculator to write down the equation of the regression line T
             on x . Give the equation in the form T= ax + b .[2]

      (e)   Calculate the air temperature when the cricket’s chirp rate is 70.[2]

      (f)   Given that x = 70 , draw the regression line T on x on your scatter diagram.[2]

      A forest ranger uses her own formula for estimating the air temperature. She counts the number
      of chirps in 15 seconds, z , multiplies this number by 0.45 and then she adds 10.

      (g)   Write down the formula that the forest ranger uses for estimating the temperature, T .
                                          T mz + n .
            Give the equation in the form =                                                              [1]

      A cricket makes 20 chirps in 15 seconds.

      (h)   For this chirp rate

            (i)     calculate an estimate for the temperature, T , using the forest ranger’s formula;

            (ii)    determine the actual temperature recorded by the biologist, using the table above;

            (iii) calculate the percentage error in the forest ranger’s estimate for the temperature,
                  compared to the actual temperature recorded by the biologist.[6]

      Mike, the laboratory mouse, is placed at the starting point, S, of a maze. Some paths in the
      maze lead to Trap A, some to Trap B, and others to escape doors. Some paths have one and
      some have two sections. If his path forks, Mike randomly chooses a path forward.

      The following tree diagram represents the maze, showing all possible paths, and the probability
      that Mike chooses a certain section of a path through the maze.

      Tepees were traditionally used by nomadic tribes who lived on the Great Plains of
      North America. They are cone-shaped dwellings and can be modelled as a cone, with vertex O,
      shown below. The cone has radius, r , height, h , and slant height, l .

      A surveyor has to calculate the area of a triangular piece of land, DCE.
      The lengths of CE and DE cannot be directly measured because they go through a swamp.

      AB, DE, BD and AE are straight paths. Paths AE and DB intersect at point C.
      The length of AB is 15 km, BC is 10 km, AC is 12 km, and DC is 9 km.

      before the first pumpkin.

      Each player collects a single pumpkin by picking it up and bringing it back to the start. The
      nearest pumpkin is collected first. The player then collects the next nearest pumpkin and the
      game continues in this way until the signal is given for the end.
