Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

      Eric plays a game at a fairground in which he throws darts at a target. Each time he throws
      a dart, the probability of hitting the target is 0.2. He is allowed to throw as many darts as
      he likes, but it costs him $1 a throw. If he hits the target a total of three times he wins $10.

      (a)   Find the probability he has his third success of hitting the target on his sixth throw.        [3]

      (b)   (i)    Find the expected number of throws required for Eric to hit the target three times.

            (ii)   Write down his expected profit or loss if he plays until he wins the $10.               [3]

      (c)   If he has just $8, find the probability he will lose all his money before he hits the target
            three times.                                                                                   [3]

      (a)   If X and Y are two random variables such that E ( X ) = µ X and E (Y ) = µY then
            Cov ( X , Y ) = E ( ( X − µ X )(Y − µY ) ) .

            Prove that if X and Y are independent then Cov ( X , Y ) = 0 .                                  [3]

      (b)   In a particular company, it is claimed that the distance travelled by employees to work is
            independent of their salary. To test this, 20 randomly selected employees are asked about
            the distance they travel to work and the size of their salaries. It is found that the product
            moment correlation coefficient,  r , for the sample is −0.35 .

            You may assume that both salary and distance travelled to work follow normal distributions.

            Perform a one-tailed test at the 5 % significance level to test whether or not the distance
            travelled to work and the salaries of the employees are independent.                            [8]

		          (ii)   Show that T  is a more efficient unbiased estimator of λ than S .                      [3]

      (d)   Could either S or T model a Poisson distribution? Justify your answer.                        [1]

      (e)   By consideration of the probability generating function, GX +Y (t ) , of X + Y , prove that
            X + Y follows a Poisson distribution with mean 2 λ .                                          [3]

      Two species of plant, A and B, are identical in appearance though it is known that the mean
      length of leaves from a plant of species A is 5.2 cm, whereas the mean length of leaves from
      a plant of species B is 4.6 cm. Both lengths can be modelled by normal distributions with
      standard deviation 1.2 cm.

      In order to test whether a particular plant is from species A or species B, 16 leaves are
      collected at random from the plant. The length, x , of each leaf is measured and the mean
      length evaluated. A one-tailed test of the sample mean, X , is then performed at the 5 % level,
      with the hypotheses: H 0 : µ = 5.2 and H1 : µ < 5.2 .

      (a)   Find the critical region for this test.                                                          [3]

      (b)   Find the probability of a Type II error if the leaves are in fact from a plant of species B.     [2]

      It is now known that in the area in which the plant was found 90 % of all the plants are of
      species A and 10 % are of species B.

      (c)   Find the probability that X will fall within the critical region of the test.                    [2]

      (d)   If, having done the test, the sample mean is found to lie within the critical region, find the
            probability that the leaves came from a plant of species A.                                      [3]
