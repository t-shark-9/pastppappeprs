      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      The world supply curve with the tariff should be labelled Sw+T or Sworld+ tariff.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • a definition of trade protection
      • Arguments for trade protection
        - it will make things “fairer” between local and imported markets
           (paragraph )
        - it will protect employment in the local industry (paragraph )
        - it will protect employment in other, connected industries
        - increased tariff revenue for the government
        - local producers cannot compete (paragraph )
        - there are hints of dumping taking place since the producers in the US, the
           EU and Brazil are heavily subsidized (paragraph )
        - the government cannot afford subsidies therefore a tariff is justified
           (paragraph )
        - Trinidad and Tobago has the lowest tariff in the region (paragraph ) so a
           higher tariff may be justified
        - the industry is important to the economy for both jobs and revenue
           (paragraph )
        - agriculture is important for self-sufficiency

• Arguments against trade protection
  - it may raise the price to consumers, despite reassurances (paragraph )
  - it may raise the price to producers who buy the imported chicken as an input
    for their final product
  - competition may diminish and local producers may become inefficient
  - it may lead to retaliation from other countries
  - it may reduce consumption of chicken
  - equity issue, since spending on food is likely to represent a substantial
    proportion of income of low income households
  - welfare loss
  - misallocation of world’s scarce resources.

Any reasonable discussion.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths

      Responses may include:
      • definitions of aid, economic development
      • explanation of different types of aid.

      Possible positive outcomes:
      • “the high costs of importing” ARV drugs overcome by domestic production of
        drugs (paragraph )
      • “African countries aim to provide free ARV drugs to their citizens” long term
        potential for Mozambique to export to neighbouring states (paragraph )
      • “cut in funding from international foundations” possibly long term as HIV
        loses international prominence, so Brazil’s assistance with domestic production
        can provide a sustainable source of cheap ARV drugs (paragraph )
      • positive externalities of consumption (paragraph )
      • “15 % of people aged 15 to 49 have HIV” so Brazil’s exporting of their model
        of producing and providing free ARV drugs might increase life expectancy and
        productivity of workers with HIV (paragraph )
      • “Mozambique is the biggest beneficiary of aid from Brazil” (paragraph )
        and can result in increased output in long-run and improved standard of living
        (demonstrated by increase in HDI from 0.245 in 2000 to 0.322 in 2011)
      • “Brazil will provide training for Mozambican staff” which will increase quality
        of labour and improve productive capacity and export potential (paragraph )
      • “in partnership with Brazil” implies ongoing productive relationship with an
        emerging global economic power (paragraph ).

Possible negative outcomes:
• dependence on aid donor
• potential exploitation of Mozambique’s resources by Brazil who has invested
  heavily in its infrastructure and mining (paragraph )
• negative externalities arising from mining and agriculture
• potential brain drain in the long run as workers trained “in the production,

           net exports (X–M) and so a decrease in AD resulting in reduced inflationary
           pressure.

       2   There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                      3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift of the AD
           curve to the left and for explaining that the rising value of the kyat makes
           exports more expensive and/or imports cheaper resulting in a reduction in
           net exports (X–M) and so a decrease in AD resulting in reduced inflationary
           pressure.

      Candidates may take an alternative approach shifting SRAS to the right and
      explaining that the higher value of the kyat makes imported inputs less expensive,
      reducing inflationary pressure. If correctly illustrated and explained, this should
      be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks]. For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level,
      general price level or inflation. The horizontal axis may be output, real output,
      national output, real national output, national income (Y), or GDP.
      Any appropriate abbreviations such as APL, CPI, GPL, RNO, or RNY are
      allowable. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the possible effects of Burma’s market-oriented reforms on
      economic growth and development.                                      [8 marks]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

           There is clear knowledge/understanding.
           There is some attempt at application/analysis.

       3   Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.             6–8
           There is clear knowledge/understanding.
           There is effective application/analysis.
           There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and evidence.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations.

      Responses may include:
      • definitions of economic growth and economic development
      • explanation that reforms are market-oriented supply-side policies and may
        improve the institutional framework of Burma.

      Reforms may include:
      • “deregulation, breaking up local monopolies, the development of property
        rights and improvements of the legal system” (paragraph )
      • “reduced export costs and made it easier for citizens living abroad to transfer
        money back to Burma” (paragraph ), increasing remittances and improving
        the current account balance
      • “Some private banks are, for the first time, being allowed to trade in foreign
        currencies, providing an additional source of foreign investment”
        (paragraph )
      • “the government recently reduced subsidies on fuel” (paragraph ).

Links to economic growth and economic development may include:
• explanations as to how the above mentioned reforms might work
• explanations of the challenges of implementing the above mentioned reforms
• “Burma is now open for business” (paragraph ) so trade and investment are
   likely to increase, thus increasing AD, and/or LRAS, and possibly breaking the
   poverty trap
• “Unfortunately, efforts to boost economic development have been slower.”
   (paragraph )
• “one third of its 60 million citizens live in poverty.” (paragraph )
• “resource-rich nation significant opportunities in terms of investment and
   trade” (paragraph )
• “Economists warn inflation could threaten reform efforts” (paragraph )
   undermining both growth and development.

Any other reasonable evaluation.
