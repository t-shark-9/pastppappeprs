3.     The map shows the distribution of coastal “dead zones” in North America and the Caribbean.
       A dead zone is an area with significantly reduced marine life (due to pollution).

		(i)                one coastal landform resulting mainly from erosion;                                  [3]

		(ii)               one coastal landform resulting mainly from deposition.                               [3]

       (c)   “Management strategies for coastlines are generally ineffective.” Discuss this
             statement with reference to one named coastline you have studied.                           [10]




                                                                    (Option B continues on the following page)

		(ii)            Outline how a conflict might arise from competition over exclusive
                  economic zones (EEZs).                                                        [3]

      (b)   Explain the role of oceans:

		(i)             as a store of carbon dioxide;                                                 [3]

		(ii)            as a source of carbon dioxide.                                                [3]

      (c)   “To provide sustainable fish yields we must stop overfishing the oceans and
            promote aquaculture instead.” Discuss this statement.                              [10]

        The climate graph is of Arkhangelsk (64N, 60E), a periglacial area in northern Russia.

      (a)   From information shown on the graph:

		(i)             State the number of months of the year when the average temperature is
                  below 0°C.                                                                           [1]

		(iii) Apart from temperature, outline one other climatic characteristic shown on
        the graph that indicates Arkhangelsk is located in an extreme environment.                     [2]

      (b)   Explain three ways in which people have adapted to the extremes of weather
            and climate in periglacial areas such as Arkhangelsk.                                  [2+2+2]

      (c)   “Desertification is the main environmental risk for agriculture in hot deserts and
            semi-arid areas.” Discuss this statement, with reference to examples.                     [10]
