Prescribed subject 2         The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These questions relate to the reign of Roger II of Sicily, 1130–1154.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source B, were the virtues of Roger II as king of Sicily?     [3 marks]

                Roger II worked hard to administer justice;
                Roger II understood that severity was necessary to guarantee the stability of his
                 kingdom;
                Roger II was fair to those who deserved his favour but punished those who took
                 advantage of him;
                Roger II was a prudent and careful man.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                        [2 marks]

                Roger II had been made king by Christ;
                Roger II saw his authority as coming directly from Christ;
                Roger II’s wearing of imperial robes shows that he saw himself as having imperial
                 powers.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                                –4–                N14/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about Roger II’s
     rule as king of Sicily.                                                      [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources mention that Roger II faced serious opposition to his rule;
      Both sources mention that Apulia was the centre for opposition;
      Both sources mention that Roger imposed harsh punishments on his enemies.


     For “contrast”
      Source C mentions financial exploitation by Roger whereas Source D does not;
      Source C tells us that Roger was a cruel king whereas Source D infers that whilst his
       contemporaries viewed him as a cruel king, he was more likely to be a methodical and
       calculating king;
      Source D claims that Roger was very harsh because he felt that he only had limited time in
       which to impose his authority on the kingdom;
      Source D, while presenting the facts of Roger II’s cruelty, attempts to find some degree of
       justification and to show a softer side of his character, such as sadness at his family losses.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks].
     If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks].
     For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast. Award up to [5 marks] if
     two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of
     Source A and Source B for historians studying the reign of Roger II.             [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        Created by Romuald Guarna, Archbishop of Salerno and physician to King William
                    I, in Sicily in the late 12th century.

     Purpose:       To give a narrative account of events in the kingdom of Sicily from the perspective
                    of a well-connected figure at the royal court.

     Value:         Romuald was a knowledgeable figure close to the royal government, with access to
                    individuals who may have known Roger II personally.

     Limitations:   As Romuald worked for William I, he may have had an incentive to criticize the
                    previous king, Roger II, to make his master look better.

     Source B
     Origin:        Written in the late 12th century in Sicily (probably by a royal official using a
                    pseudonym).

     Purpose:       To give a narrative account of the reigns of the kings of Sicily from the perspective
                    of someone who is believed to have had personal knowledge of the royal court.

     Value:         The source was produced in Sicily by an individual who may have had direct
                    knowledge of the royal court.

     Limitations:   The authorship of the account is uncertain; the name Hugo Falcandus is believed to
                    be invented. The praise for Roger II may have been intended to gain the favour of
                    the Sicilian royal family by offering justification for the king’s actions.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, evaluate the claim that Roger II ruled
     through violence and brutality.                                                  [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A: This source shows that Roger II could be spiteful and bitter towards his enemies, even
                after they had died.

     Source B:    This source defends the reputation of Roger II, justifying his use of harsh retribution
                  against his enemies as being necessary to maintain his rule.

     Source C:    This source argues that Roger II was excessively brutal and violent in his behaviour,
                  more so even than the standards of the time. However, it also argues that his actions
                  were inevitable for political reasons.

     Source D:    This source argues that, although Roger II did use violent retribution, this was made
                  necessary by the revolts and long insurrections that he faced. Also, that Roger II did
                  have human feelings, shown by his mourning for the deaths of his wife, Elvira, and
                  their sons.

     Source E:    This source presents Roger II as a divinely-approved monarch, who owed his title and
                  authority to Christ’s blessing, and therefore ruled by divine approval. It also sends a
                  message that no other “earthly” authority is above him.

     Own knowledge
     Roger II did use high levels of violence to assert his authority as the first Norman king of Sicily,
     and in retaliation against enemies and rebels.

     For example, when asserting his authority over rival princes and noblemen in 1133, he had the town
     of Troia partially burned, some of its leading inhabitants hanged, and women and children
     imprisoned in chains. Roger II’s position became extremely vulnerable in 1135–1137, due to a
     German imperial invasion in support of his baronial enemies. In 1137 he destroyed the city of
     Capua, which had supported his great enemy, Rainulf of Alife. Jaquintus, Prince of Bari, who had
     rebelled against Roger II and mutilated some of the king’s men when captives, was blinded along
     with his leading advisors.

     However, Roger II did not rule by force alone. His power was mostly exercised through the law,
     such as the Assizes (a collection of laws) that he issued at Ariano around 1140. According to
     contemporaries, Roger II had a strong interest in the law and governance.

     Roger II also ruled through several institutions, which were staffed with servants from many
     countries, and speaking many languages including Greek, Latin, Arabic and French. Roger II’s
     most senior official was the Grand Emir, George of Antioch, and he also had a chancellor and
     several royal chamberlains. Two of his chancellors were English, Thomas Brown and Robert
     Selby, who were likely to have been well educated in England or Normandy.

     There were several administrative offices called diwans, which were responsible for auditing
     accounts, managing the king’s lands, and hearing pleas to the king.

     Roger II also built and rebuilt several castles to assert his rule, including those at Troia, Melfi and
     Bari.

A further feature of how Roger II ruled was through the projection of the royal image. In addition
to the mosaics at the Martorana, Roger II also conveyed his regal image through seals and coins that
asserted his royal authority, and which claimed Christ’s blessing for his rule.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum [8 marks]
expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the
sources used.
