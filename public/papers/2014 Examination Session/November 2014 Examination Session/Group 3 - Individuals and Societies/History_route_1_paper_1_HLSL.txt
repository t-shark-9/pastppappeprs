These sources and questions relate to the reign of Roger II of Sicily, 1130–1154.

SOURCE A                 Romuald Guarna, Archbishop of Salerno and physician to King William I (the son
                         and only successor of Roger II), in The Chronicle of Romuald of Salerno written
                         in the Kingdom of Sicily in the late 12th century.

                         Note: Duke Rainulf of Alife had rebelled against Roger II’s rule.

Duke Rainulf’s enemies ordered one of the knights, a man called Gallicanus, who had been one of his
most faithful followers, to break open Rainulf’s tomb and remove with his own hands the putrifying body.
They did this both to injure the dead duke and to cause Gallicanus pain. Gallicanus was forced by the fear
of incurring the king’s wrath to carry the duke’s poor bones. Oh horror! The duke’s enemies immediately
fastened a rope around the corpse’s neck and dragged it through the streets up to the town’s citadel.
They then turned around and went to the charcoal workings outside the town where there was a filthy
stagnant ditch, into which they sank the duke’s body. What an evil action! Fear and horror straightaway
invaded the whole town and affected everyone, both friends and enemies of the duke. … How could such
cruelty as this profit the king’s authority? What victory or royal authority did it lead to? But wishing to
satisfy his rage against one on whom he could not exercise it while he was alive, he did it when he was dead.


SOURCE B                 Hugo Falcandus (probably the pseudonym [false name] of a royal official in Sicily)
                         in the eyewitness account The History of the Tyrants of Sicily (late 12th century).

In short, he [Roger] made efforts to administer justice in its full rigour on the grounds that it was particularly
necessary for a newly established realm, and to exercise the options of peace and war by turns, with the
result that he omitted nothing that virtue requires, and had no king or prince as his equal during his lifetime.
Some writers categorize many of his actions as tyrannical and call him inhuman because he imposed on
many men penalties that were severe and not prescribed by the laws, but it is my opinion that as a prudent
[wise] man who was circumspect [careful] in all things, he intentionally behaved in this way when his
monarchy was only recently established so that wicked men should not go unpunished for their crimes;
and that while those men who were loyal should not be turned against him by too much harshness,
there should nevertheless be no place for contempt as a result of excessive mildness. And if, perhaps, he
seems to have acted somewhat harshly against some, I suppose that he was forced to do it by some necessity.
For there was no other way in which the savagery of a rebellious people could have been suppressed, or the
daring of traitors restrained.

SOURCE C                Helene Wieruszowski, a professor of History writing in the article “Roger II of
                        Sicily, Rex-Tyrannus [Tyrant-King], in Twelfth Century Political Thought” for the
                        academic journal Speculum (1963).

Political anarchy … forced upon Roger means of repression that were as inevitable from the political as
they were inexcusable from the moral point of view. After 1138 Roger began in Apulia a reign of terror
calculated to uproot rebellion and treason by sheer fear of the consequences. Brutality and cruelty paired
with a ruthless financial exploitation characterized this regime, which was made all the more intolerable
because it was frequently enforced by Roger’s Muslim mercenaries, who were not to be expected to show
mercy to Christians.

To be sure, this was still an age of barbarism and Roger’s contemporaries were used to cruel acts of revenge.
But the points that really horrified observers and singled out the Sicilian king from other tyrants, great and
petty, was the cold-blooded, systematic and efficient way these deeds were inflicted on the victims and the
fact that their author never showed any sign of repentance or readiness to atone for his deeds.


SOURCE D                Edmund Curtis, a professor of History writing in the academic book Roger of Sicily
                        and the Normans in Lower Italy, 1016–1154 (1912).

The cruelty displayed by Roger in his campaigns was, if we take the evidence of his contemporaries,
far beyond the practices of his age. Yet, there was method and finality to Roger’s severities … He was
hard-pressed by frequent coalitions [against him]; the rebellious attitude of the Apulian and Campanian
towns and baronage was unstoppable; more than once his kingdom was at stake. Besides, he had the
mind of a legislator and an organizer … he felt that his time was all too brief, and justified any measure
that cleared the way to the serious work of his reign. Here and there the chroniclers and the records give
us some insights upon Roger’s more intimate character. We can see how deeply and for how long he was
affected by the death of his wife, Elvira; in the same way he was saddened by the loss of his three sons
in succession, who had been loyal lieutenants to him.
