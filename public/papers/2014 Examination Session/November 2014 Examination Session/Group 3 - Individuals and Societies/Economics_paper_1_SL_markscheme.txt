Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain how the price mechanism allocates resources in an economy.                  [10 marks]

           Answers may include:
            definition of the price mechanism
            diagram(s) (demand and supply) to show how price changes lead to a
             reallocation of resources
            an explanation of how the signalling function of price allocates resources when
             price changes in terms of telling producers about changing market conditions;
             the incentive function of price allocates resources when price changes in terms
             of providing an incentive for consumers and producers to make decisions
            example(s) to show the signalling and incentive functions of price.

(b)   Evaluate the view that attempts to achieve greater equity in the distribution
      of income will reduce economic efficiency.                                    [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
       definitions of equity and economic efficiency
       diagrams to show use of different policies, eg to show progressive taxes;
        diagram to show a production possibility frontier
       an explanation of the role of taxation in promoting equity in the distribution of
        income; government expenditure on public services, subsidies and transfer
        payments. Explanation of the impact of the policies on economic efficiency
       example(s) of where such policies have been used
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: a consideration of the positive and negative
      consequences of the different policies used, the impact of the policies on different
      stakeholders and their effect on efficiency.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.
