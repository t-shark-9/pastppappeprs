Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Using diagram(s), explain the signalling and incentive functions of price.    [10 marks]

           Answers may include:
            definition of price mechanism
            diagram(s) (supply and demand) to illustrate the signalling and incentive
             functions of price
            an explanation of the price mechanism to show how changes in supply
             and demand ration scarce resources through the signalling and incentive
             functions of price
            examples of price providing a signalling and incentive function.

(b)   Evaluate the view that the market failure caused by the consumption of
      demerit goods is best dealt with through the use of taxation.          [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
       definitions of demerit goods, market failure and indirect taxation
       diagram(s) to show market failure and use of indirect taxation
       explanations of the market failure caused by the consumption of demerit goods
        (negative consumption externalities); taxation policy to reduce consumption of
        demerit goods; other market based policies, ie tradable permits and non
        market-based policies, eg regulation and negative advertising
       examples of demerit goods and examples of where such responses have
        occurred, or might occur
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: consideration of the positive and negative consequences
      of the policies used.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.

(b)   Evaluate the view that attempts to achieve greater equity in the distribution
      of income will reduce economic efficiency.                                    [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
       definitions of equity and economic efficiency
       diagrams to show use of different policies, eg to show progressive taxes;
        diagram to show a production possibility frontier
       an explanation of the role of taxation in promoting equity in the distribution of
        income; government expenditure on public services, subsidies and transfer
        payments. Explanation of the impact of the policies on economic efficiency
       examples of where such policies have been used
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: a consideration of the positive and negative
      consequences of the different policies used, the impact of the policies on different
      stakeholders and their effect on efficiency.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported by
      appropriate examples.
