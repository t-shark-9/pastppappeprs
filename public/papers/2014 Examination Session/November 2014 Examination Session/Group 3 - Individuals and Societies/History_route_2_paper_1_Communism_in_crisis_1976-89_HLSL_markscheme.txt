1.   (a)   What, according to Source A, are the reasons for China’s
           backwardness?                                                                  [3 marks]

            China’s “closed door” policy limited trade with industrialised Western countries and
             prevented industrialisation.
            A trade blockade was imposed after the founding of the People’s Republic of China
             (PRC) and created economic difficulties.
            Internal exclusion among the different regions of China made for limited economic
             development.
            China had a weak domestic economy.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                      [2 marks]

            The photograph reflects the spread of Western goods in China.
            The young man is openly drinking Coca–Cola in the grounds of the Imperial Palace,
             suggesting a more open environment.
            The young man says, “It tastes so-so”, suggesting that he is not that impressed.
            The young man looks well-dressed and/or he is consuming foreign goods suggesting
             improved living standards.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                               –4–                  N14/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S3/M



2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and C about the
     social and economic impact of the Special Economic Zones.                           [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources give the impression that there were significant social and economic changes.
      Both sources view Hong Kong’s proximity to the SEZs as important.
      Both suggest that Chinese workers worked for low wages and/or labour was exploited.

     For “contrast”
      Source B’s view is that the impact was wholly negative whereas Source C suggests there
       were some positive outcomes.
      Source B and C differ on the reasons for the low wages. Source B blames the exploitation
       of Chinese workers on foreign capital whereas Source C suggests that there was
       oversupply of labour resulting in even lower wages.
      Source B suggests that foreigners benefitted whereas Source C suggests there were benefits
       for the Chinese in terms of learning new skills.
      Source B suggests that an economic result of the policies was corruption whereas Source C
       highlights increased economic activity and/or diversity and/or opportunity.
      Source B focuses on the impact on workers in the SEZs whereas Source C also considers
       the impact outside these areas.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
     Award up to [5 marks] if two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison
     or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source D for historians studying the reasons for, and the
     impact of, Deng Xiaoping’s (Teng Hsiao-p’ing’s) economic policies.                     [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        This is from a speech given by Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing) in 1984 to a
                    Japanese delegation.

     Purpose:       Its purpose is to explain why China has been slow to develop in the past and
                    the reasons for its present economic policies. It aims to encourage foreign
                    investment and allay fears of Japanese investors.

     Value:         This is the viewpoint of Deng Xiaoping who was, at that time, the paramount
                    leader of China and who determined policy. His views would be those of the
                    Chinese government. It would offer an insight into how the PRC wanted to
                    portray itself to other nations in the region.

     Limitations:   Deng may be exaggerating the negative impact of previous Chinese policies in
                    order to justify the direction in which he is going. He may also be exaggerating
                    the determination with which China was ready to open up to trade so that the
                    Japanese would be encouraged to invest. It also lacks hindsight as the process
                    of reform was ongoing in 1984.

     Source D
     Origin:        This is from a newspaper article recounting and commenting on a speech made
                    by Chen Yun, a senior Communist Party official. It was published in
                    “The Christian Science Monitor” in 1985.

     Purpose:       The purpose is to inform US readers about the speech that questions the nature
                    of Deng’s reform programme and identifies possible problems.

     Value:         It was published outside China and was therefore less likely to be censored. It
                    offers an insight into how the reforms were reported in the west in the 1980s.
                    It was written during the implementation of Deng’s reforms and quotes from a
                    speech by a leading Communist Party member, Chen Yun, and therefore could
                    provide insight into how the reforms were viewed in China by a high-ranking
                    official.

     Limitations:   As this is a report by a US journalist, it could be suggested that his personal
                    opinions may have led him to select which parts of the speech to recount.
                    Some candidates may also suggest that The Christian Science Monitor may be
                    intended to present the news from a Christian perspective (although some may
                    know that it is a widely-read newspaper with a focus on international news). It
                    is a western interpretation of events and it lacks hindsight. In addition, the
                    extent to which Chen Yun’s views were taken into account in the PRC cannot
                    be known. Chen may have overemphasized the problems to strengthen his
                    political position.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally, there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, discuss the successes and
     failures of Deng Xiaoping’s (Teng Hsiao-p’ing’s) economic policies up
     to 1986.                                                                            [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source outlines the reasons for the backwardness of the Chinese economy as
                  perceived and explained by Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing). It suggests that
                  China had a long way to go to make up for this and that both investment and
                  reform were needed.

     Source B:     This source is very critical of the exploitation of Chinese workers in the SEZs.
                   It is also critical of members of the Party hierarchy that were involved in
                   corrupt practices. It does not see the SEZs as beneficial for the development of
                   the Chinese economy. It suggests that foreigners benefitted from the reforms.

     Source C:     This source may be viewed as critical of low wages but also stresses
                   economic growth and the links with neighbouring Hong Kong that allow for
                   people from mainland China to learn management skills from their wealthy
                   neighbour. Details are given as to the kind of goods that are produced and so
                   suggest that the economy is diversifying. It is stated that Hong Kong’s
                   economy was increasingly dominated by mainland investment and this may
                   also be mentioned as a success.

     Source D:     This source outlines Chen Yun’s criticism of Deng’s policies. Chen refers to
                   the grain shortages that are a result of farmers turning to more profitable crops
                   and rural industries and warns grain shortages could risk social disorder. Chen
                   suggests that the focus has been on industry rather than agriculture. Chen
                   suggests reforms are moving too far towards a market-orientated economy.

     Source E:     The photo indicates that China is opening up to imported goods. It could also
                   be inferred that people could purchase these goods and so were sharing in
                   economic growth. The man’s indifference to the drink could suggest that
                   standards in China are rising or that some people did not see the influx of
                   Western goods as an improvement.

     Own knowledge
     References to “successes” could include: the popularity of Deng’s ideology (Four
     Modernizations) and his aim of opening China up to foreign investment and development; the
     success of the “household responsibility system” in agriculture and the opportunities this
     offered for increased production; the flourishing of the “township and village enterprises”
     (TVEs); mention may also be made of the impressive growth levels of the Chinese economy
     and how these were higher than forecast; increase in output of coal and steel; the rise in
     exports; the rapid development of urban centres could also be mentioned as workers were
     drawn to the cities. The decrease in child mortality may be mentioned.

     For “failures”, candidates could mention the following: the end of the “iron rice bowl”
     whereby workers in the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) found their benefits to be curtailed;
     the growth of unemployment; inflation; increase in food prices; the creation of ‘two
     economies’ between the wealthy SEZs and the poverty in other areas; the growing demand for
     political reform that was prompted, in part, by economic reforms; resistance to change by
     some members of the Politburo; widespread corruption.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
[8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
references to the sources used.
