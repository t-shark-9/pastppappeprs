Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Pre-colonial African states (Eastern and Central Africa) 1840–1900

1.   “Trade was the most significant factor in the rise of both Mirambo of Unyamwezi and
     Mkwawa of the Hehe as leaders.” Discuss.

     Candidates should discuss the role played by trade in the emergence of the Mirambo and
     Mkwawa as strong leaders. Material in this discussion could include: the importance of the two
     leaders in controlling important trade routes and imposing taxes that they then used to develop their
     kingdoms and strengthen their position as leaders; the role played by trade in ivory and slaves; the
     importance of their military strategies, which were borrowed from the Ngoni; the importance of
     guns, which were often traded, in their military strategy.

     Factors other than trade should also be discussed. These could include: the strength of their
     armies, which enabled them to conquer neighbouring territories; the role played by the relationship
     between Mirambo and the missionaries in his development as a strong leader; Mkwawa’s method of
     appointing and dismissing officials, which enabled him to establish a centralized political system
     and his use of marriage alliances; raids carried out on trading caravans that ran from the lakes
     region to the coast.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
     fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

2.   “Without common grievances, the Mahdist movement against Anglo–Egyptian rule would
     have been a failure.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This question expects candidates to discuss the role played by common grievances in the success of
     the Mahdist movement against Egyptian rule, along with an analysis of other factors that
     contributed to the success of the movement.

     Some of the common grievances that candidates should consider include: the imposition of high
     taxes on livestock by the government; attempts to abolish slavery; the Egyptians bringing in their
     own Islamic teachers thus ignoring the Sheikhs and their established brotherhood; forced
     conscription of Sudanese into the Egyptian army; suppression of indigenous cultural practices in the
     region; attempts by the British to monopolise trade, which harmed the interests of the merchant
     classes in Khartoum; the appointment of a Christian as their Governor General and the appointment
     of General Gordon as governor.

     Other factors that contributed to the success of the Mahdist movement include: the appearance of
     Muhammad Ahmad ibn Abdallah – the Mahdi (guided one), who led the jihad and whose religious
     aim was the purification of Islam; the importance of the Mahdi’s relationship to Abdallahi ibn
     Muhammad (a soothsayer who was more a man of action than the visionary Mahdi) – the
     combination of the two contributed to the success of the movement as they drew together a large
     group of supporters. Candidates may also consider: Abdallahi’s military strategy; the failure of the
     British to support the Egyptian government; the limited Egyptian forces; the government’s
     bankruptcy; poor organization of the army and the low morale of its personnel; the partial
     withdrawal of Anglo–Egyptian authority after 1880 and the fact that the Mahdi had the support of
     many Muslims in the Sudan area.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
     fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Pre-colonial African states (Southern and West Africa) 1800–1900

3.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, the Sokoto jihad.

     Reasons for: Candidates should discuss the factors that contributed to the Sokoto jihad.
     These factors would include the fact that there was a need to reform Islam and that Christianity was
     expanding (and thus posing a threat to Islam). Other factors that should be considered could
     include: Usman Dan Fodio’s hatred of the oppression of the poor by rich members of the society;
     taxation by the Hausa emirs of the cattle of pastoralist communities (both Hausa and Fulani), Fulani
     grievances at Hausa domination, rivalries of the Hausa emirates, the bringing of all Sudanese
     accused of impiety and heresy to repentance; to reform the teachings of Islam that had been tainted
     through alcoholism, heavy taxation, refusal to pay Zakat etc.

     Results of: Candidates must discuss the results of the Sokoto jihad. These could include: the
     creation of new political systems where sharia law was emphasized; the spread of Islam and Islamic
     education in many areas; the unity of the Hausa people; the spread of jihad into many other areas –
     many leaders like those in Zaria and Katsina were forced to flee (before setting up new states); the
     death and destruction of war in general; the appointment of the ruling family (Habe) with the Fula
     (educated Muslims) by Dan Fodio. It is important to note that despite the violence that came with
     the jihad, trade continued among the various groups in the area, eg between the farmers, the cattle
     herders and the artisans. Another result was the creation of a strong federal Fulani state that
     dominated for much of the 19th century and eventually collaborated with the British.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
     fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

4.   Compare and contrast the organization of the Mandinka Empire under Samori Toure and the
     Asante Empire under Osei Tutu.

     The question calls for candidates to compare and contrast the organization of the Mandinka Empire
     under Samori and the Asante Empire under Osei Tutu.

     Comparisons: In both empires leaders had authority over the whole empire: they emphasized the
     building of strong armies; used religion as a means of establishing unity; they both established a
     capital city; incorporated defeated neighbours into their communities; they both placed an emphasis
     on trade and agriculture; both appointed relatives to key positions; both traded in firearms.
     Their emphasis on the gold trade should also be discussed.

     Contrasts: Candidates could discuss the fact that unlike the Asante Empire, Samori’s Kingdom
     was divided into provinces: whilst there was an emphasis on Islamic faith as a means of achieving
     unity in the Mandinka Empire, in the Asante Empire the emphasis was on traditional religion with
     the “Golden Stool” acting as a symbol of unity. Samori organized his blacksmiths to develop
     weapons for his forces, while in the Asante Empire weapons were mainly obtained through trade.
     In the Asante Empire, communication and trade were enhanced by a good road network.

     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best

European imperialism and annexation of Africa 1850–1900

5.   “Political and cultural disunity across Africa enabled the European powers to annex it
     with ease.” Discuss.

     This question calls for candidates to have a clear understanding of the role played by African
     weaknesses in the annexation of Africa, with a particular focus on the political and cultural disunity
     among the African societies.

     They should then consider other weaknesses and these would include military weaknesses, and their
     inability to acquire modern weaponry. Candidates then should discuss other factors for annexation
     and these would include European methods of gaining favour from Africans through the provision
     of medical and educational facilities. Some of the Africans also got the opportunity to work in
     colonial administration if they worked closely with the Europeans. Examples of societies and
     people who worked closely with the Europeans would include Lozi, Ngoni, Tswana and the Ngwato
     etc.

     Candidates should also note that there were African societies and leaders who resisted European
     rule and these would include the Nandi, Menelik, Lobengula, Samori Toure, Ndebele, the
     Maji Maji rising, etc.

     Candidates should also examine a range of other factors, including: the strength of European forces
     and the Europeans’ use of more sophisticated weaponry; the role played by the missionaries,
     explorers and traders in easing the path for the annexation of Africa.

     The conclusion must be very clear as to the role played by political and cultural disunity of the
     Africans in the annexation of Africa in relation to other factors.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best

6.   “The British occupation of Egypt played a more significant role in the partition of Africa than
     the Berlin West Africa Conference.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This is a comparison question that expects candidates to decide which event played a more
     prominent role in the partitioning of Africa: the Egyptian occupation or the Berlin West African
     Conference.

     Candidates should have a clear understanding of the British occupation of Egypt and the role
     that this played in the partitioning of Africa. Candidates should discuss how this occupation
     contributed to the French activities in Africa that, in turn, exacerbated partition. Candidates should
     discuss the consequence of French unhappiness about British control of Egypt: that it led to them
     looking for territory to annex elsewhere in Africa. This is what eventually led to Anglo–French
     rivalry in West Africa and increased British interest in both Uganda and Sudan
     (fear that the French might control the headwaters of the Nile).

     The Berlin West Africa Conference was suggested by Bismarck and was held in Berlin from
     November 1884 to November 1885. The conference laid down rules for the European partition of
     Africa and also sought to avoid any armed conflict among the countries concerned: its aim was not
     to set up boundaries between territories, in fact, the only territory to be recognized at this time was
     King Leopold of Belgium’s Congo Free State. The conference also aimed to resolve the dispute
     between the Portuguese, the Belgians and the French over their territorial claims along the
     Congo River. Other issues discussed at the conference included the issue of the slave trade in the
     interior of Africa.

     At the conference, various resolutions were passed and these included the decision that any country
     taking up territory in Africa had to deal with the issue of the slave trade in that territory; it was
     agreed that any European state taking possession of any territory in Africa had to notify other
     signatories of the Berlin Act who then had a right to discuss any claim; it was further agreed that
     any country wishing to declare a protectorate had to effectively occupy the territory, thus causing
     the “scramble” as each country staked their claim before anyone else did. This effectively ended
     the British pursuit of informal empires. The conference also agreed that there should be freedom of
     navigation on both the Niger and the Congo Rivers.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
     fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Response to European imperialism (Eastern and Central Africa) 1880–1915

7.   Compare and contrast the responses of Kabaka Mwanga and Apolo Kagwa to European
     imperialism in Buganda.

     Contrasts will probably outweigh the comparisons.

     Comparisons: Each sought to preserve the independence of their kingdom through some measure
     of collaboration with the British. Mwanga signed a protection treaty with the British Imperial
     British East Africa Company (IBEAC) in 1890 in order to fend off their imperialist designs and
     return as kabaka. Apolo Kagwa signed the Uganda Agreement that extended Buganda autonomy
     into the colonial period.

     Contrasts: Mwanga eventually chose resistance, Apolo Kagwa collaboration. Mwanga was
     unsuccessful; he was outnumbered by the IBEAC and his rebellion of 1897 was defeated whereas
     Apolo Kagwa was successful. Kagwa double-crossed Mwanga, was appointed prime minister,
     persuaded the British to recognize an independent Buganda parliament, and exercised a
     sub-imperialism over the other peoples of colonial Uganda. Mwanga attempted to play religious
     factions against one another to keep the imperialists at bay, and he alienated the British as a result.
     Apolo Kagwa was steadfastly Protestant and used this to his advantage in negotiating with the
     British, and where Mwanga had a number of colonial threats to deal with (British, French, German,
     and Arab), Apolo Kagwa had just the British.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best

8.   Examine the course and impact of the Ndebele–Shona rising.

     This is a two part question that expects candidates to analyse both the course and impact of the
     Ndebele–Shona rising.

     Candidates may discuss a range of factors leading to the beginning of the Ndebele–Shona rising in
     March 1896, including: the loss of independence experienced by the Ndebele and Shona following
     British settlement; their resentment at being treated in the same way as communities they had once
     conquered and ruled; grievances at the loss of cattle (either to rinderpest or confiscation by officials
     from the British South Africa Company); their opposition to forced labour and the mistreatment of
     their people by Company police.

     Given the focus of the question, it is important for candidates to explain events as they unfolded
     during the Ndebele–Shona rising. In discussing the course of the rising, it is important for the
     candidates to discuss the role played by the Mwari cult in unifying the two communities that were
     otherwise divided. It is important for them to discuss Mkwati’s method of convincing people to
     attack and kill all the Europeans. Furthermore, it is important for candidates to discuss how the
     priests and spirit mediums were used to spread the word about the aims of the rising to more parts
     of Mashonaland and Matabeleland. Mention can also be made of the warriors who accompanied
     the priests for protection.

     Candidates also need to discuss the role played by the Ndebele Indunas. They may discuss the role
     played by the main leaders of the rising, Umlugulu and Nyamanda, and discuss how Umlugulu,
     with the help of the indunas, hoped to use the Great Dance held in the mining area to choose a
     successor for Lobengula. Mention could also be made of the killing of the policemen at Dawson’s
     store which led to the failure of the Great Dance.

     It is important for candidates to mention that the rising took the whites by surprise since the rising
     had been planned in secret by the priests. They could note that while the Ndebele rising was
     declining, the Shona rising was ongoing; the Shona invaded European farms and forced those
     captured into camps. Candidates could also mention the attacks on isolated farms that took place
     while the company police were busy carrying out the Jameson Raid in Transvaal. In discussing the
     impact candidates may mention the fact that many people lost their lives, many refugees were
     forced into camps in Bulawayo, Gwelo, and Mangwe etc.

     The Ndebele were defeated with the help of Khama and Lewanika; however the Shona continued
     fighting until they but were eventually defeated by the British who had better weapons. Aside from
     the death and destruction that accompanied the rising, it had an impact that was felt in a number of
     ways. These included the disruption of trade and agriculture and the changing attitude of the
     colonial administration, which eventually recognized the indunas and became more sensitive to the
     grievances of the Africans. Candidates may also note that the Ndebele–Shona rising was a great
     inspiration to future nationalists.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
     fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Response to European imperialism (Southern and West Africa) 1870–1920

9.   To what extent can Khama be considered to have been a successful ruler?

     This question requires candidates to discuss the successes and the failures of Khama, King of
     Bamangwato from 1875 to 1923.

     Successes: Khama used the British to protect his people from the Ndebele and the Boers: a factor
     that contributed to the British declaring a protectorate over Bechuanaland in 1891; he organized his
     soldiers to fight against the Ndebele, strengthening his credentials with the British as a result; he
     worked closely with the missionaries of the London Missionary Society by whom he had been
     baptized; and increased the prosperity of his kingdom through trade with Europeans. His actions
     helped to ensure that his territory did not end up under the control of the British South Africa
     Company.

     In addition to the above, his success led to the British appointing a resident Commissioner, with
     Khama becoming a chief under an indirect system of rule; he promoted developments in agriculture
     and education, which were signs that he was a modernizer; as a collaborator he was able to use the
     British against his kingdom’s enemies.

     Failures: Candidates might argue that his collaboration with the British South Africa Company in
     order to defeat the Ndebele was a failure as it may well have undermined his position. Furthermore,
     they may indicate that his support of Christianity ensured that his own popular support declined as
     many still followed traditional religious practices and beliefs (he rejected male circumcision, was
     opposed to arranged marriages and disapproved of those who profited from the sale of alcohol). He
     may also be considered an autocrat because of the way he made decisions affecting his people with
     very little consultation. Another point is that his kingdom was reduced to the status of a
     protectorate.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best

10.   To what extent did Cetshwayo’s relationship with the British lead to his overthrow?

      Candidates should discuss how the relationship between Cetshwayo and the British led to his
      deposition, but they may also discuss other factors.

      Cetshwayo took over the leadership of the Zulu kingdom in 1873 and he immediately turned around
      the policy of peaceful co-existence that had been implemented by his predecessor, Mpanda.
      His revival of Shaka Zulu’s military organization caused a lot of discomfort among the
      neighbouring white communities and the Boers in particular. Border skirmishes with the Transvaal
      led to Cetshwayo proposing an alliance with the British. British refusal led to increasing animosity
      between the two. This was only exacerbated when, in 1877, the British took control over Transvaal
      – a move that was resented by the Boers. False information, spread by mercenaries, suggested that
      Cetshwayo’s intention was to attack the white population (as a response to his refusal to allow
      missionaries into Zululand). While the British wanted to control Zululand for taxation, the Zulu
      wanted to regain their lost territory, and an attempt by the Zulu to retrieve their territory resulted in
      more land losses.

      To support their arguments, candidates may elect to discuss the war that Frere pushed Cetshwayo
      into (the battle of Isandhlwana, 1879 and its outcomes). They could also discuss the battle of
      Ulundi (which the Zulus lost). Following Cetshwayo’s defeat, he was sent into exile in Cape Town.
      On his return, his kingdom had been split into two warring factions with one group still
      supporting him. When his supporters were defeated, he was once again forced into exile where he
      died in 1884.

Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

11.   To what extent did hatred of the Bantustans escalate resistance to the apartheid system
      between 1948 and 1960?

      Candidates should have clear knowledge of the extent to which the establishment of the Bantustans
      escalated resistance to the apartheid system. They should then discuss other factors that also
      contributed to the resistance.

      Candidates may discuss the reasons for the establishment of the Bantustans and the impact they had
      on the lives of South Africans. The establishment of Bantustans or the Homelands was a result of
      the Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act (1959). Their establishment was resented by Black
      South Africans, as were the methods used to settle them in the Bantustans: ethnic groups were split
      up and settled in different areas to create disunity among them; families were moved out of their
      traditional lands. Bantustans were aimed at segregating White and Black South Africans.
      Bantustan lands were small and marginal and were established where few economic activities could
      be carried out. The promises made about industrialising the Bantustans were never fulfilled and
      many of those in the Bantustans had to work outside their residential areas. This necessitated the
      use of the much-hated passes that permitted movement in and out of the Bantustans.

      Other factors that led to the resistance against apartheid included: the segregation laws; the labour
      laws; the emphasis on Afrikaans; the detention of African leaders etc. These were already in place
      before the advent of the Bantustans and resulted in mass popular resistance in the 1950s.

12.   Examine the causes of international opposition to apartheid and the extent to which that
      opposition contributed to the end of apartheid.

      This question expects candidates to analyse the causes of international opposition to apartheid, and
      also assess the extent to which external opposition led to the end of the apartheid system, alongside
      a discussion of the other factors that contributed to its end.

      International opposition: Factors that contributed to international condemnation of apartheid
      include: disapproval of the brutal methods used to suppress resistance against apartheid;
      international support for members of the African National Congress (ANC) who were either
      imprisoned or forced into exile; the death of Steve Biko and the way the government dealt with the
      Soweto rising; South African police were accused of shooting innocent unarmed civilians
      during protests.

      As a consequence of this sanctions were imposed; there were sporting and academic boycotts of the
      country and many foreign investors chose to withdraw from the country. Furthermore, high-profile
      meetings were held with exiled ANC leaders and the defeat of South African forces in South
      Angola contributed to the South African government’s decision to negotiate Namibian
      independence in 1990.

      Other factors: Candidates may also choose to discuss a number of other factors, such as: the
      leadership among both the Africans and Europeans in South Africa (the role of De Klerk, Nelson
      Mandela, the Sharpeville massacre etc); the role of political parties such as the ANC; the impact
      of various methods used by Africans against the system, eg demonstrations, armed struggle and
      strikes etc. Also, the psychological boost given to Black South Africans following the end of
      Portuguese rule in neighbouring countries between 1974 and 1975 could be a valid source
      of discussion.

Africa under colonialism 1890–1980

13.   Evaluate the impact that British rule had on the economic and social development of
      Nyasaland up to 1964.

      Candidates must have a clear understanding of the British rule in Nyasaland and how it affected the
      social and economic development of the region up to 1964.

      Candidates may argue that: Nyasaland lacked mineral resources; it suffered the problems of the
      settler population; the Chilembwe Rising was caused by the mistreatment of Africans on settler
      plantations; it had a range of problems with regard to economic development (absentee landlords;
      the granting of huge tracts of land to settlers); agricultural development was more beneficial to
      white farmers than it was to Africans; Africans who squatted on European land could be easily
      evicted; there was overcrowding in most areas; many Africans who had earlier relied on
      subsistence farming had to shift to cash crop growing; the government supported fish farming
      among the Africans; good means of transportation meant easy access to markets; the lack of
      industry led many Africans to move to neighbouring countries as migrant workers; education and
      medical facilities were made available; Christian churches were established. Mention can be made
      of how the African system of chiefs was interfered with. Candidates can also discuss the
      introduction of the Hut tax. It could also be mentioned that some Africans took to cash crop
      growing as an alternative to being migrant workers in neighbouring countries. Candidates can also
      mention the introduction of incentives to encourage Africans to grow cash crops like the
      introduction of tax rebates for those who grew cotton. Loss of land, which then led to
      overpopulation in some areas, can also be discussed. Candidates can discuss the differences
      between the policies of the three commissioners Sir Harry Johnstone, Manning and Smith and how
      these affected the development of the region.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

14.   To what extent did both Angola and Mozambique enjoy economic and social gains from
      Portuguese rule?

      This question expects candidates to have good knowledge of economic and social development in
      both Angola and Mozambique.

      In 1951, Angola became an overseas province of Portugal and many Portuguese were encouraged to
      settle both in Angola and Mozambique with the aim of alleviating unemployment in Portugal.
      In Angola mining and agriculture were mainly controlled by the settlers. Native inhabitants in the
      Portuguese colonies were denied the rights of being Portuguese citizens and were considered
      indigenas (as opposed to assimilado) and had limited political rights unless they were over 18,
      monogamous, fluent in Portuguese, had a recognised form of income, were educated and of
      good character.

      Most of the developments in both countries were aimed at favouring the settler population rather
      than the African inhabitants. Schools, medical facilities, roads etc were constructed, but these were
      mainly for the benefit of the Europeans. Nevertheless some Africans also benefitted in various
      ways, for example, through trade. The settlers owned huge tracts of land and were therefore key
      players in the agricultural development of the two countries. It is important to note that Africans
      gained employment in the settler farms and mines and, with time, Africans also benefited from the
      new education system; however illiteracy was still very high. Many Africans from Mozambique
      moved to neighbouring countries as migrant labourers, but there was strict surveillance of African
      activities. Cooperative societies were set up to improve the economic situation among Africans.
      It is important to note that by 1950 there were only approximately 30,000 assimilados in Angola.
      The prazo system, where enormous territories of the colony were conceded to independent
      leaseholders, and thereafter, the rule of private companies, mitigated against the economic and
      social development. The prazos and companies raised punitive taxes and used forced labour
      and neglected any infrastructural development except that which promoted their extractive
      economic model.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best

Social and economic developments in the 19th and 20th centuries 1800–1960

15.   With reference to one area studied, evaluate the impact of the spread of Christianity during
      the period 1800 to 1960.

      The question expects candidates to have good knowledge on the spread of Christianity in any one of
      the areas studied (as indicated in the guide). The emphasis of the question is on the impact of the
      spread of Christianity. Candidates should discuss both the positive and negative impact.

      Candidates should explain that missionaries were often humanitarians and this made them more
      attractive to the native populace. They did not use force to spread their Christian faith and this
      made it very appealing. Also, many Africans saw the benefits they would get through becoming
      Christians, eg getting jobs in the missionary stations, benefitting from their medical facilities etc.
      Christian missionaries also took care of the widows and orphans in society. Job opportunities were
      available in the colonial administration for Christianized, mission-educated Africans.

      The answer should touch on the social, economic and political impact of Christianity. It is
      important to note that in all areas there were established cultures and systems that, with the spread
      of Christianity, had to change. Christianity brought with it a more Westernized culture and
      whoever embraced the religion had to at least accept many parts of that culture too. One major
      impact was the spread of Western education, which slowly replaced traditional educational
      practices in many areas. Other areas where the impact could be seen were in architecture, the
      construction of churches, the development of Christian schools, the development of agriculture, and
      the development of health centres etc.

      Candidates should also explain the role of the missionaries in the introduction of legitimate trade
      and the end of the slave trade. They should be able to analyse the extent to which this
      was beneficial.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

16.   “Colonialism was the major contributing factor to the changing status of African women.”
      With reference to one area studied, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question expects candidates to have a clear understanding of the role of women in the pre-
      colonial African society of one area studied (as indicated in the guide) in order for them to be able
      to identify the changes that took place. They must then make it clear in what ways colonialism
      contributed to a change in the status of women. Other factors like Christianity can also be
      considered and the role of the traditional chiefs (for example, in embracing change could also be
      discussed).

      With colonialism came the introduction of the monetary system and, in time, this led to women
      being able to work outside the home and earning money. In traditional societies, the woman’s place
      was in the home and although women did most of the work, it was the men who usually benefited;
      ie they took the money from whatever cash crops were grown.

      With colonialism, this began to change: new jobs were created and this led to many men seeking
      employment away from their homes and in turn left women alone to fend for the children.

      Colonialism also led to the expansion of trade. This contributed to more women getting involved in
      different kinds of trade. With more markets being opened women now had the opportunity to
      participate in trade even more than they did in the more traditional societies. As far as politics was
      concerned the role of women did not change immediately. Even under colonial rule, women were
      still precluded from owning property. However, women could benefit from Western education that
      resulted from the spread of Christianity, through which practices such as early marriage and male
      polygamy were discouraged.

      It is important to note that in some societies it took longer for the role of women to change, especially
      where traditions were very strong and details will change depending on the region candidates refer to.

Nationalist and independence movements (Eastern and Central Africa)

17.   “The existence of only one political party in Tanganyika was the most significant reason why
      it achieved independence before Kenya.” Discuss.

      Candidates are expected to explain how Tanganyika, as a one party state, was able to achieve
      independence before Kenya. The candidates will be expected to discuss the other factors that
      contributed to Tanganyika achieving independence first, and these will include: the able leadership
      of Nyerere; the absence of ethnic rivalry in Tanganyika (unlike Kenya, where this was a major
      cause of disunity); the absence of a large settler population (such as existed in Kenya); the
      trusteeship status of Tanganyika that ensured that the British did everything possible to assist the
      progress towards independence; the absence of a single dominant ethnic group in Tanganyika like
      the Kikuyu in Kenya.

      On the other hand, candidates are expected to look at the factors that made it difficult for Kenya to
      achieve independence earlier. Candidates could discuss: the role of the Mau Mau rising, which
      hindered negotiations that could have been carried out with the British; the imprisonment of key
      leaders, which weakened any struggle towards an independence movement; the tribal rivalries that
      contributed to disunity and distracted Kenyans from their focus on independence; rivalry between
      the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) and
      the existence of a large settler population that was reluctant to support the idea of independence.
      The British feared the outburst of a civil war between the rival groups and were therefore not
      willing to give Kenya independence earlier.

18.   “Peaceful negotiation, rather than armed struggle, contributed to the faster achievement of
      independence.” With reference to both Zambia and Mozambique, to what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The focus of the question is to compare the pace at which independence was achieved in Zambia
      (following peaceful negotiations) and Mozambique (following armed struggle). Candidates must
      have a good understanding of independence in both countries to be able to draw a concrete
      conclusion. Candidates ought to look at other factors that also contributed to the delayed
      independence in one country compared to the other.

      Zambia achieved independence 11 years before Mozambique. As part of the Central African
      Federation, Zambia (Northern Rhodesia) witnessed protests against the Central African Federation
      with its introduction of new racial laws. These took the form of protests, strikes and boycotts.
      Kenneth Kaunda led the non-protest movements in Northern Rhodesia and was arrested between
      1959 and 1960 for his political involvement. On his release, he became the president of the United
      National Independence Party. The necessity for decolonization was seen by the government of
      Harold Macmillan when it realized the political change that was taking place in Africa. Through
      the Monckton Report, Northern Rhodesia was able to secede from the Federation in 1963. In 1964
      Zambia achieved its independence with Kenneth Kaunda as its first president. This is a clear
      example of how independence was achieved mainly through negotiations and not armed resistance.
      Candidates can bring in other factors that may have also contributed to this early independence like
      the role of leaders etc.

      In the case of Mozambique independence was achieved from the Portuguese 11 years later. It had
      to go through a long period of armed struggle since the Portuguese were not ready to grant them
      independence because of the economic benefits Portugal still reaped from the colony. Unlike
      Zambia, Mozambique had a large settler population, which made it difficult for the government to
      give in to requests for independence. South Africa, Mozambique’s neighbour was not keen on
      supporting its independence and instead sent in armed forces to assist the Portuguese fight against
      Frelimo. This African resistance led to the hardening of rules by the colonial government that made
      it difficult for the Africans to achieve independence sooner. Candidates should discuss the guerilla
      warfare that went on in Mozambique. In 1974 the Portuguese army overthrew the government.
      This led to negotiations between the new Portuguese government and Frelimo. In 1975
      Mozambique achieved independence with Samora Machel as its first president. Of course,
      Mozambique did achieve independence, but it is important to note that armed struggled prolonged
      the process.

Nationalist and independence movements (Southern and West Africa)

19.   Examine the role played by political parties in the achievement of independence in either
      Ghana or Nigeria.

      With reference to one of the mentioned countries, candidates must assess the role played by
      political parties against the wider context of the achievement of independence.

      In Ghana, candidates should talk about the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), formed in
      1947 by JB Danquah, and which called for early self-government. This party was made up mainly
      of lawyers and businessmen and Kwame Nkrumah was appointed as its general secretary. Mention
      should be made of how this party became more militant. Candidates can also mention how the
      arrest of party leaders like Kwame Nkrumah led to protests and riots and the eventual increase in
      membership of parties like the UGCC. Candidates may also discuss how newspapers and schools
      were used by political parties to propagate their ideas, perhaps partly in an attempt to use non-
      violent means to spread their ideas.

      Due to his radicalism, Nkrumah was expelled from the UGCC and he went on to form his own
      party: the Convention People’s Party (CPP). The aim of the CPP was that Ghana should achieve
      independence immediately. Candidates ought to discuss how parties like the CPP tried to
      incorporate all social classes, giving Nkrumah’s party popular support.

      When a new constitution was introduced in 1951, Nkrumah’s CPP refused to acknowledge it. With
      members of the party being arrested, including Nkrumah himself, he decided to adopt “Positive
      Action” by calling for a general strike. It is important for candidates to note that as a result of the
      political push from people like Kwame and their political parties, eventually full independence was
      granted.

      Other parties that candidates might consider include the Northern People’s Party (NPP); Muslim
      Association Party (MAP); Togoland Congress (TCP); and the National Liberation Movement
      (NLM). However, it should be recognized that the role played by these groups was minor
      compared to the CPP.

      In the case of Nigeria, it is important for candidates to note that many social and cultural societies
      became politicised and a good example of this would be the Nigerian Youth Movement (NYM)
      formed in 1934. Also in this category candidates can discuss the role played by The National
      Council for Nigeria and the Cameroon (NCNC) formed in 1944 with Herbert Macaulay as its
      president. Candidates can note that it was Igbo dominated. They can also mention that after
      Macaulay’s death in 1946, Nnamdi Azikiwe took over the presidency.

      The NCNC was the most popular political party in Nigeria in the 1940s. It is important for
      candidates to discuss the methods used by the party to put forward their agenda. Among other
      factors, they can mention that the NCNC was responsible for the protests and acted as spokesman
      for any discontent among the Nigerian people. In 1945 they supported the General Strike, while in
      1946 they led a nationwide fundraising tour.

      In 1947, they sent a representative to the United Kingdom to protest against the 1946 constitution.
      Candidates could also talk about the emergence of the Zikist movement at the time when the NCNC
      was facing a period of decline. They emphasized positive action, which included riots,
      demonstrations etc.

      With the new constitution of 1951, new political parties like the Northern People's Congress (NPC)
      emerged.

      In the 1950s it is important for candidates to note that the political parties stopped fighting against
      the government and aimed at benefitting from it. For example the NPC changed its slogan to “One
      North, one people” from “One Nigeria, one people.”

      Candidates ought to discuss the division among political parties, and how this may have contributed
      to the delay in Nigeria’s independence.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best
      fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


20.   To what extent did ethnic divisions delay the achievement of independence in Senegal and
      Guinea?

      This question expects candidates to discuss ethnicity as a key contributory factor to independence in
      the two countries, but they should also consider other factors.

      Despite it having many ethnic groups, independence for Senegal was achieved smoothly and the
      unity of some of the ethnic groups, for example the Wolof, Tukulor and Serer which had existed
      earlier contributed to this. Rivalry was not so much based on ethnic differences, but on the
      difference between those who lived in the countryside and those who lived in the urban areas.

      Guinea on the other hand suffered from the ethnic rivalries that shaped its politics. The major
      ethnic groups were the Fulani and the Malinke, but there were many other smaller ethnic groups.
      Candidates should be able to explain and assess the role that these played in the achievement of
      independence.

      In Senegal and Guinea, both the Islamic faith and French assimilation fostered a sense of unity.
      In Guinea this was enhanced by the actions of Sekou Toure who used his experience in trade
      unions, his Islamic faith and his grandfather Samori Toure’s popularity to gain the support of the
      Mandinka people. In both countries, economic development then boosted the fight for
      independence.

Post-independence politics to 2000

21.   With reference to any one country, discuss its success in dealing with the political and social
      challenges it has faced since independence.

      The country that can be addressed may be drawn from: Rwanda, Congo, Uganda, Sierra Leone etc,
      and the issues that candidates could identify might include ethnic conflict, civil wars, corruption,
      health issues, illiteracy, poverty, famine and/or high infant mortality. Candidates can treat all these
      under social and political challenges and they would be expected to explain the extent to which the
      chosen country has been successful in dealing with the issues (whilst also examining the factors that
      have hindered their success).

      In considering these factors, candidates should look at issues such as: lack of funds; high-level
      corruption (leading to funds not being used for their intended purpose); the challenge of tribalism
      that has contributed to various civil wars; high levels of illiteracy that have led to high levels of
      unemployment that has, in turn, affected the countries’ economies; some countries have huge debts.

22.   “Civil wars after independence were to be expected.” With reference to two countries, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Countries that can be addressed may include: Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Uganda,
      Congo, Mozambique, Nigeria Ethiopia, Rwanda and Sudan etc.

      The key issue is whether or not civil wars were an expected consequence of the tumult or otherwise
      of independence. Candidates should discuss the conflicts over resources such as oil and diamonds
      etc. On the political aspect they can look at the existence of multi-party systems that have caused
      rivalry in some of the countries mentioned. Here they can discuss some of the power-hungry
      leaders such as Charles Taylor, Jonas Savimbi etc. On the other hand, they can also discuss the
      existence of one-party states, some of which were near-dictatorial and which have witnessed civil
      war, such as Idi Amin’s Uganda and Mengistu’s Ethiopia.

      Candidates may also discuss other factors as causes of civil wars and these might include: the role
      of ethnicity, such as in the war in Biafra, Katanga province and the conflict between the Hutu and
      the Tutsis; the role of religion, such as in Sudan; clan rivalry as is the case in Somalia; and external
      intervention such as in Mozambique.

      After looking at all these factors, candidates must draw a conclusion as to whether or not these were
      likely to occur.

Africa, international organizations and the international community

23.   Examine the reasons for the formation and failure of the East African Community
      (1967–1977).

      The setting up of the East African Community took place after the East African countries had
      attained independence and it was on the recommendation of the Phillips Committee Report of 1967.
      Its aim was to ensure cooperation in East Africa in the areas of communication and transport,
      education, trade, banking and telecommunications. It was the hope that all three countries would
      support each other in their development.

      Candidates should give reasons for the failure of the East African community, including the fact
      that Tanzania and Uganda felt that Kenya was benefitting more than them in this arrangement.
      There were also growing differences in political ideologies, meaning that the three countries would
      find it difficult to work together. As tension increased, the countries took actions that further
      strained the relations; for example the closing of the borders. Tensions grew as a result of Idi
      Amin’s rule in Uganda, especially between Uganda and Tanzania (the latter invaded the former just
      two years after the break-up of the community).

24.   “United Nations involvement was more successful in the Congo in the 1960s than it was in
      Mozambique in the 1990s.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question calls for candidates to assess the role played by the United Nations in Congo and
      Mozambique and then decide where they think the UN was more successful. They should look at
      the social, economic and political involvement of the UN in the two countries to draw
      this conclusion.

      The UN was involved in the Congo in 1960 during the civil war. The Operation des Nations
      Unies au Congo (ONUC) was considered the largest peacekeeping operation. The operation was
      aimed at giving the Congo government support after the chaos that followed the withdrawal
      of Belgium. The UN was involved in direct conflict as they tried to seek peace among the warring
      factions, and they were successful in that they contributed to the unification of the Congo. The UN
      was criticized in Congo as it appeared to some that it had taken sides during the civil war. After the
      war they assisted in various ways, for example, through the provision of medicine, food and shelter
      to those who had been affected by the crisis.

      In Mozambique, UN intervention took place between 1992 and 1994 through the UN Observation
      Mission in Mozambique (UNOMOZ). The UN was given credit for its success in Mozambique
      through its ability to oversee the ceasefire, and also through being able to provide a framework for
      the peace process that eventually led to independence. Some of the key factors include: the UN
      played a major part in the formulation of the General Peace Agreement (GPA) which led to Renamo
      being disbanded; the GPA was to be overseen by UN peacekeeping forces and observers (the UN
      spent a huge sum of money ensuring the success of the GPA); UN operations in Mozambique
      included the removal of landmines, settlement of refugees and retraining of those who would help
      with enforcing law and order; UNOMOZ helped in the organization of Mozambique’s first
      democratic election by providing advice on the formation of political parties.

      The challenges the UN faced should also be mentioned, for example: what should be done with
      former soldiers; the problem of infrastructure (which interfered with their humanitarian assistance);
      various bureaucratic obstacles.
