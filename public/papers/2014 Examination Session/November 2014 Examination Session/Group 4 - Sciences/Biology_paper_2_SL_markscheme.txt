Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
         awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
        expression of relevant ideas with clarity
        structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg: within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).
