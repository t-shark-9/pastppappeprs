Mark Allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

          Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
           a semi-colon (;).

          An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

          Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

          If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

          Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
           got wrong.

          Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
           minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
           grammatical accuracy.

          Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
           the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
           be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue          Guidance
 Answering      • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity   • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses     eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 prescribed       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 in the         • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 questions        explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                  This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

                   Award [1 mark] for showing internal pointers.

            (ii)   Award up to [3 marks max].
                   Temporary pointer should be set to point to the beginning of the list;
                   Follow the internal pointers;
                   And compare the data in the node pointed to by the temporary pointer with
                   the searched data;
                   If found stop searching;
                   If the end of the list is reached then the searched data is not on the list; [3 marks]

      (c)   Award up to [4 marks max].
            If the name to be deleted is placed in a node which has two children then find the
            replacement node (the largest value in its left sub-tree / the smallest value in its
            right sub-tree) and its parent node;
            If the replacement node is either the leaf node or has one child;
            Set the data fields in the node to be deleted to the data value in the replacement
            node;
            Delete the replacement node;
            If the replacement node to be deleted is a leaf node then just set the pointer in its
            parent node to null;
            If the replacement node to be deleted has one child then set the pointer in its
            parent node to point to its child;                                                    [4 marks]

      (d)   Award up to [3 marks max].
            A linked list takes n comparisons to find a name, average search time is
            proportional to number of elements;
            When the binary tree is well balanced, it takes log2n comparisons to find a name
            (no more than n comparisons);
            So, a binary tree is usually more efficient, however in extreme cases will only take
            as long as a linked list;                                                            [3 marks]
