 These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered
 as an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must
 rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded
 as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested
 here should be rewarded appropriately.

Question 1

This question asks candidates to compare a diary entry by Samuel Pepys, September 2, 1666 to a
home page news report, “Conditions cool as fires devastate Tasmania” from the online Australian
Broadcasting Corporation news service, January 4, 2013, both of which concern accounts of
incidents caused by a devastating fire.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• discuss some of the commonalities of the two texts, such as the coverage of the fire, the inclusion
  of first-hand accounts, the giving of locations and conditions of the fire, the significance of wind
  and water
• discuss some of the things that clearly distinguish one text from the other, such as the differences
  in time and place and the resulting cultural/contextual implications, the personal and narrative
  nature of the diary account as opposed to the more objective third person news account, and the
  differences of purpose and audience that are implied by “diary” and “news service”
• examine the two text types, noting some techniques of each (eg, manner of indicating time and
  place, points of view, use of language, organization of information, titles, headings, links,
  photographs, etc) and discussing the differences in the effects these techniques create
• consider what a devastating fire reveals about the human predicament in two different cultures.


A good to excellent analysis may also:

• consider further the commonalities of the texts, observing, perhaps, that in both instances human
  intervention is at a disadvantage against the powers of nature, that the emotive power of the texts
  is vested in personal accounts, and that there is a clear distinction between the point of view of
  those involved in the peril (the Lord Mayor and David from Primrose Sands) and those out of
  harm's way (Pepys and ABC news writer)
• offer a more thorough and detailed analysis of the two text types noting for example that the
  diary entry uses highly descriptive diction, active verbs, transitions marked by “so” that build in
  intensity and noting, perhaps, that the news article is structured around the title with a balance of
  good news and bad news, and that the pictures, the “Gallery” and the other embedded links open
  up the account, as do the multiple points of view
• offer a detailed analysis of the contexts of the two texts considering, perhaps, the differences of
  handling a crisis in a culture dependent on orders from a king and a privileged few, as opposed to
  a culture where there are community services and media to assist people
• offer a more thorough consideration of audience and purpose, taking note of the fact that the
  diary was published more than 100 years after the writer’s death.

Question 2

This question asks candidates to compare a cartoon essay by Darryl Cunningham from
Science Tales: Lies, Hoaxes, and Scams (2012), to letters to the editor on “Dire Predictions About
Climate Change” from The New York Times, 15 May 2012, both of which explore climate change.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• note the commonalities of the two texts, such as the focus on climate change, the controversy
  over global warming, the attempt on the part of all to persuade the reader to a particular point
  of view, the global nature of the problem, the use of point of view and perspective to make a
  case, etc
• note some of the distinctions between the two texts, such as the use of a cartoon as a vehicle to
  explore the ideas of climate change as opposed to the juxtaposition of opinions in the letters of
  the op-ed column, the explanatory approach of the cartoon as opposed to the use of assertion in
  the opinion letters, but assertions which collectively offer a somewhat balanced range of
  opinions held by the newspaper readers, the more “entertaining” or calm approach of the
  cartoon as opposed to the much more heated nature of the letters to the editor, and the more
  pointed discussion of economic concerns in the op-ed letters than the implications about the role
  of economics in the cartoon
• comment on the shared contexts of time and place for these two texts
• discuss the two text types, analyzing some features of each and the effects of those features in
  regard to audience and purpose, eg, the cartoon as “essay,” the sense of “voice,” the use of
  picture, perspective and scale to convey meaning, captions, use of a stimulus, prose style, format,
  tone, single versus multiple points of view, etc
• discuss some of the issues evident in the cartoon and the letters: individualism,
  environmentalism, capitalism, education, self-interest versus global interest, etc, and the way
  they are presented
• discuss differences of purpose as deduced from the effects of the features of the two text types.


A good to excellent analysis may also:

• consider the juxtaposition of these two text types, that while the newspaper may hope to offer
  “balance” in its editorial choice of which letter to print in order to include an array of opinions
  about a controversial issue, the letters may seem to underscore the early premise of the cartoon
  essay, that forming opinions on local or current issues is not helpful when discussing a topic of
  enormous global and temporal implications
• offer a more thorough and perceptive analysis of the techniques (and their effects) of the two text
  types, considering that the cartoon offers a variety of approaches (voice, pictures, drawings,
  statistics, details, etc) and perspectives (local/global, past/present, far/near, forest/ skyscrapers,
  etc) creating numerous layers of meaning, and considering the individual style, tone and bias of
  the letters to the editor
• examine in greater depth and detail the contexts of the two texts and what these contexts imply
  about the issue of climate change

• offer a more detailed and perceptive interpretation of audience and purpose: perhaps
  commenting on the title of Cunningham’s book, or the fact that in the cartoon audience is
  implied to be the reader, but also a smiling child and a penguin, expanding the possible purposes
  of the text, and perhaps that while the op-ed piece clearly focuses on readers of The New York
  Times editorial pages, the positions of some of the writers may suggest further impacts.
