                                 Core Theme – Patterns and Change

                                            SECTION A

1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Describe the population structure of this country.                                     [3]

           Any two valid, distinct and descriptive points for [2 marks] plus [1 mark] for
           quantification/use of data from the x/horizontal axis.

           Possible descriptions include:
           Few dependents; large economically active group; imbalanced gender ratio; 15–64
           years old mainly male; youthful and elderly groups are more balanced.

           Comments on rates or life expectancy etc. are explanations as opposed to
           description and should not be credited.

     (b)   Suggest one reason for the structure of the economically active population.            [2]

           Migrants coming into the country are overwhelmingly male [2 marks].

     (c)   Explain three socio-economic impacts of an anti-natal policy in one named
           country.                                                                  [2+2+2]

           Award [1+1 marks] for each valid/distinct socio-economic impact, provided that it is
           developed by means of explanation and/or detail.

           Possibilities can be positive or negative and may include (for example, using
           China’s One Child Policy):

           Skewed sex ratio; no siblings or aunts or uncles; little emperor syndrome; aging
           population with only child having to support two parents and four grandparents;
           forced abortions.

           Estimate that policy prevented more than 300 million births; avoided Malthusian
           catastrophe; infant mortality fell; well educated population as families could
           afford schooling; may have helped contribute to China’s recent economic growth.

           If no valid country is named award a maximum of [4 marks].

           Demographic or environmental comment must linked to socio-economic impact.
                                                –4–               M14/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   (i)    With reference to the graph, identify which sub-target was furthest
                  from being met in 2008.                                                         [1]

                  Target C / Pregnant women attended at least once by medical personnel.

           (ii)   State the Millennium Development Goal to which the sub-target you
                  identified in part (i) relates.                                                 [1]

                  Improve maternal health or Millennium Development Goal 5.

     (b)   State any two other Millennium Development Goals that are not represented
           in these graphs.                                                                     [1+1]

           Any two of the following:
            reduce child mortality
            promote gender equality and empower women
            combat disease (HIV, AIDS, malaria)
            environmental sustainability
            global partnership
            eradicate hunger (allow even though with poverty).

           The responses do not have to have this exact wording, eg “combat HIV” would be
           acceptable as would “sustainability” and “cooperation between countries”.

     (c)   Suggest two reasons why primary school enrollment as a percentage has
           increased.                                                                           [2+2]

           Award [1+1 marks] for each valid/distinct reason, provided that it is developed by
           means of detail and/or exemplification.

           Possibilities include:
            countries or regions abolishing school fees/eg Kenya abolished primary school
             fees in 2003 increased urbanization/increasing access to services such as
             schools
            schools offering meals/attracting students from families with low food security
            improved sanitation/attracting more girls
            improved infrastructure/ increases access.

           eg Some governments are starting to prioritize education and are increasing
           funding [1 mark] this results in more schools being built increasing
           overall enrollment [1 mark].
                                          –5–               M14/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Explain two reasons why aid may not help reduce disparities.                    [2+2]

      Award [1 mark] for each basic explanation, with additional [1 mark] for
      extension and/or exemplification.

      Aid can be interpreted broadly – allow food, emergency and financial aid.

      Possibilities include:
       increases dependency/especially food aid eg Ethiopia
       corruption/aid may be utilized by an elite and not filter down to those who
        need it
       may be tied aid/conditions attached
       if aid is financial/it could increase the debt burden
       aid may be too short-term/does not have the duration to be effective
       top-down aid projects/may not target the poorest communities.
                                               –6–               M14/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Describe the pattern of high physical water scarcity shown on the map.            [3]

           Any of the following for [1 mark] each:
            a valid comment on latitudinal location
            mainly found in the northern hemisphere
            especially in Northern and Eastern Africa and parts of Southern Africa
            Middle East
            SW and/or Central Asia
            SW North America
            West coast of South America.

     (b)   Explain why some of the world’s arid areas are not areas of physical water
           scarcity.                                                                         [3]

           Physical water scarcity occurs when water resource consumption is approaching
           or has reached unsustainable levels/demand exceeds 60 % of usable supply.
           Award [1 mark] for describing this concept. The world’s arid areas have little
           available water, but usually have low population/density [1 mark] and therefore
           water usage/demand may still not exceed sustainable levels/supply [1 mark].

     (c)   Explain the energy flows involved in the greenhouse effect.                       [5]

           Any of the following:
            incoming solar radiation/short wave radiation/insolation
            some reaches the Earth’s surface
            the Earth’s surface re-emits terrestrial/longwave radiation
            some of this energy/radiation is absorbed/trapped by greenhouse gases
            a little energy is lost to space
            naming two or more valid greenhouse gases.

           There is no requirement to explain the enhanced greenhouse effect.

           A valid annotated diagram explaining five of the above is equally acceptable.

4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   Describe the relationship shown on the graph.                                              [3]

           The relationship is negative/inverse or the lower the income inequality, the more
           recycling takes place [1 mark]. Use of valid example(s) to exemplify this
           relationship [1 mark]. Identification of an anomaly [1 mark].

     (b)   Explain two environmental benefits of recycling.                                         [2+2]

           Award [1 mark] for each          valid,    distinct   benefit,    and   [1 mark]   for
           explanation/exemplification.

           Possibilities may include:
            recycling means that fewer non-renewable resources will be needed or used
             [1 mark], if fewer new materials are made from scratch, the carbon footprint
             may be lower [1 mark]
            recycling reduces solid waste and the need for waste disposal/landfill [1 mark],
             less green space lost/less harm to wildlife/less methane [1 mark]
            recycling usually saves on the energy costs associated with transport [1 mark],
             since non-renewable resources often travel further to the factory than recycled
             resources [1 mark].

     (c)   Explain two disadvantages of one named source of renewable energy.                       [2+2]

           Award [1 mark] for each            valid     disadvantage        and    [1 mark]   for
           explanation/exemplification.

           The disadvantages depend on the choice of energy source.

           Possible disadvantages:
           The cost of development; the distance that power (electricity) has to be
           transmitted from where the resource is available; the reduction in landscape
           aesthetic values (eg, in the case of land-based wind farms); unreliable supply,
           dependent on weather and other conditions, meaning that the resource is not
           available at all times, or not available to meet peak demand times.

           For example, if a candidate chooses “solar power”, the two disadvantages might
           be: (a) not suited to certain regions of the world (eg, higher latitude areas), or
           certain seasons (winter), and (b) installation costs remain relatively expensive.

           If no valid named renewable energy source, but disadvantages are analysed, award
           a maximum of [2 marks].

           Accept nuclear power as a renewable energy source.

5.   “Investing in gender equality is the most effective strategy to promote economic
     and social development.” Discuss this statement.                                              [15]

     There are many possible approaches to this question; each should be assessed on its
     merits.

     Many responses are likely to focus on the positive aspects that improved gender
     equality has on societies and economies. These include the role of women in
     influencing trends in demography (via age of marriage, number of children),
     employment (via presence in the workforce), education, health care and politics,
     among others. It is also possible that reference is made to the Millennium Development
     Goals, three of which directly focus on improving the status of women. It is also
     possible that candidates will refer to composite indexes of development and link
     strategies to empowering women with these indexes.

     Discussion may also include some mention of at least one other strategy that promotes
     economic and social development such as trade and market access, debt relief, aid and
     remittances.

     It is also possible that responses may take an alternative approach and consider that
     investing in gender equality is not the most effective strategy to promote development.
     They would need to make their case and be able to describe and explain other strategies
     that they consider to be more effective.

     Responses that are generalized, with few or no examples, are unlikely to advance
     beyond band D.

     Responses that offer a sound discussion with examples and arrive at a clear conclusion
     either agreeing or disagreeing with the viewpoint are likely to be awarded band E or above.

6.   “Rapid population growth is the main cause of soil degradation and reduced
     biodiversity.” Discuss this statement.                                                     [15]

     Responses should show some understanding of what is meant by rapid population
     growth and should be able to explain what is meant by soil degradation and reduced
     biodiversity. The main focus of the response should then be on discussing the extent to
     which both of these environmental issues are the outcome of increased population
     growth. The scale of discussion will depend on the examples chosen.

     It is expected that responses will tend to give a balanced view:
      explaining how both soil degradation and biodiversity are caused by population
         growth: loss of habitat, deforestation to make way for human settlements,
         infrastructure, agricultural land to feed more people, growth of urban areas in both
         number and size
      explaining how factors other than population growth are contributing to the loss of
         biodiversity and soil degradation: increased standard of living, increased
         consumption, oil dependence, climate change, potential physical factors.

     Responses that are generalized, with few or no examples, are unlikely to advance
     beyond band D.

     Responses presenting accurate, specific and well detailed knowledge on the causes of
     reduced biodiversity and soil degradation and discussing the extent to which population
     growth is the main cause are likely to reach band E or F if the answer makes use of
     effective examples.

7.   “The world is far too dependent on oil.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?                                                                              [15]

     Candidates are expected to consider the importance of oil in today’s world as the major
     source of energy as well as its significance for geo-politics. Responses are also
     expected to consider the changing importance of other energy sources.

     Most responses are likely to focus on the finite/non-renewable nature of oil stocks and
     argue that the use of renewable resources is urgently needed in order to guarantee
     sufficient energy availability for the future and to mitigate the adverse effects of
     dependence on oil, especially its adverse environmental impacts such as pollution and
     global climate change. It is anticipated that more than one non-renewable resource
     would be considered, but the discussion of non-renewable sources need not be balanced
     for this approach to reach the highest markbands, provided any examples given are valid
     and well developed.

     Some candidates may argue (correctly) that the world’s oil reserves are currently as
     high or higher than they have ever been, and that therefore there is less pressing need to
     develop alternatives than supporters of renewable energy sources advocate. To reach
     the highest markbands such an approach would need to be well-balanced (taking into
     account environmental impacts, especially) as well as well-evidenced, with reference to
     newly discovered deposits being added to reserves, to the development of less
     conventional sources of oil such as tar/oil sands, and to improved technologies that have
     enabled higher effective extraction rates.

     Alternative approaches may be equally valid and should be considered on their merits.

     Responses that are generalized, with little or no data, figures or examples, are unlikely
     to advance beyond band D.

     At band F, the conclusion should be well-grounded in evidence or will demonstrate
     different perspectives of the ways in which dependency is a problem.
