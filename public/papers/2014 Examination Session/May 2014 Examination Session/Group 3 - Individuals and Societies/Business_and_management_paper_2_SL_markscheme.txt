                                             SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the term market share.                                                         [2 marks]

           Market share refers to the percentage or proportion of a particular market
           represented by an individual company’s sales (measured either in value [$ or €, for
           example] or number of units). In the case of LE, the company’s sales revenue has
           grown faster than the market for commercial lighting and faster than the market
           for energy efficient commercial lighting. As a result, its market share in both
           markets has increased.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Describe one diseconomy of scale for LE.                                              [2 marks]

           Diseconomies of scale refer to increases in per unit cost because of increased
           complexity that can occur with growth. One example from the stimulus of a
           diseconomy of scale is the ever more costly administration of manufacturing in 12
           small factories in Algiers. If LE operated out of one large factory, managing
           deliveries to the factory, organizing the work schedules, and managing shipments
           of finished product would presumably be more streamlined than managing these
           processes through 12 different sites. Other diseconomies of scale relevant to LE
           include:
           • financial/transactional diseconomies of scale (related to the having use of 12
              small factories versus one large factory)
           • technical diseconomies of scale (engineers may have to move from one factory
              to the next in resolving technical issues, driving up costs)
           • inventory management.

           Accept any other diseconomy of scale appropriately described.


           Award [1 mark] for a basic description or an identification of a diseconomy of
           scale that conveys partial knowledge and understanding of the concept of
           diseconomy of scale.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear description based on LE that conveys knowledge
           and understanding similar to the answer above. Though the candidate does not
           have to say “increases in per unit cost”, to receive [2 marks] a candidate must
           convey that idea in the description.

(c)   Calculate for LE:

      For parts (i) to (v) accept properly rounded numbers to 1 place right of decimal
      point and any answer specified as acceptable in the markscheme.

      If 1 place to the right of the decimal is zero and the candidate correctly rounds to
      an integer, the response is correct.

      Do not penalize candidates if they omit the € sign, days, percentage sign, or other
      appropriate symbol, nor if they use the incorrect symbol.

      (i)    the gross profit for 2009 (figure Y).                                           [1 mark]

      (ii)   the gross profit margin for 2013.                                               [1 mark]

             €58m
                  = 0.6237 . Gross profit margin for 2013: 62.37 %

             Accept 62.37 %, 62.36 % or 62.4 %.


             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer (working not required).

      (iii) the stock turnover for 2009 and 2013.                                            [2 marks]

             €0.94m

              €35m

             Or may be calculated as follows:
             €11.5m
                     = 12.23 times in a year (2009)
             €0.94m

              €35m
                    = 8.10 times in a year (2013)
             €4.32m

             If the candidate calculates in terms of days, they may round to 30 and 45 and
             receive full marks.

             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer for 2009 and [1 mark] for the correct
             answer for 2013. Award a maximum of [2 marks].

(d)   Comment on the decline in liquidity at LE.                                             [3 marks]

      Between 2009 and 2013, liquidity declined at LE: the current ratio fell from 2.96
      to 1.41 and the acid test ratio from 2.47 to 1.02. Based upon the information
      provided, the main cause of the decrease in liquidity was the slower turnover of
      stock (stock turnover in days increased from 29.83 days in 2009 to 45.05 days in
      2013). The probable cause of the increase in stock turnover was certain
      inefficiencies that resulted from growth because the firm did not have one large
      manufacturing facility but rather had numerous small facilities scattered around
      Algiers. Whereas LE’s liquidity situation at present is not a crisis, the trend is
      worrisome and, if it continues, LE will have genuine liquidity problems.


      Award [1 mark] if the candidate comments on the decline in liquidity such that
      their comment conveys some understanding of liquidity.

      Award [2 marks] if the candidate (1) comments that liquidity at LE is worsening
      and (2) supports the response with some numerate details and/or addresses that the
      liquidity situation is adequate and not yet a genuine problem (though soon
      will be).

      Award [3 marks] if, in addition to the above, the candidate specifically links the
      decrease in liquidity to the slower stock turnover or the diseconomies of scale that
      have resulted from rapid growth, or makes some other relevant important and
      insightful comment.

      Maximum award: [3 marks].

(e)   Analyse communication at LE.                                                          [5 marks]

      The positives of communication at LE are many:
      • The company appears to have a “working language”: French.
      • Whereas the workers in Algeria prefer Arabic, most have at least basic French.
        It is probably rare when a worker speaks to customers.
      • The supervisors in Algeria are salaried and speak both French and Arabic well
        and thus can communicate with French speakers (customers, vendors,
        employees in Luxembourg, etc) and to workers in Arabic.
      • French is one of the major European languages.

      There are some negatives of communication at LE:
      • The business operates on two continents and, in Algeria, it operates in twelve
        different factories.     Communication between these disparate sites is
        complicated and dependent on ICT, which can have problems from time to
        time.
      • The fact that there are occasional problems with the IT infrastructure in Algeria
        causes some inefficiencies in operation.
      • There are cultural differences in non-verbal communication between Algeria
        and Europe. On occasions when someone from Algeria travels to Europe or a
        European customer wants to see production facilities in Algeria, some training
        of the Algerian staff may be necessary.


      Candidates are not required to know or refer to historical or cultural geographic
      factors (that French, for example, is an official language in Luxembourg [though
      that is certainly implied] or that Algeria has had a long relationship with France
      and the Franco-phone world). Candidates may raise these points if they know
      them, but they should not be awarded marks for knowledge of these areas but
      rather the marks should be awarded for business knowledge.

      If the response is a one-sided generally relevant approach with no analysis,
      award a maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)    (i)   Define the term pressure group.                                               [2 marks]

                  A pressure group is a formal organization, an informal organization, or
                  diverse and scattered people and organizations that (1) has common interest
                  and (2) tries to influence governments, businesses, or public opinion in
                  favour of or in opposition to causes, generally related to social or
                  environmental issues or related to human and civil rights.


                  Candidates are not expected to word the definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above. A candidate may deepen their
                  response through exemplification. Exemplification alone, when expressed
                  in a complete sentence with an action verb, could earn [1 mark]. However,
                  “Greenpeace is a pressure group”, with nothing else, would not earn even
                  a mark.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   Describe the production method known as batch production.                     [2 marks]

                  Batch production is a manufacturing technique in which goods are produced
                  in groups (batches) and not in a continuous stream. Batch production can be
                  useful for small businesses who cannot afford to run continuous production
                  lines.

                  N.B. Non-native speakers especially, may not know a synonym for batch.

                  Do not accept tautological answers: “Batch production is when the product
                  is made in batches”; a response such as this, all by itself, would earn
                  [0 marks]. However, if a candidate can describe batch production (a batch

(b)   Calculate for Klar’s new flavoured drinks (show all your workings):

      (i)    the break-even level of output.                                             [2 marks]

                                  Total fixed costs

        BEP          = 200 000 bottles
                    (1.6 − 0.4)


             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer and [1 mark] for working, up to a
             maximum of [2 marks].

      (ii)   the margin of safety if it operates at full capacity.                       [2 marks]

             Margin of safety = Expected sales level – Break-even sales level =
             3000 000 − 200 000 = 2800 000 bottles


             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer and [1 mark] for working, up to a
             maximum of [2 marks].

      (iii) the profit or loss if it operates at full capacity.                          [2 marks]

             Profit = SR – TC = (1.6 × 3000 000) – (240 000 + (0.4 × 3000 000)) = 4800 000 –1440 000
             Profit = $3360 000


             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer and [1 mark] for working, up to a
             maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Construct a fully labelled break-even chart for Klar’s new flavoured drinks.              [5 marks]




      Award marks as follows:
      [1 mark] for each appropriately labelled axis (the vertical axis must include
      reference to both costs and revenue) – award a maximum of [2 marks].
      [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.
      [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total costs curve.
      [1 mark] for the identification of the break-even level of output.


      N.B. If candidates use the word “sales” instead of “revenue” accept. In many
      places in the world, sales and revenue are virtually synonyms, a least in everyday
      use.

      Award [0 marks] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than
      [3 marks] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to scale.
      If a candidate produces a chart with no figures (which prevents determination if it
      is to scale) but in other respects it is fully accurate, award a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the break-even point and
      label the arrow. However, accept as an “accurately labelled” break-even point, a
      vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point provided that the line is
      labelled “break-even point”.

(d)   Analyse one advantage and one disadvantage for Klar of having ethical
      objectives.                                                           [5 marks]

      To support its ethical objectives of being environmentally friendly, Klar has
      decided to use reusable glass bottles instead of plastic containers. With such a
      decision, Klar can gain on brand image and reputation, which might lead to an
      increased customer base and support from government and environmental
      groups. A growing trend among consumers is consume products that will not
      damage the environment. However, products that do not damage the environment
      usually cost more.

      If Klar wants to support the environment by using glass bottles, they must do one
      of two things:
      • Pass the higher cost on to consumers. However, with price still a determinant
         component in choice for most of the customers, under this option Klar must
         persuade price-conscious consumers that the more expensive Klar products are
         worth it because it helps protect the environment or Klar runs the risk of losing
         market share, lowering profits, and weakening returns.
      • Absorb the higher cost of the containers themselves, lowering margins and
         lowering return on investment (ROI). However, shareholders of Klar may
         object to this approach, regardless of how much good this approach does for
         the environment.

      The issue for Klar is one of time horizon. Though some consumers are getting
      more conscientious about pollution issues and are probably more open to adopt
      responsible consumption habits, for the majority of consumers, price is still what
      matters. In the long run, however, if consumer trends continue, most consumers
      will probably become conscientious about environmentally friendly products.

      Balance, on this question, is more than analysing the binarity of good
      reputation/image versus higher cost. Balance comes from deepening their
      response by extending their reasoning. For example,
      • bringing into account the fact that for most consumers, price is the determining
         factor
      • giving consideration to the time element (short-term versus long-term)
      • extending the higher cost implications out to different stakeholders groups,
         such as shareholders
      • accept any other relevant extension.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

                                               SECTION B

3.   (a) Identify one advantage and one disadvantage of mass production for the
         American company.                                                      [2 marks]

           Advantages of mass production include:
           • per unit cost of production is low (by comparison to other forms of production)
           • the rate of production tends to be high
           • products are uniform and often of very high quality
           • most workers do not require a high skill level – easy to find workers
           • machines tend to make fewer errors than humans.

           Disadvantages of mass production include:
           • production runs typically must be of great volume to reach break-even
           • mass production lacks the flexibility of other forms of production
           • mass produced items do not have anything unique about them
           • workers may take less pride in work and overall pride in the business
           • mass production is capital intensive
           • production in large quantities can be financially risky if the product fails to sell.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage. If a candidate offers as a
           disadvantage something to the effect of “quality is likely to be lower,” do not
           award a mark. All by itself, that assertion is inaccurate.


           Mark as 1 + 1.

           Award [1 mark] for an advantage identified and [1 mark] for a disadvantage
           identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain one difficulty that the American company may face when entering
           the South African market.                                               [2 marks]

           When entering the South African market, the American company could face a
           number of difficulties based upon differences in:
           • business cultures and practices
           • economies and social practices
           • exchange rate/trade barriers
           • political culture and laws
           • the cultures of South Africa and the United States.

           Accept any other relevant difficulty that the American company may face.


           Award [1 mark] for identification of a difficulty that the American company could
           face. Award [2 marks] for a full, clear explanation of how it will be a difficulty.

(c)   Explain two possible purposes of penetration pricing.                                   [4 marks]

      Penetration pricing has many purposes. It can:
      • allow a business to acquire rapidly market share
      • catch existing businesses in the market by surprise and not allow them time
        to react
      • create satisfied early adopter customers who know that they are getting a
        favourable price now and that prices will eventually rise as more people want
        the product
      • discourage any potential new competitor.

      In many cases, candidates are going to say something to the effect “gaining
      customers” or “increasing market share”. Be cautious so that marks are not
      awarded for what is basically a repetition. The second idea must be distinct.
      However, the candidate may break penetration pricing into two time segments; the
      first being to get customers/gain market share and the second being (a) building
      brand loyalty, for example, or (b) increasing profitability by raising prices because
      there is now a loyal customer base.

      Accept any other relevant purpose of penetration pricing with an explanation.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for identification of a relevant and correct type of purpose of
      penetration pricing and [1 mark] for its explanation. Award a maximum of
      [2 marks] for each purpose.

(d)   Examine the roles of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation of the
      workers at KP and at the factory opened by the American company.          [5 marks]

      Intrinsic motivation refers to a motivational basis that is within an individual and
      corresponds to tasks that are inherently rewarding. In situations where intrinsic
      motivation is at work, external incentives are not required to get the employee to
      perform the tasks or do the work. Extrinsic motivation refers to situations where
      the tasks that must be performed are not inherently motivating and workers have
      no internal desire to complete them. However, for rewards, typically pay and
      fringe benefits, workers can be extrinsically motivated to perform certain tasks.
      KP has traditionally operated by reliance on intrinsic motivation: workers were
      not paid very much, but had job security and were encouraged to take their time
      to make the most beautiful pottery that they could. The American company, on
      the other hand, mass produces large quantities of pottery and only a small
      number of employees are involved in the design. Most employees will work
      in automated manufacturing and warehouse processing that will require little
      creativity.    Because the work will not be intrinsically motivating, the
      American company will rely on external rewards: good wages with fringe benefits.

      Balance, in this context, means addressing both types of motivation and
      conveying some sense of the strengths and weaknesses of motivating workers
      intrinsically or extrinsically. To receive [5 marks] a candidates’ answer must have
      significant detailed reference to the stimulus or some detailed reference plus
      explicit use of a motivational theory.

      If a candidate clearly knows the meaning of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation
      and correctly applies to the stimulus with some detail, award a maximum of
      [4 marks].

      If a candidate accurately describes intrinsic motivational approaches at KP and
      accurately describes extrinsic motivational strategies at the American company
      but does not label/call them intrinsic and extrinsic, award [2 marks].

(e)   Evaluate the impact on South Africa of the American company opening a
      factory in Johannesburg.                                              [7 marks]

      The arrival of the American pottery company in South Africa could have a
      significant impact on the host country. Some implications of the arrival will not
      be welcomed:
      • small companies, like KP, will face new competitive pressures and could
         possibly be put out of business
      • the hand-made craft tradition in pottery could die (at least be weakened) and be
         lost and replaced with mass production
      • profits will be directed out of the country
      • small, African owned businesses such as KP could be weakened or altogether
         cease to exist
      • assuming the success of the American company, there will be “an
         Americanization” of South African culture, at least in the area of pottery.

      On the other hand, the presence of the American company will also have some
      positive implications:
      • the presence of the new and modern American facility will put pressure on
        South African pottery businesses to modernize, which in the long run could
        make them more competitive and, thus, viable for a longer period of time
      • the greater uniformity of the product (via mass production) and the reduction in
        per unit cost may appeal to many South African consumers – they could feel
        positive out of purchasing these types of goods
      • the decision by the American business to locate in South Africa, rather than in
        some other country in southern Africa, means that South Africa will get the
        benefit of 150 new, well-paying positions
      • the construction of the new manufacturing facility in South Africa represents a
        major capital investment in the country.

4.   (a)   Identify two variable costs for Magda’s flower business.                                [2 marks]

           Relevant variable costs for Magda’s flower business include:
           • the flowers she buys before reselling them
           • the energy bills, for example, electricity bill for heating the shop will be higher
             in winter
           • the fuel for the vehicle of the assistant who delivers flowers in the morning
           • supplies (decorative tissue paper, ribbons, boxes, vases, etc)
           • accept transporting but not cost of vehicle.

           Accept any other relevant variable cost.

           N.B. Do not accept wages (of part-time employees).


           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct variable cost identified up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain the meaning of the sentence: “Magda’s small business has only one
           source of revenue”.                                                       [2 marks]

           Magda’s flower business follows a simple business model: she resells flowers; this
           is, however, the only strand of revenue for her business: if one day she has no
           customer who wants to buy flowers, the business will not earn any money that day.
           She could have other sources of revenue, for example, selling other goods
           (eg greetings cards, gifts, accessories) or services (eg teaching flower
           arrangements at a local adult college), that way she would be less dependent on
           just selling flowers.


           Candidates are not expected to word their explanation exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic answer that shows partial knowledge and
           understanding of the topic of sources of revenue.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear explanation of the sentence.

(c)   Using Magda’s flower business, distinguish between “just-in-case” and
      “just-in-time” methods of stock control.                              [4 marks]

      A “just-in-case” method of stock control means that a business needs to have a
      certain amount of stock to be able to supply any product to a possible customer.
      If Magda joins Interflora, she will need to have a high number of flowers in stock,
      which is likely to be expensive, especially as flowers cannot be stored for long
      periods: they wither and decay. This is easier in some industries, keeping large
      amounts of stock, just in case (literally) someone asked.

      A “just-in-time” method of stock control is different. It means that a business is
      able to get hold of some products if the need arises. For example, Magda could
      have a supplier of all types of flowers in the nearby town. If someone orders her
      red roses in the morning, she can arrange this for the same day in the afternoon, as
      one of the part-time assistants could drive there and get the flowers.

      Accept any other relevant answer.


      [1 to 2 marks]
      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some knowledge of stock control
      methods. Award [2 marks] for an answer that refers to the difference between
      just-in-case and just-in-time stock control at a generic, theoretical level.

      It is possible to get one method of stock control correct, with application to the
      stimulus, but not get the other stock control method correct and earn [2 marks].
      [1 mark] for the correct method and [1 mark] for correct application.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      Award [3 marks] for an answer that combines “theory” (ie definitions) and
      “practice” (ie reference to Magda’s flower business). Award [4 marks] for an
      answer that clearly distinguishes between just-in-case and just-in-time stock
      control with reference to both Magda’s flower business , and offers some other
      element to the response that deepens it such as:
      • relevant reference to another business.
      • Some elaboration on implications (for example, just-in-case increases working
         capital requirements)
      • A brief explanation of which method is more appropriate for Magda’s business.

(d)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for Magda of joining an
      international franchise such as Interflora.                      [5 marks]

      Joining an international franchise such as Interflora has several advantages for
      Magda. She would benefit from a wide existing network of customers and
      suppliers. She would benefit from the brand name and well-established marketing
      methods. She could also receive some training from the franchisor, which could
      help her improve professionally (this may be important as she left school at 18,
      when she was young).

      However, there are some disadvantages too. Joining the franchise would cost her
      money, probably high initial joining fees plus a percentage of the sales revenue of
      the flower business. She might also be tied up by specific constraints
      (for example, about what she is allowed to sell, flowers or other products);
      she could lose some of her freedom (customers like the fact that she is creative,
      but she might not be able to be as creative in the future).

      The balance required for higher marks refers to the need to analyse both
      advantages and disadvantages.


      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(e)   Recommend to Magda one of the three methods of external growth that she
      has considered.                                                         [7 marks]

      Three methods of external growth are mentioned in the stimulus: a joint venture
      with a local wedding organizer, a strategic alliance with a garden centre, a merger
      with another florist. Candidates may compare and contrast their relative
      advantages and disadvantages, for example, a merger with another florist means
      that Magda would lose her independence yet stay in the sector that she knows and
      loves, whereas the joint venture with the local wedding organizer is a form of
      product development (to use Ansoff matrix) in a sector that Magda does not know
      at all, though it could be financially very good in the long term, through new
      business opportunities for Magda (flower arrangements for weddings and, later,
      other occasions too).

      An important aspect of the question is about Magda’s legal status: Magda could
      still remain a sole trader (for example, a strategic alliance would not affect this)
      but some other arrangements might be necessary (for example, a status of
      partnership of the two florists might be best in the case of a merger). Ultimately,
      all three options could be recommended (ie there is no right/wrong answer).

      If no meaningful reference/attention is given to the business structure (details of a
      joint venture, strategic alliance, or a merger), award a maximum of [2 marks].

      If there is reference/attention to the business structure (details of a joint venture,
      strategic alliance, or a merger) is present but limited, award a maximum of
      [3 marks] if the discussion of the business venture (with wedding planner, garden
      centre, or another florist) is basic. Award a maximum of [4 marks] if the present-
      but-limited reference/attention to the business structure is complemented with a
      more detailed consideration of the business venture.

      For [5 marks] or more, the candidate must discuss in some detail the business
      structure.

      Candidates do not have to address all three options. They may, or they may
      address only one or two options. Evidence of evaluation can occur with a detailed
      consideration of one option or a less detailed but comparative consideration of all
      three options.

      Accept any relevant substantiated recommendation.


      If a candidate does not refer to the implications for the legal status, the maximum
      they can achieve is [4 marks].

5.   N.B. Throughout the questions under “Setting up a new business in Albania”, if a
     candidate inadvertently reverses the names of the two characters, Gent and Agon, do
     not penalize candidates.

     (a)   Describe one form of non-financial reward that Gent could use to motivate the
           teachers in the evening school.                                               [2 marks]

           Gent could use the following forms of non-financial reward:
           • Job enrichment – giving employees a “richer” job experience through more variety
             of tasks and some tasks of greater responsibility and/or complexity.
           • Job enlargement – giving employees a “larger” job experience through more tasks,
             usually of the same level of complexity and responsibility.
           • Empowerment – giving employees more information related to, responsibility for,
             and autonomy over their jobs.
           • Team work – having work performed in teams or groups with the expectation that
             the group performance is more important than individual accomplishment. Many
             workers and in many cultures, the experience of teamwork is deeply rewarding
             and motivating.
           • Praise and recognition – praising employees and giving them recognition, such as
             mentioning their good work at a faculty meeting or naming them “teacher of the
             month” can boost employees self-esteem and give them something to work for.
           • Purpose – working for a good cause, such as Gent’s school, can be
             motivating. Employers can build on this by reminding employees of the good
             service that they are providing, the social good that is coming out of their
             efforts. Reminding people of the higher purpose can be very motivating.
           • Training – providing training often motivates employees, even if the training has
             no immediate economic or cash value. Many people like to learn, feel that
             training, in the long-run, keeps them viable in the workforce, and provides a break
             from routine.

           An example of a description, using job enrichment, would be something like: A work
           colleague could have his job enriched if Gent asked him, in addition to teaching his
           subject (for example, business), to oversee some other aspects of the evening school,
           for example, marketing (advertising the school), recruitment (choosing the students)
           or liaising with the bank or the local authorities (for fundraising).


           Candidates are not expected to word their description exactly as above.

           N.B. Do not accept any reward that has short-term or concrete financial value, such as
           subsidized canteen, holidays, health benefits, car, etc.


           Award [1 mark] for a basic answer that conveys partial knowledge and understanding
           (this could be a theoretical definition of the chosen form of
           non-financial reward).

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear description that conveys knowledge and
           understanding (explicitly mentioning what the chosen form of non-financial reward
           means in the context of Gent’s evening school).
                                           – 23 –           M14/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain one benefit for Agon’s business if Albania joins a regional trading
      bloc such as the European Union (EU).                                       [2 marks]

      Joining a regional trading bloc such as the European Union (EU) means that
      commerce would be easier. This would particularly benefit Albanian businesses
      involved in exports (towards other EU countries such as Italy) and imports (from
      other EU countries such as Germany); Agon’s business (importing electrical
      appliances from Germany) is in that latter category: if Albania joins the EU,
      his business may be able to operate faster, with less paperwork and less border
      control, and cheaper, with fewer import taxes.


      Candidates are not expected to word their answer exactly as above.

      N.B. If a candidate writes about Gent’s business instead of Agon’s business
      (regardless of the name that they use), award [1 mark] if the candidate
      demonstrates some understanding of how joining a regional trading bloc can help
      a country’s businesses. No mark would be awarded for the application, as the
      candidate is talking about the wrong business.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic answer that conveys partial knowledge and
      understanding of the topic of regional trading blocs in general.

      Award [2 marks] for a full, clear explanation that conveys knowledge and
      understanding of a benefit for a business importing goods applied to Agon’s
      business.
                                            – 24 –            M14/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   With reference to Gent’s evening school, contrast two reasons for setting up
      a business.                                                                  [4 marks]

      Reasons for setting up a business include:
      • passion about an idea, an area of interest or a cause; the aim is not primarily to
        make a profit; this is the case of Gent and his evening school, or of social
        enterprises such as The Big Issue in England (social enterprises)
      • having identified a business opportunity or a gap in the market; this seems to
        be the case of Agon; this is the case of most commercial ventures (for example,
        Stelios Haji-Ioannou when he created Easyjet)
      • family tradition: being entrepreneurial is sometimes seen as a family trait;
        many entrepreneurs have had parents and even grandparents who too ran their
        own business
      • redundancy: someone lost their job and, rather than struggling to find another
        employer, they decided to be self-employed.

      N.B. If a candidate talks about Agon’s business but not Gent’s, follow the
      markscheme, which indicates that one of the reasons must talk about Gent’s
      school.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      The two reasons need to be different (see command term “contrast”); if the
      reasons are similar, the maximum a candidate may achieve here is [2 marks].
      One reason must include a reference to Gent’s evening school. If neither reason
      mentions Gent’s school, award a maximum of [2 marks].

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct reason for setting up a business
      identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation in context up to a
      maximum of [2 marks].

(d)   Analyse the main problems that a business start-up may face in a less
      economically developed country such as Albania.                       [5 marks]

      A business start-up in a less economically developed country such as Albania may
      face several problems, such as:
      • poor infrastructure might create challenges, for example, the stimulus mentions
         that access to electricity can be sometimes unreliable in the countryside;
         likewise, transport and logistics can sometimes be difficult; on the other hand,
         workforce is sometimes cheaper and more flexible than in developed countries,
         so it might be easier for new businesses in some areas
      • there might be domestic problems with security, safety, stability; on the other
         hand, the government may be keen to change that negative image and may be
         implementing policies to support economic development through new
         businesses
      • access to initial funding may be more difficult than in developed countries,
         where banks abound; interest rates might also be quite high (though on the
         other hand, some organizations such as Kiva have micro-credit lending
         schemes for a business start-up specifically located in less economically
         developed countries).

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      The balance required for higher marks means that the answer must include
      counter arguments to relativize the problems.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                             – 26 –            M14/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Discuss Gent’s proposed sources of finance for the evening school.                      [7 marks]

      Gent’s proposed sources of finance are indicated in the table: they rely heavily on
      external funding from international NGOs (40 %) and from local authorities
      (40 %) – and to a much lesser extent on fees paid by students themselves (10 %)
      and a bank loan (10 %). Gent is aware that a bank is unlikely to loan much money
      to a business which is not a commercial venture aimed at making profit (ie a
      “social enterprise”), and that the students themselves are unlikely to be able to pay
      much more for the classes (“one of Europe’s poorest countries” according to the
      stimulus).

      This has advantages and disadvantages, for example it is beneficial to have several
      sources of funding (for instance for match-funding purposes or to avoid depending
      upon one sole funder), but it also means that Gent’s school depends largely upon
      international agencies (the NGOs) whose priorities might change in the future.
      These sources of finance are appropriate to a certain extent, though other sources
      could be considered as well, for example, a rich donor or philanthropist,
      or sponsorship.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated discussion.
