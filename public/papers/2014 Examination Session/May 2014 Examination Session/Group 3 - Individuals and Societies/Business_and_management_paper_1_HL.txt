                                                SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    Martin Kimathi faced three major problems.   Firstly, he had employee negotiations about the
      strike.  Secondly, there was the issue with Susan Chapman.  Thirdly, Martin would soon have his
      annual meeting with GP to discuss the strategic direction of The Imperial and to set target profits
      for the coming year.  Because GP had rejected the idea of making a major investment in the hotel
      (Option 1), the discussions would focus on Option 2 (targeting The Imperial at business travellers
      staying for at least one week) and Option 3 (forming a strategic alliance with KenSafar).

      During negotiations with the employee representatives, Martin discovered that they wanted Susan
      to be dismissed.   Otherwise the entire staff would go on strike in December, which would put
      The Imperial’s profits for the year below target.  However, Susan had threatened to take legal action,
      if dismissed.  She said she would claim that she was a victim of discrimination.

      Option 2 appeared to be the best and Martin wanted to go even further.   He had discovered that
      outsourcing the housekeeping staff would be even cheaper than the initial idea of a 70 % reduction
      in housekeeping staff (Item 1).  His original decision tree (Item 2), when modified to take this lower
      cost into account, would make Option 2 even better.  This could also avoid the problem with Susan:
      he could say in court that he was making all housekeeping staff redundant, including Susan, as part
      of a total business reorganization.

      Laying-off all the housekeeping staff worried Martin.   Unemployment is high in Kenya, and he
      feared they might not find new jobs.   Intuitively he favoured Option 3 which would build on
      The Imperial’s history while linking it to the fastest growing areas of Kenyan tourism.


      (a)   Define the term outsourcing.                                                           [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Using information from Item 1, calculate the target profit that would result
                   from an 80 % occupancy rate with housekeeping outsourced.                       [3 marks]

            (ii)   Calculate the expected outcomes of Option 2 and Option 3, using the
                   decision tree in Item 2.                                                        [2 marks]

            (iii) Comment on the expected outcomes calculated in part (ii).                        [2 marks]

      (c)   With reference to Martin Kimathi and The Imperial, compare and contrast
            scientific and intuitive decision-making processes.                                    [9 marks]

      (d)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 5, evaluate the need
            for The Imperial to change objectives in response to changes in the internal and
            external environment.                                                                 [12 marks]

Re:         Outsourcing the Housekeeping Department

After receiving bids from several cleaning service companies, I am pleased to report that we can reduce
the costs of housekeeping by $150 000 per year by outsourcing this department; this does not include
one-time costs related to making all housekeeping positions redundant.   This would lower our
break-even number of customers as shown below, which assumes single occupancy of each apartment
and 150 apartments (all numbers in the table have been rounded to the nearest figure):

From:       GP
Re:         Target profits for upcoming year

Due to the global economic crisis, the directors of GP have decided that specific properties including
The Imperial hotel will have to reach higher target profits than initially planned. The aim is to compensate
for poor returns in other investments.
