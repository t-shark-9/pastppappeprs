Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

1.   Analysis of external examination grades by an international school

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of a CSV file.                                      [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • comma separated values
                  • a text file
                  • a file without formatting where data in a record is separated by commas
                  • a file that represents data in tabular form. Rows are represented by new
                    lines and cells are separated by commas.

                  Note: do not accept firewall or anti-virus software.
                  Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Identify two reasons why the Oneto7 examination board would provide
                  files in CSV format.                                                [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • a file format that is compatible with different spreadsheets and database
                    formats
                  • a CSV file carries no formatting, only text, therefore the file size depends
                    only on the quantity of data it contains, ie the CSV file will be smaller
                    than a formatted file from any application
                  • CSV files are text files and can be opened with many applications,
                    therefore can even transfer manually if needed.

                  Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (iii) Identify two characteristics of a “secure site”.                                  [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • accessed using HTTPS – Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
                  • information sent to and from those sites cannot be accessed by anyone
                    else (i.e. user needs to enter authentication information such as username
                    and password in order to access the site)
                  • Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) provides encryption – preventing
                    information from being read in transit
                  • Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) provides authentication (verifying that the
                    site is who they claim to be).
                  • Secure sites display a padlock/lock symbol
                  • Secure sites use trusted certificates to check for authencity


                  Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Oneto7, an examination board that serves 5000 schools, has been
      contacted by a new company, schoolscompare.com.            This company,
      schoolscompare.com, wishes to buy the data about students’ results from the
      Oneto7 examination board.

      Schools, parents and others can pay schoolscompare.com for a more detailed
      analysis of the examination results. This analysis will be provided using data
      bought from Oneto7, as well as other data they have acquired.

      Discuss the implications of the Oneto7 examination board selling the data it
      holds about the schools to schoolscompare.com.                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • Oneto7 examination board would have to ask schools to authorize the sharing
        of their data
      • Oneto7 examination board would have to wait for parents in the schools to
        authorize the sharing of their son’s/daughter’s data
      • Oneto7 would have the possibility of comparing its results with those of other
        boards
      • other boards would have access to Oneto7’s results
      • a more in-depth analysis may be provided to the schools and parents
      • parents would be able to compare their children’s results with others from the
        same and other schools / boards
      • schools may be assessed by prospective parents from these results
      • universities and other institutions may use this information to evaluate their
        prospective candidates
      • policies of privacy and correct use of information would have to be put in place
      • security issues to guarantee the reliability and integrity of the data must be
        evaluated
      • Oneto7 must investigate that schoolscompare.com has adequate security
        measures
      • agreement needed that Oneto7will not use the data for any purposes other than
        analysis (eg distributing tutoring information to schools that did not perform
        well).

      Note: do not accept generic references to hacking or unauthorized access.
      References must be explicitly related to the scenario.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   Hospital Network

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of a WAN.                                        [2 marks]

                  • a computer network that covers a relatively large geographical area (i.e.
                    wide area network)
                  • a WAN may join two or more LANs
                  • a network of computers that use the telecommunications network to
                    connect between them.

                  Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Identify two ways data about a patient could be entered into the
                  wireless tablets.                                                [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • sensor directly connected to the tablet
                  • voice input – nurse reads out the data
                  • nurse/user types data
                  • nurse/user selects from options on a touch screen
                  • handwritten input using a stylus and converted to text with handwriting
                    recognition software.

           (iii) Describe the purpose of switches in the network.                               [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • switches allow the joining of multiple computers together in a network
                  • a network component that filters and forwards packets between LAN
                    segments
                  • network can grow as switches can be connected to each other to add a
                    progressively larger number of devices to a LAN
                  • allow network services to be provided to devices that are otherwise not
                    on the network
                  • manage data flow on a network by only sending a received message to
                    the device for which the message was intended
                  • increase network security.

(b)   Explain three problems that could result from linking 25 hospitals in the city
      through a WAN.                                                                 [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • compatibility between the systems in the different hospitals / hospitals may run
        different platforms of hardware and software, and databases may need to be
        configured for all or may not run at all
      • privacy issues of information being available across hospitals / patients may
        not trust how some of these hospitals deal with their private information about
        certain illnesses or conditions
      • data collection of information to be shared should be standardized between
        hospitals / if each hospital enters data in its own way then it will be very
        difficult for others to understand it and use it – similar codes for different
        procedures, illnesses and patients must be agreed
      • sharing of costs to implement the connectivity between the hospitals / the
        implementing of a WAN to connect all hospitals may need a greater
        infrastructure, equipment, IT team, training and this will involve costs
      • appropriate bandwidth to effectively share important information / x-rays and
        images or voice consultations may require large bandwidth for doctors in
        different hospitals to have access to all information needed about a patient.
        One of the hospitals may not have this and patients may be at a disadvantage
      • ensuring that the data is kept secure from accidental tampering / how will they
        prevent the accidental change of data by people in different hospitals who may
        now have access to the data
      • providing different levels of access consistently across the different hospitals /
        agreeing on who will have access to what and who will be allowed to add
        information to patients’ data to update records
      • security of data. During transmission, data may pass through servers that are
        outside of the control of the hospital. There is the potential for interception of
        data, packet sniffing or other means of unauthorized access. The network could
        be infected by viruses or other malware.
      • in the case of problems in using the WAN (i.e. WAN failure / server failure,
        too much traffic on the network causing slowness), the hospitals who
        previously had their own database/LAN are now impacted.

      Award [1 mark] for each problem identified up to a maximum of [3 marks].
      Award an additional [1 mark] for each problem explained up to an additional
      maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Discuss the implications for the staff of the introduction of the RFID-based
      tracking system in the hospital.                                             [8 marks]

      Marking note: Candidates do not need to explicitly refer to the implications for
      equipment and patients; however, they may do this implicitly when they discuss
      the implications for staff.

      Answers may include:
      • staff will need to to retrieve the information collected from the RFID tags/ use
        of RFID tag readers – this may involve training.
      • staff will need alternative methods for tracking if the RFID tracking system
        goes down.

      RFID to tag equipment
      • staff may use it to track equipment that they need / equipment that is shared by
        several doctors / nurses may be tracked if needed for another patient
      • staff in charge of a set of equipment may be able to know where it is for their
        use and storage
      • will prevent theft of equipment.

      RFID to tag staff
      • staff may be found if needed in an emergency
      • staff’s whereabouts may be monitored during working hours (e.g. privacy
        issued related to tracking, analysis of how much time staff spend in various
        areas while working, taking breaks or other activities). This may have
        implications for work contracts to maximize time efficiency.
      • staff access to restricted areas may be identified
      • analysis could be carried out on the data collected from the movement of staff
        in the hospital to optimize the location of areas that are used most frequently
        (e.g. if staff are walking frequently to a particular storage area, that storage area
        can be re-located in convenient more accessible location to reduce staff time
        and fatigue).
      • measures will have to be put in place so that the RFID tag for staff cannot be
        used by another staff member. .

      RFID to tag patients
      • staff will be able to know the whereabouts of patients who are able to leave
        their room without having to notify staff in advance
      • staff may not need to stay with patients who have to undergo procedures in
        other areas of the hospital – this may allow nurses to return to the wards until
        patient needs to return to their room
      • warn staff of dangerous or risky situations – some patients may have
        permission to move around certain areas and staff will be warned if they leave
        permitted areas
      • provide staff with correct patient identification – patients in coma or asleep can
        be identified with the appropriate reader and the correct actions / medications
        can be provided – will allow for faster treatment and fewer errors
      • provide staff with patient information – the RFID chip may contain medical
        data such as allergies for surgical patients – will allow fast access to data
        without having to read files or access database.

Note: Do not accept implications related to emission of radiation from RFID tags,
training of staff in using the actual RFID tags or missing RFID tags.

3.   Online training

     (a)   (i)    Calculate the length of time it took to download the 720 MB video.            [2 marks]

                  • using 1024 KB per MB:
                    - 720 MB is 720 x 1024KB = 737 280 KB
                    - bandwidth of 800 Kb/sec = 100KB/sec (KB is kilobyte, Kb is kilobit)
                    - 737280 ÷ 100 = 7372.8 seconds = 123 minutes = 2 hours 3 minutes

                  • accept the approximate of 1000 kb per mb:
                    - 720 x 1000 = 720 000KB (KB is kilobyte, Kb is kilobit)
                    - bandwidth of 800 Kb/sec = 100KB/sec
                    - 720 000 ÷ 100 = 7200 seconds or 120 minutes or 2 hours.

                  Note: Accept 123 minutes = 2.048 hours = 2 hours and 3 minutes or
                  approximately 2 hours.

                  Award [1 mark] for the correct calculation of file size into KB ( 720 MB is

                  indication of units in the calculation. Award one mark for 737280 or 720
                  000.)

                  Award [1 mark] for the correct calculation into time.

           (ii)   Outline the difference between lossless and lossy compression.                [2 marks]

                  Difference in the reconstruction of original data
                  • lossless data compression uses algorithms that allow the exact original
                     data to be reconstructed from the compressed data
                  • lossy data compression does not allow the exact original data to be
                     reconstructed from the compressed data as some data is removed during
                     the compression

             Difference in the loss of data
                 • in lossless data compression no information is lost, it is only changed so
                    that the file size is reduced.
                 • in lossy data compression some information is taken from the file that
                    will change the final image or sound and will make the file smaller.

             Difference in loss in quality
                 • in lossless data compression no information is lost and therefore no loss
                    in quality.
                 • in lossy data compression some information is taken from the file that
                    will result in some loss in quality which normally goes unnoticed.

             Difference in the types of file that are compressed
                 • in lossless data compression is used to compress text and data files.
                 • in lossy data compression is used to compress audio, video and image
                    files.

(iii) Outline the difference between downloading and streaming videos.               [2 marks]

     Answers may include:
     • streaming is when video content is sent in compressed form over the
       internet and displayed on the receiving device in real time . A
       downloaded video is played from a local storage device.
     • when streaming a video the user does not have to wait to download the
       video to play it / watch it A downloaded video must be stored in order to
       view it.
     • streaming a video involves playing the video on one device while the
       media is displayed on another. The video is not moved or copied to the
       device that is playing it Downloaded video is played directly from local
       media or storage device where it is stored.
     • a fast internet connection is needed to stream high definition videos from
       the internet without interruption. When downloading videos, a fast
       internet connection is not required.
     • when streaming video the user needs a player, which is a special program
       that uncompresses and sends video data to the display and audio data to
       the speakers Downloaded videos are played with a media player that is
       installed as a part of most operating systems.
     • a streaming video is not saved on your device. Once you stop playing,
       the media is no longer available A downloaded video is stored on local
       media or storage device (i.e. downloaded videos can be moved to
       different devices (by copying them, video is available whenever you
       want to play it, must wait until the download is complete before you can
       watch the media)

      Answers may include:
      Mining personnel
      • can use the videos several times and go through the steps of the training that
        may have not been clear
      • no need to travel to La Paz to watch the videos means that time will be saved
        because the videos can be watched at the mining site
      • staff will not be able to receive recognition after having done the training
      • will not be able to interact with the interactive parts of the video
      • may not be using the most up-to-date version of the videos.

      Fernando
      • will have to take a manual record of those who completed the training and of
        their performance
      • may lose credibility as he cannot guarantee that the training company will issue
        certificates for those who do the training
      • may make several copies of the videos and share them with many employees
        who might need to go over the training
      • needs to check if the training company allows the videos to be downloaded and
        used offline
      • if training videos were not available onsite, the employees would need to be
        sent to La Paz from the mining site to be trained.
      • by downloading the videos, Fernando’s company may avoid additional costs
        from the local ISP when trying to access the videos from the mining site in the
        Andes.
      • the downloaded videos offer the miners more training opportunities (such as
        view the videos as a group and group discussion of the various aspects of the
        video).
      • due to poor internet access in the Andes, downloading the videos will ensure
        that the trainees will have uninterrupted access to the videos.

      Training company
      • may lose track of its videos if several copies are made and given out to many
        people
      • downloading the videos may violate copyright policy(such as download policy
        may only allow the use of one copy of the training videos, employees may
        share the videos with other miners who are not in the company).

                  information on the electronic identity card.                           [2 marks]

                  Answers may include either ID number, fingerprint recognition or facial recognition:
                  • the card contains an ID number that is unique for each card owner
                  • the database database contains records of the citizens with a key field
                    with the citizen’s ID number
                  • the database can be searched to find the record that contains the ID
                    number input/read from the card.

                  Fingerprint recogition
                  • the card contains a fingerprint of the card owner
                  • the database contains records of the citizens with a key field with the
                   citizen’s fingerprint ( or fingerprint identification descriptors)
                  • an algorithm is used to determine which record contains the fingerprint
                      (fingerprint identification defintion) in the database that matches the
                      fingerprint on the identity card.

                  Facial recognition from photograph
                  • the card contains a photograph of the card holder
                  • the database with the records of the citizens has a key field with the
                      citizen’s photograph
                  • an algorithm is used to determine which record contains the photograph
                  in the database that matches the photograph on the identity card.

                  Answers may include:
                  • at enrolment a photograph was taken, facial features were identified by
                    software and stored in the database
                  • photograph is read/scanned / read from the card of the person to be
                    identified
                  • facial features are identified by software from the photograph
                  • biometric software compares facial features on the photograph with the
                    facial features (“faceprint”) stored in a database
                  • if there is a match, then the record of the person is found/displayed
                  • if the biometric system determines no match, then person needs to use a
                    second method for identification.

           Note: do not accept as a step that “the person is identified”. This is stated in the
           question.

(b) In the future, financial, health, and other government departments and private
institutions will be able to use the information gathered as part of the national identity
card system.

           Many citizens are concerned about the privacy, anonymity and security of
           their data.

           For each of the concerns above, explain a policy that could be used to ensure
           that the concerns of the citizens are addressed.                              [6 marks]

           Answers may include the following stated policies with reason(s)::
           Privacy
           • citizens are informed to specify how the data may be used. For example,
             whether it may be shared with third parties
           • only authorized personnel will have access to the national identity card
             database.

           Anonymity
           • enabling the data associated with the citizen to be detached from their personal
             details such as using only the citizen’s ID instead of the citizen’s personal
             details when sharing or querying data
           • reports made by the government will not allow individuals to be identified.

           Security
           • ensuring the data provided by the citizen is secure (for example, firewall,
             password access, secure servers)
           • measures may be taken to restrict access to the data (such as levels of password
             access)
           • data is encrypted during its transmission.

           Note: the response requires an explanation of a policy and not a discussion of the
           problems themselves. There must be a policy for each kind of concern: privacy,
           anonymity and security and reason(s).


           Award [1 mark] for each policy identified up to a maximum of [3 marks]..
           Award [1 mark] for an explanation of the policy or how the policy will ensure that
           the concerns of the citizens are addressed up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   The implementation of this system has been delayed and the government is
      now reconsidering whether to implement the system.

      Discuss whether the Indonesian government should continue with the
      implementation of the national identity card scheme.               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • sheer size of the national ID card system may be prohibitive
      • will the infrastructure be able to cope with the gathering, storage and security
        of the data?
      • government needs to evaluate how important it is for them to have updated
        information on their citizens, by looking at the quality of the information they
        now have available on all citizens, including criminals, terrorists, immigrants
      • government needs to see if they will be able to retrieve the information
        required in a sensible period of time – for this they would need to implement
        offices all over the country, in the different islands, for people to be able to
        provide the data
      • cost and possible training of people for the data collection need to be
        considered
      • costs and use of hardware – networks may need to be installed in order to allow
        for the data collected to be kept in a centralized database; systems must be kept
        running constantly.
      • campaigns to inform citizens to avoid the feeling of invasion of privacy
      • policies will need to be discussed to clarify the use of the data being collected
      • appropriate storage devices capable of handling the large amount of data that
        will be collected will be needed
      • cost and availability of equipment – cameras, scanners, computers
      • make a plan for implementation (for example, implement area-by-area,
        implement pilot areas before going nationwide
      • government needs to consider how the security of the national identity card
        database can be maintained..

                 Answers may include:
                 • large amount of hardware (computers/servers/routers/switches) need
                   energy to function
                 • processing requiring large amounts of energy (such as large volume of
                   CPU activity, inefficient processors)
                 • redundant or backup power supplies
                 • air conditioning is needed to cool equipment
                 • need for the data center to work 24/7 (i.e. run all of the equipment)
                 • fire control systems
                 • cabling with high energy consumption (i.e. some types of cabling require
                   more energy than optic fiber cable, energy consumption can vary
                   between types of optic fiber cable).

           (iii) Identify two ways that data redundancy may occur in data centres.                [2 marks]

                 Answers may include:
                 • local backups (kept for security in case of device failure)
                 • data centres are backed up in different locations (to allow a different data
                   centre to pick up in case the previous one fails)
                 • data centres (that store information from social networks) may have files
                   saved by several users repeatedly.

(b)   Some governments have decided that data centres will be charged for their
      environmental impact. This may be done by monitoring the volume of data
      stored and the energy consumed to maintain the data centre.

      Analyse this decision.                                                               [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • monitoring by government may be an invasion of privacy and may cause
        clients to find a data centre in a country where these regulations do not exist
      • some data centres will put more emphasis on the purchase of energy efficient
        equipment even if these are more expensive
      • some data centres will opt to downsize their facilities causing slower access or
        lack of backup services causing discontent among clients
      • data centers may investigate ways to reduce redundant data stored on their
        servers
      • data centers may increase the amount that they charge their clients for data
        storage.
      • large data centres with high incomes may support economically projects for
        more efficient energy generators (eg Facebook funding the changes from coal
        to solar panels of the energy-producing companies)
      • in order to implement this decision the government will have to monitor the
        data centers. This has implications for cost, personnel and infrastructure.

      Note: accept responses that address the impacts of the decision as well as those
      that relate to the decision itself.

(c)   ORM, a large company, is expanding and the managers are concerned that
      their IT systems will need an expensive upgrade to be able to manage the
      increasing amount of data held by the company. The company is considering
      moving all of its data to an external data centre and relying on their services
      to store and provide access to this data.

      Discuss whether ORM should move all of its data to a data centre.                      [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • costs – they will have to compare the cost of upgrading their local servers and
        IT facilities with the cost of paying for the services of the external data centre
        provider
      • complexity of the change – they will have to take into account the complexity
        of the change from their local in-house providers of IT services to the move of
        data to the external data centre (time required, changeover period, reliability of
        the files when moved to a different location – may be too large and time to
        upload will make them unavailable)
      • personnel – many of the ORM IT personnel may not be needed and will be
        made redundant – social implications
      • policies – they will have to carefully review the policies at the external data
        centre to understand their responsibilities in the keeping of backups, privacy of
        the information and availability of the services
      • confidential information - ORM will need to determine whether data that
        involves confidential company information should be stored on data centre
        servers. Data can be accessed by personnel at the data center.

      Note: the external data center does not belong to ORM.
      Note: do not consider any references to hacking into the data center servers

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
