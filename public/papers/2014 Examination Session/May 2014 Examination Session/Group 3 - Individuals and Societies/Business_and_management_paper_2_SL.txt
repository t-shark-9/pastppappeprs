                                               SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    LuxEclairage (LE)

      LuxEclairage (LE) was founded by Maurice Dahman, an Electrical Engineer from Algeria.
      He has a degree in electrical engineering and is fluent in French. In 2007, after 12 years working
      for a large lighting business in Luxembourg, Maurice established LE. His business produces
      energy-efficient parts for various indoor and outdoor lighting.

      LE has a unique selling point (USP): the lowest price in the market. Although most sales are in
      Europe, all production is in Algeria, where costs are much lower. As a result, growth in sales revenue
      has been rapid and significant, and LE has gained market share each year.

      Selected financial information for LE (all figures in €m):

                                             2009           2013
       Sales revenue                         28             93
       Cost of goods sold                    11.5            X
       Gross profit                           Y             58
       Net profit before interest and tax     2.8            8.1

       Creditors                               1.8          10.2
       Stock                                   0.94          4.32
       Debtors                                 0.94          3.56

       Total current assets                    5.74         15.52
       Total current liabilities               1.94         11.0

      With the rapid growth in sales revenue since it was first established, LE has experienced some
      diseconomies of scale, especially in the administration of the business. Production occurs in 12 small
      factories located around the city of Algiers, rather than in one large factory. Coordination between
      factories and the administrative offices is, therefore, complicated, and the internet is sometimes
      unavailable. Whereas French is the language used by managers and customers of LE, the workers
      generally speak only basic French and prefer to speak Arabic. In addition, patterns of non-verbal
      communication differ widely between Europe and Algeria.



                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

2.    Klar

      Klar is a factory that bottles mineral water for use in large water dispensers. The factory is located
      on a hill next to a spring from where water flows naturally. Klar uses a flow production method with
      a production capacity of 35 million litres per year. Klar has a 60 % share of the national market and
      also exports bottled mineral water to several countries.

      A multinational company called Kaiser is interested in acquiring Klar. “If the acquisition takes
      place, we will expand Klar’s production to gain economies of scale; we will also add a new range
      of flavoured drinks that will be produced in batches and sold in 1.5 litre bottles. Our maximum
      production capacity of flavoured drinks will be 3 million bottles a year,” says Roman Hitschfeld,
      Kaiser’s Production Manager.

      The forecast costs for producing Klar’s new flavoured drinks are as follows:
      • variable cost per bottle: $0.4
      • estimated sales price per bottle: $1.6
      • fixed costs: $240 000.

      Klar is facing fierce competition from other companies that use plastic bottles and offer lower
      prices to consumers. Although the cost of glass bottles is higher than plastic ones, up until
      now Klar has only used re-useable glass bottles to support its ethical objectives of being
      environmentally-friendly. Now, Klar is considering switching from re-useable glass bottles to non
      re-useable plastic ones. The environmental pressure group Plastic No More! is campaigning against
      the use of plastic. A spokesperson from Plastic No More! said: “there is a growing trend among
      consumers to purchase products that will not damage the environment, but we are still a minority”.


      (a)    (i)   Define the term pressure group.                                               [2 marks]

		(ii)             Describe the production method known as batch production.                     [2 marks]

      (b)    Calculate for Klar’s new flavoured drinks (show all your working):

		(i)              the break-even level of output.                                               [2 marks]

		(ii)             the margin of safety if it operates at full capacity.                         [2 marks]

		(iii) the profit or loss if it operates at full capacity.                                      [2 marks]

      (c)    Construct a fully labelled break-even chart for Klar’s new flavoured drinks.        [5 marks]

      (d)    Analyse one advantage and one disadvantage for Klar of having ethical
             objectives.                                                                         [5 marks]

                                               SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Khumalo Pottery (KP)

      Lungile Khumalo owns a small company called Khumalo Pottery (KP) in Johannesburg,
      South Africa. KP manufactures plates and bowls that are sold to small shops. KP has a unique
      selling point (USP) based upon traditional African designs and patterns decorating the pottery.
      KP does not pay its workers high wages and has never made anyone redundant, even during difficult
      economic times. Lungile always repeated to his workers that beauty was more important than quantity.
      Workers at KP could take time to produce beautiful pottery. They also developed great pride in the
      company and in their work.

      Across the Atlantic, in the United States (US), pottery with African designs was becoming
      increasingly popular. As a result, several large American pottery manufacturers, operating on a very
      large scale, began to mass produce pottery with African-looking patterns. Thanks to their economies
      of scale, these American manufacturers sold their products at a very low price.

      In 2013, one large American company opened a highly automated factory in Johannesburg.
      The aim was to produce and sell African-looking pottery to large retailers across sub-Saharan Africa.
      If successful, the American company would employ up to 150 South Africans. These jobs would
      not require much creativity: the pottery would not be hand-made, but the company would offer good
      wages with fringe payments (benefits).

      The American company used penetration pricing in South Africa, and large retailers eagerly stocked
      their shelves with the pottery. KP’s sales started to decline almost immediately, as the small shops
      selling KP’s pottery were losing customers to the large retailers with lower prices.


      (a)   Identify one advantage and one disadvantage of mass production for the
            American company.                                                                    [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain one difficulty that the American company may face when entering the
            South African market.                                                                [2 marks]

      (c)   Explain two possible purposes of penetration pricing.                                [4 marks]

      (d)   Examine the roles of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation of the workers
            at KP and at the factory opened by the American company.                             [5 marks]

      (e)   Evaluate the impact on South Africa of the American company opening a factory
            in Johannesburg.                                                                     [7 marks]

4.    Magda’s flower business

      Magda Fiori has always loved flowers. When 18 years old, she left school and worked as an
      assistant florist. Then, three years later, she set up her own flower business. She is a sole trader; this
      type of organization is common for florists. She employs two part-time assistants: one who delivers
      flowers to customers in the morning, and one who helps her in the shop at busy times, in the late
      afternoon. Both assistants work four hours a day, six days a week.

      After a difficult start, Magda’s business has been very successful for the last two years. Her customers
      are loyal, even if they cannot always find the flowers they want. Customers like her creativity,
      her sense of humour and the good advice that she gives.

      Magda would now like to expand her business. She could join an international franchise
      such as Interflora. She likes the idea, but she knows that her stock control methods would
      have to change radically. She would need to adopt a “just-in-case” method of stock control,
      which Interflora would require to ensure that customers always find the flowers they want.
      Magda also fears that she cannot afford the necessary investment for storage and marketing.
      She wonders whether a bank will loan her money. Magda’s small business has only one source
      of revenue.

      Magda has also considered three methods of external growth:
      • a joint venture with a local wedding organizer
      • a strategic alliance with a garden centre
      • a merger with another florist.


      (a)   Identify two variable costs for Magda’s flower business.                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain the meaning of the sentence: “Magda’s small business has only one
            source of revenue”.                                                                      [2 marks]

      (c)   Using Magda’s flower business, distinguish between “just-in-case” and
            “just-in-time” methods of stock control.                                                 [4 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for Magda of joining an international
            franchise such as Interflora.                                                            [5 marks]

      (e)   Recommend to Magda one of the three methods of external growth that she
            has considered.                                                                          [7 marks]

5.    Setting up new businesses in Albania

      Gent Spahiu has worked as a teacher for 25 years in Kotë, a small town in Albania. His son Agon has
      just moved to Tirana, the Albanian capital, to set up a small business importing electrical appliances
      from Germany. Albania is one of Europe’s poorest countries and its economic and political
      environment is difficult to conduct business in. Agon is aware of the economic and political challenges.
      Most of the population work in agriculture. Towns suffer from poor infrastructure. In the countryside,
      access to electricity can sometimes be unreliable. In 2009, Albania applied to become a member of
      the European Union (EU). Agon thinks that his business could benefit if Albania joins this regional
      trading bloc.

      As Agon now lives away from home, Gent wants to use the free time that he now has in the evening.
      He wants to give local people the skills and knowledge necessary in a modern society. He imagines
      an evening school for adults, with classes in subjects such as English, basic computer skills and
      business. To pay for the overheads and teachers’ wages, Gent is thinking about the following sources
      of finance for the evening school:

                                                            % of total funding
                                                            required by Gent
       Fees paid by students                                       10 %
       Bank loan (at a very low interest rate)                     10 %
       Funding from international non-governmental                 40 %
       organizations (NGOs)
       Funding from local authorities                              40 %

      Gent has work colleagues who have agreed to teach for very low wages; their main motivation
      is non-financial. Gent’s evening school will follow business principles, especially for quality
      management, but his aim is not primarily to make a profit, it is rather to make improvements to
      society.


      (a)   Describe one form of non-financial reward that Gent could use to motivate the
            teachers in the evening school.                                                        [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain one benefit for Agon’s business if Albania joins a regional trading bloc
            such as the European Union (EU).                                                       [2 marks]

      (c)   With reference to Gent’s evening school, contrast two reasons for setting up
            a business.                                                                            [4 marks]

      (d)   Analyse the main problems that a business start-up may face in a less
            economically developed country such as Albania.                                        [5 marks]

      (e)   Discuss Gent’s proposed sources of finance for the evening school.                     [7 marks]
