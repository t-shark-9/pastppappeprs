SOURCE A                Extract from “The Cold War in the Middle East: Suez Crisis to Camp
                        David Accords” by D Little, in The Cambridge History of the Cold War,
                        Volume 2: Crises and Détente, 2010. D Little is an American professor of History.

Throughout the fall [autumn] of 1973 and into the new year Kissinger solidified his unofficial contacts with
Anwar Sadat, who quickly concluded that the road to resolution of the Egyptian–Israeli conflict ran through
Washington not Moscow. Relying on what came to be known as “shuttle diplomacy”, Kissinger pressed
both Tel Aviv and Cairo, step by reluctant step towards a disengagement agreement in the Sinai and then
raised the possibility of a broader peace settlement. Kissinger’s breakthrough on the Egyptian–Israeli front
was a crucial factor in OPEC’s [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] decision to lift the oil
embargo in the spring of 1974.

Eager to break the deadlock in the Middle East and sustain détente with the Soviet Union, the Carter
administration proposed a peace conference at Geneva, where Washington and Moscow could sit down
with their regional friends to press for a comprehensive settlement. Begin, Israel’s newly elected
Prime Minister, was dead set against the Geneva Conference, because representatives of the PLO [Palestine
Liberation Organization] were likely to be present. Sadat was worried that Carter might strike a deal with
Brezhnev to preserve détente which would jeopardise Egypt’s improved relations with the United States. In
an unexpected move Sadat flew to Jerusalem in November 1977, where he embraced Begin and announced
that Egypt was willing to negotiate a peace treaty with Israel.

SOURCE C              Timeline of events in the Middle East (1973–1977), from The Longman Companion
                      to the Middle East Since 1914 (second edition), by Ritchie Ovendale, 1998.
                      Ritchie Ovendale was professor of International Politics at the University of Wales,

20 October 1973:   Henry Kissinger flies to Moscow and together with Brezhnev drafts a ceasefire
                   agreement, which puts a ceasefire in place and calls for the implementation of UN
                   resolution 242 of 1967 after the ceasefire. It also calls for a just and lasting peace.
                   This is accepted by both sides with 22 October as the day for implementation.

5 November 1973: Kissinger starts shuttle diplomacy between Arab countries and Israel following the
                 conclusion of the October War.

18 January 1974:   First disengagement agreement signed; it allows limited Egyptian troops on the East
                   Bank of the Suez Canal, a no man’s land supervised by the United Nations in the
                   western parts of Sinai, and limited Israeli forces west of the Giddi and Mitla passes.

31 May 1974:       Kissinger manages to convince the Israelis that the Syrian leader Assad is genuine in
                   his assurances that the Golan would not become guerrilla territory. Israel and Syria
                   sign an agreement for separation of forces in the Golan to be supervised and inspected
                   by the United Nations Disengagement and Observer Force.

August 1976:       Kissinger concludes a second disengagement agreement between Israel and Egypt,
                   each side moves their forces further from each other.

SOURCE D                Extract from United Nations Security Council Resolution 340, 25 October 1973.

The Security Council,

1.    Demands that immediate and complete cease-fire be observed and that the parties return to the
      positions occupied by them at 4:50pm on 22 October 1973;

2.    Requests the Secretary-General, as an immediate step, to increase the number of United Nations
      military observers on both sides;

3.    Decides to set up immediately, under its authority, a United Nations Emergency Force to be composed
      of personnel drawn from member states of the United Nations except the permanent members of the
      Security Council and requests the Secretary-General to report on this within 24 hours.


SOURCE E                Extract from a speech by Harold H Saunders, US assistant secretary for Near
                        Eastern Affairs, to the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the US Congress, 1975.

The framework for the negotiations that have taken place and the agreements they have produced involving
Israel, Syria and Egypt have been provided for by UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.

In accepting the framework, all of the parties have accepted that the objective is peace between them based
on mutual recognition, territorial integrity, political independence, the right to live in peace between secure
and recognized borders and the resolution of specific issues which comprise the Arab–Israeli conflict.

We have not devised an American solution, nor would it be appropriate for us to do so. This is the
responsibility of the parties and the purpose of the negotiating process. But we have not closed our
minds to any reasonable solution which can contribute to progress toward our overriding objective in the
Middle East – an Arab–Israeli peace. The step-by-step approach to negotiations which we have pursued has
been based partly on the understanding that issues in the Arab–Israeli conflict take time to mature.
