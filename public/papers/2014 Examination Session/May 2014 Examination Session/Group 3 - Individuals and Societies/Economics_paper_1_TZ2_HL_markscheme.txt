(b)   Evaluate the view that the benefits of economic growth will always
      outweigh the costs.                                                                [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • diagrams to illustrate the costs and benefits
      • an explanation of the potential benefits of growth eg higher living standards
        and on government finances; the potential costs, eg on sustainable
        development and in terms of the possible conflicts with the other goals of
        economic policy such as low inflation or equity in the distribution of income
      • examples of costs/benefits of growth which have occurred
      • synthesis or evaluation.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations.

      Discussion may include: an evaluation of the positive and negative
      consequences of growth.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
