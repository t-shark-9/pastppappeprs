1.   (a)   Using examples, explain the relationship between transport innovation and
           reduced friction of distance.                                                              [10]

           Friction of distance is the barrier to the exchange of goods, services, ideas created by
           slow/limited/expensive transport.        Over time, increased connectivity through
           transport has reduced friction of distance (changing our perception of time/space
           barriers).

           Candidates may explore the relationship through the use of a timeline, and perhaps a
           diagram, showing how transport times have fallen as a result of successive transport
           “revolutions” (bicycle, boat, car train, ’plane, etc). Also credit accompanying
           technologies eg refrigeration for perishables and intermodal transport. Candidates
           may be familiar with the associated geographical concept of time–space convergence
           (in other words, we perceive that we inhabit a “shrinking world” as distant places
           “feel” nearer). Done well, this could be sufficient for the higher mark bands.

           A different approach might be to look at more detailed case studies of particular
           technologies and their application (eg the speed with which flowers from Kenya are
           flown to Europe; or the speed with which containers can bring manufactured goods
           from EPZs in China to the USA). This approach is sufficient for band D even if the
           “relationship” is not particularly clear.

           Finally, the subject guide specifies that candidates should have studied speed and
           capacity changes for two types of transport network. They might draw on this as part
           of their answer. However, they should be careful to focus on the reduced friction of
           distance as the network is modernized, or extended into areas that were previously
           “switched off” (and thus took a longer time to reach).

           Credit may be given for some discussion of the role that telecom networks play in
           transporting data and information, “eradicating” the friction of distance altogether.

           Band C answers are likely to describe some specific details of transport history, but
           with little/no development of “friction of distance” (besides saying it has lessened).

           At band D, expect either a clearer explanation of the changing relationship over time
           (may use the concept of time–space convergence) or effective use of detailed
           examples to explain how transport connects distant places together with reduced
           travel time.

           For band E, expect both.

(b)   “Every country will eventually lose its distinctive national identity as a result of
      global interactions.” Discuss this statement.                                              [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.         Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      The focus should be national (or group) identity although credit can be given for
      groups within a nation eg Amish (USA), Welsh (UK), tribes (Amazon). Discussion
      of a diaspora’s “national” identity (eg the identity of the Chinese in USA) may also
      be credited. Expect candidates to take a range of approaches and to hold a range of
      views about what factors or processes make a place distinctive / less distinctive.

      Possible themes for discussion in agreement with the statement:
       a range of issues can be discussed pertaining to cultural dilution / cultural
        imperialism / immigration / multiculturalism [Guide 5]. Different cultural traits
        may be discussed eg language, diet, music, religion, etc
       evidence may be cited in support of the proposition that increasing cultural
        homogeneity is unavoidable/irreversible, for instance international migration or
        the spread of branded commodities [Guide 5] or the homogenization of
        urban/cultural landscapes [Guide 4]
       sovereign states risk losing political autonomy due to their membership of MGOs
        (especially the case for the EU) or in relation to wealth/leverage of TNCs
        [Guide 6], influence of IMF/World Bank [Guide 3].

      Possible themes for discussion in disagreement with the statement:
       many countries have experienced a resurgence in nationalism/regionalism
        [Guide 6], for instance as evidenced by programmes of nationalization (Bolivia)
        or attempts to limit the dominance of English (in France’s case)
       there are instances of states or societies opting out of globalization/isolationism
        (eg, China’s stance on internet access; North Korea or until recently Myanmar;
        Amish communities in USA) [Guide 7]
       glocalized/hybrid outcomes can still be highly distinctive or unique [Guide 7].

      A more critical, thoughtful or nuanced response might take the view that:
       national identity has many aspects, not all of which are threatened, eg, by MGO
        membership [Guide 6]
       other foci for identity may be becoming more important than national identity for
        many people, eg, diaspora identity.

      At band C, some impacts on national/group identity/culture should be described and
      linked with global interactions such as migration, information flow etc.

      Band D should either provide a wider and more balanced discussion of the statement
      or offer a more critical discussion of what is meant by “distinctive national identity”.

      At band E, expect both.
                                                   –6–              M14/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Using examples, analyse how foreign direct investment and glocalization are
           used by transnational corporations (TNCs) to help their expansion.                          [10]

           Foreign direct investment (FDI) includes a range of different kinds of overseas
           investments made by transnational corporations (TNCs). These include: hiring
           outsourcing services (employing a third party to handle goods or services),
           establishing a “spatial division of labour” (building/buying company-owned branch
           plants or back offices in low-cost locations), mergers, acquisitions and franchises.
           Credit other possible financial outgoings (eg TNCs working alongside charities).
           Good answers should recognize more than one type of FDI, using examples.

           Glocalization describes the adapting of a “universal” product to meet the cultural
           requirements of local markets (religion, taste, legal requirements may all vary from
           territory to territory). Glocalization is also linked to local sourcing strategies (using
           local suppliers), which may have political dimensions too (TNCs may be required to
           work with local partners eg in India).

           Candidates could comment on how geographic expansion is achieved through use of
           these strategies. TNCs achieve greater profits/market share through their geographic
           strategies, and can win local acceptance by embracing local people’s culture.

           Candidates may additionally analyse how different strategies suit different TNCs (oil
           companies may not glocalize to the extent retailers do), or may analyse the
           weaknesses and not just the strengths of strategies.

           Band C answers may describe examples of glocalization and/or FDI but with a lack
           of terminology and little mention of expansion (beyond asserting that it happens).

           At band D, expect either a more detailed, exemplified explanation of both strategies
           (but do not expect balance) or some explicit analysis of how market expansion is
           achieved by particular TNCs.

           For band E, expect both.
                                            –7–             M14/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Examine the relationship between a country’s gross national income (GNI) and
      its level of participation in globalization.                                            [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.       Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Candidates will have studied global participation with reference to the Kearney or
      KOF globalization indices, which recognize economic, social and political strands of
      globalization. Therefore, accept a wide interpretation of what is meant by
      “participation” in globalization.

      Possible themes suggesting a positive relationship between GNI and participation:
       well-known indexes (eg, KOF index) show high globalization scores for countries
        with a high GNI, as a rule [Guide 1]
       foreign direct investment by TNCs can bring many financial benefits that lead in
        turn to greater global economic participation for businesses and citizens
        (if incomes grow, allowing people to consume more globally-produced services or
        participate in tourism) [Guide 3]
       levels of sociocultural participation (an aspect of KOF) may also be higher for
        high-income countries [Guide 5]
       the role of remittances can be explored, as flows often take place between richer
        and poorer countries [Guide 3]
       poorer societies remain “non-globalized” eg, Amazonian tribes [Guide 7]
       poorer nations only experience one-way interactions – their assets are stripped by
        powerful nations/TNCs (raw materials, landgrabs) [Guide 4].

      A more critical, thoughtful or nuanced response might take the view that:
       there are many types of global participation/interactions. People may participate
        in economic globalization but not necessarily cultural globalization (eg, Chinese
        factory workers with limited internet freedoms) [Guide 1]
       scale/disparities may be important. Some nations with higher GNI are
        “two-speed” societies: elite groups participate globally, not poorer groups
        [Guide 1]
       the relationship could be complex in the case of a migratory “brain drain” –
        remittances may boost GNI, but out-migration could reduce GNI too [Guide 3]
       the role of other aid/loans can be discussed – low GNI nations may be major
        beneficiaries of certain types of global financial flow [Guide 3]
       there are other possible exceptions / anomalies to the rule that can help lift a
        response into bands D/E.

      At band C, some links between GNI/wealth and globalization should be described.

      Band D should either provide a wider, detailed explanation of different links between
      GNI and participation or offer a more critical examination of what is meant by a
      country’s “participation in globalization”.

      At band E, expect both.
                                                 –8–              M14/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Explain why it might be hard to observe and measure some types of global
           interaction.                                                                             [10]

           The focus should be the challenge of collecting the data, rather than querying
           whether it should be included/used as a legitimate measure of global
           interactions/globalization. Many candidates, even at the band C/D border, may
           provide a general critique of the KOF/Kearney index, much of which is of marginal
           relevance to this particular question. These will need reading carefully for
           references to the difficulties in collecting/measuring/observing global interactions.

           Expect candidates to show some familiarity with the Kearney and/or the KOF multi
           strand indexes of globalization. These compartmentalize globalization in terms of
           personal, economic, political aspects, etc. Some may correctly answer this question
           by focusing on those strands of Kearney/KOF that are hard / subjective to observe, or
           monitor – for instance, KOF’s “cultural proximity” measure.

           The focus should be on explaining why it is hard observe some movements (such as
           the diffusion of cultural traits) and/or measuring/quantifying them. Possible themes:
            informal remittances from legal and illegal migrants are hidden
            unknown content of private information / data exchange
            criminal/illegal flows (trafficking of people and drugs) are not recorded
            TNCs may hide the movement of profits through tax havens (transfer pricing)
            complexities of tracking economic data / trade figures hence possible inaccuracy
            people may be watching “local” or “global” TV and other media, it is hard to tell.

           Band C answers should describe difficulties associated with the collection of data for
           at least two types of global interaction (eg data flows, migration).

           At band D, expect either a wider, more detailed range of data collection difficulties
           or some explicit analysis of the distinction between observation and measurement.

           For band E, expect both.
                                             –9–              M14/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   “Global interactions have brought only negative impacts to human landscapes
      and physical environments everywhere.” Discuss this statement.                             [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands.         Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Some candidates may discuss “the positive and negative impacts of human activity
      for physical and human geography” (ie a far broader focus than the given title).
      Whilst benefit of doubt should be given where deserved, note that some impacts, are
      not necessarily a product of global interactions (Chernobyl), nor are all impacts of
      farming. Good candidates will stress the global dimensions of the case studies they
      use. Human impacts should relate to the landscape (so impacts such as “poverty
      alleviation” ideally need some link with a landscape change, such as housing
      improvement). Changes in ethnicity/language are perfectly valid as they form part
      of the cultural landscape. Accounts of global warming should be judged on their
      merits.

      Possible themes for discussion in agreement with the statement:
       there has been some homogenization of urban landscapes (uniform appearances,
        common activities, styles of construction, skyscrapers) [Guide 4]
       there are many physical themes that could be addressed, including degradation of
        the rainforest due to global demand eg, for soya, soil degradation (should be
        linked with global agribusiness), climate change (should be linked with
        international consumption of resources), transboundary pollution [Guide 4].

      Possible themes for discussion in disagreement with the statement:
       global/local efforts for the protection of cultural landscapes eg, UNESCO sites or
        the resurgence of nationalism in relation to the protection of the built environment
        [Guide 6, Guide 7]
       global civil society organizations/NGOs have fostered environmental awareness
        [Guide 4].

      A more critical, thoughtful or nuanced response might take the view that:
       not all countries participate in global interactions to the same extent so effects are
        highly variable in any case [Guide 1]
       different perspectives exist on what constitutes “negative” in relation to cultural
        landscapes (though there will be broader agreement on what constitutes a negative
        or positive impact on the physical environment).

      For band C, some impacts to human landscapes and physical environments should be
      described (do not expect balance) and linked with global interactions.

      Band D should either provide a wider, evidenced discussion of both impacts (do not
