                                            SECTION A

Hinduism

1.   “Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this.
     Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying;
     always they will tend toward that state of being. Therefore remember me at all times and
     fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. When you
     make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the
     supreme glory of the Lord.”

                                                                                  Bhagavad Gita 8:5–8


     (a)   Outline the ways in which Krishna suggests that a person can reach union with the
           divine.                                                                                   [3]

           Krishna states that union with the divine being can be achieved by:
           • remembering him at the time of death through one-pointed focus (heart and mind)
           • inclining the heart and mind towards Krishna (the divine) in everyday life
           • regular practice of meditation; jnana marga; study of scriptures
           • devotion (bhakti marga).

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   Deduce the relationship between Krishna’s teachings in the passage and paths to
           moksha (Yoga).                                                                            [7]

           • Union between the self (atman) and the supreme being (brahman) is the definition of Yoga.
           • The remembrance of Krishna at the time of death leads to union (“come to me”).
           • The instruction to remember Krishna at all times (“heart and mind”) refers to Bhakti Yoga.
           • Krishna’s suggestion that remembrance requires daily practice of meditation may refer to
             Yogic practice.
           • His teaching that the mind will only remember what it has been attached to in everyday life
             and his instruction to “fight on” can refer to Karma Yoga.
           • The reference to “meditation” could refer to Jnana Yoga.
           • The possibility of the passage referring to all the paths of Yoga taught in Hinduism and
             thus attempting to reconcile different paths to union with the supreme being.

Buddhism

2.   “No fever [desire] is found
     In one who has travelled the road,
     Who, sorrowless, freed in every way,
     Has destroyed all bonds [reached nirvana/nibbana].”

                                                                                         Dhammapada 90


     (a)   Comment on the meaning of “No fever [desire] is found” within this verse.                 [3]

           • Fever is linked with heat or burning.
           • Within Buddhism burning is linked with desire or craving (tanha).
           • The person who has no fever (no burning) has no desire or craving and has therefore
             reached nirvana/nibbana.

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   Explain why nirvana/nibbana (Enlightenment) is “sorrowless”.                              [7]

           •   The problem with human existence is that it is filled with dukkha (sorrow or pain).
           •   The goal of the Buddhist path is to eradicate dukkha or sorrow.
           •   This is done by eradicating the source of dukkha.
           •   The source of dukkha is craving (or greed, hatred and delusion).
           •   When craving is eradicated, dukkha or sorrow cannot arise.
           •   When craving is eradicated, nirvana/nibbana or Enlightenment is reached.
           •   So nirvana/nibbana or Enlightenment is “sorrowless”.

Sikhism

3.   “For many births you have become a worm or moth, an elephant, a fish or a deer. In several
     births you may have become a bird or a snake or may have been yoked as a horse or an ox.
     Meet the Creator of the universe, now is the time for the meeting: after a long time you have
     been given human form.”

                                                                                Guru Granth Sahib 176


     (a)   Identify what this passage says about the human condition.                                 [3]

           • The soul has been trapped in the cycle of birth and death, even taking countless
             animal lives.
           • It is only after wandering through many lives that human life is attained.
           • Only human life has the possibility of becoming close to God.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   Analyse the relationship between the human condition and the “Creator of
           the universe”.                                                                             [7]

           • The teachings in the passage indicate that Sikhs believe in reincarnation or the cycle
             of samsara.
           • Sikhs believe that human birth is the vehicle for ending samsara.
           • Sikhs consider human birth is only attained by the grace of God.
           • Sikhs believe that in human life the Creator of the universe can be “met” in divine union.
           • The Sikh Gurus taught that union with God can happen in this life rather than after death.
           • Sikhs understand the way to union with God to consist of inner purification of the mind.
           • Purification of the mind can only be achieved by cultivating a God-fearing life as taught by
             the Gurus.

Islam

6.   “The is the Book [al-kitab], in it is guidance, without doubt, to those who are righteous, who
     believe in the Unseen, are steadfast in prayer [salat] and spend of what We have provided for
     them, and who believe in the revelation sent to you and sent before your time, and in their
     hearts have the assurance of the Hereafter.”

                                                                                        Qur’an 2:2–4


     (a)   Outline at least three ways in which Allah provides divine guidance to humankind.       [3]

           • Allah provides guidance to humankind by sending “the Book”, which contains
             commandments and prohibitions. The Book can be identified with the Qu’ran, which is
             the exact copy of the eternal Book preserved in heaven.
           • Divine guidance is also given through the statement of a set of beliefs contained in
             the Book. These are: belief in one God only (monotheism), that is belief in the Unseen,
             meaning a reality which we cannot physically grasp; belief in divine revelation through a
             series of prophets such as Muhammad, Moses, Jesus, etc (“sent to you and sent before
             your time”); and belief in Reward and Punishment/Divine Judgement.
           • Divine guidance is given through the prescription of rituals such as prayer and
             charity/alms-giving which focus the believer’s mind on the unity of Allah (prayer)
             and the unity of His creation (one humanity, each member supporting one another
             through alms-giving).
           • Mention of Sunnah/Hadith.

                                            – 10 –            M14/3/WLDRE/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain why divine requirements such as ritual prayer (salat) and alms-giving
      (zakat) can help Muslims not to stray from the right path.                                   [7]

      All or some of these arguments could be included.
      • Ritual prayer which is to be performed five times a day is a means for a Muslim to
         remember Allah and to mention the name of Allah on a regular basis, in the midst of the
         daily routine of work, study, relaxation, etc. It helps to bring the spiritual dimension into
         the secular dimension, to set aside a few minutes of the day for Allah and not to forget
         what really matters in life.
      • To perform ritual prayer is to show submission to the will of Allah who has prescribed it,
         and therefore to affirm the status of humankind as willing, humble and virtuous creatures
         who praise Allah’s name. To regularly exercise submission leads humans to be virtuous,
         modest, not to follow selfish desires.
      • To perform ritual prayer five times a day gives Muslims a sense of unity and
         brotherhood/sisterhood as, irrespective of social status, profession or gender, every Muslim
         is required to perform the same actions. This improves the shared sense of humanity, as all
         are created by the same Creator, and therefore helps preventing arrogance
         and prevarication.
      • To give to charity (zakat) is another expression of such communality. Zakat is to be
         understood as the redistributing of what was originally granted by Allah to some
         individuals (“spend of what We have provided for them”). Therefore wealth and riches are
         prevented from empowering some individuals at the expense of others. Zakat is also a
         protection against selfish greed.
      • Zakat is also a means to be content with what you have. It keeps the individual focussed
         on his/her good actions and spiritual virtues, not on material possessions.
      • Zakat is a reminder that Allah will judge individuals on their good deeds, not on their
         wealth and status. Real bliss will come in the Hereafter from having fulfilled divine
         commandments in this world.
      • Zakat is for the support of the community of believers (umma).

Taoism

7.   “The sage moves through life not caring about home or name,

     He judges no one. His feet leave no prints.
     He is the perfect person.
     His boat is empty.”

Jainism

8.   “In this wilderness of mundane [worldly] existence, the embodied soul, on account of its
     association with external objects (other than the Self), becomes subject to numerous and
     various kinds of sufferings. Hence, those desirous of attaining spiritual liberation shun such
     contact in thought, word and deed.”

                                                                                         Samayika-patha


     (a)   Identify why Jains believe the “association with external objects” is a problem for
           the soul.                                                                                 [3]

           •   The Soul or Self becomes attached to the enjoyment of material objects.
           •   Such enjoyment leads to attachment.
           •   Attachment leads to suffering as the soul becomes entrapped in the world of matter.
           •   Karma attaches to the soul and holds it down in the material world.

             material objects.
           • The soul becomes attached to the material, and loses its innate bliss.
           • Anger, greed, hatred, envy and lust arise as consequences of attachment.

Baha’i Faith

9.   “Therefore, we learn that the immortality of the soul, or spirit, is not contingent or dependent
     upon the so-called immortality of the body, because the body in the quiescent state, in the time
     of sleep, may be as dead, unconscious, senseless; but the soul, or spirit, is possessed of
     perceptions, sensations, motion and discovery. Even inspiration and revelation are obtained
     by it.”

     ‘Abdu’l-Bahá The Promulgation of Universal Peace, Talk in Washington DC, 9 November 1912


     (a)   Outline the meaning of this passage.                                                       [3]

           • In this passage ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is explaining the difference between the soul and the body.
           • The soul has immortality but the body has only a “so-called” immortality.
           • The soul can receive revelation from God even when the body is asleep.

     (b)   Explain the Baha’i teachings about the soul.                                               [7]

           • Baha’is believe that each child is born pure and holy.
           • God created humans with immortal souls and a dual nature: an animalistic and a selfish
             (evil) side and a spiritual side (soul) with reason to develop their divine attributes and
             pursue God’s plan for humanity.
           • The Baha’i teachings are not clear on whether animals have souls but if they do, then they
             are “animal souls” rather than “human souls”. Only humans have immortal souls.
           • According to Baha’i belief, the soul becomes associated with the body at the point
             of conception.
           • While in this life, it acquires virtues, such as honesty, love, truthfulness, kindness, etc.
             These qualities are needed in the next world.
           • At the point of death, the soul separates from the body. Souls continue to progress
             “throughout the worlds of God”.
           • In Baha’i understanding, life after death is neither cyclical (as in reincarnation theories)
             nor static, as progress is without end.
