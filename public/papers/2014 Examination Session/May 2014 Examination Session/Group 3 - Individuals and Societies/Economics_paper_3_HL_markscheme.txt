Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in calculation,
   but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts,
   then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR on
   the script where you are rewarding this. Please note that OFR is now available as an annotation
   stamp.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4 mark] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be given.


1.   (a)   Calculate the gross domestic product (GDP) for Country Z in 2012.                          [2]

     (b)   The population of country Z is 420 000.          Calculate per capita GDP for
           Country Z in 2012.                                                                         [2]

(c)   Countries may calculate GDP using the output approach, the income
      approach or the expenditure approach. Outline the difference between the
      expenditure approach and the income approach.                                           [2]

           expenditure approach, total spending is calculated”).

           For a clear understanding that in the expenditure approach, total spending
           on domestic output is summed, whereas in the income approach, incomes
           earned in the production of domestic output are summed.

      A response which states accurately the components of each approach should be
      fully rewarded ie
      expenditure approach = C + I + G + ( X − M )
      income approach = wages + profits + interest + rent.

      However, it is not necessary to state these components in order to earn full marks.

(d)   Economists have suggested that it is important to calculate “green GDP”.
      Outline the meaning of the term “green GDP”.                                            [2]

           environment.

           effects of production on the environment.

(e)   In Country Z, for each additional $1 of income earned, 4 cents ($0.04) is
      saved, 15 cents ($0.15) is taken as tax and 6 cents ($0.06) is spent on imported
      goods and services. Calculate the value of the multiplier in Country Z.            [2]

(f)   (i)   The government of Country Z intends to increase government spending
            in order to increase GDP by $950 million. Using your answer to (e),

(ii)   Sketch an AD/AS diagram to show the impact of the multiplier.                     [3]

       Candidates who incorrectly label the diagram, or who do not include an AS
       curve, can be rewarded with a maximum of [2]. Any version of the
       aggregate supply curve is acceptable.

       For the vertical axis, the labelling could be price level, average price level,
       PL, APL, CPI or GPL. For the horizontal axis, the labelling could be real
       GDP, real output, real income, RGDP or Y. A title is not necessary.

            income to another OR that an increase in government spending leads to a
            series of increases in income.

       2    The written response is clear.                                                  3–4
            For a response which explains that spending by one person represents
            income to another. Thus an increase in government spending leads to a
            series of additional increases in income. Therefore the eventual increase in
            GDP will be greater than the initial increase in government spending.

       A response which makes effective use of an algebraic explanation to
       demonstrate the successive increments in national income may be fully
       rewarded.

                          individuals dropping out of the labour market, this could be
                          because they are discouraged from looking for work
                        • underemployment – underestimation as a result of part time
                          workers who would have preferred to be working full time
                        • overestimation as a result of the inclusion in the official

             will be smaller than the loss in consumer surplus because producer surplus
             increases and the government earns tariff revenues. Thus part of the loss in
             consumer surplus is offset by a benefit to other stakeholders ie domestic
             producers and the government.

       1   The written response is limited.                                               1–2
           For any two consequences expressed in a vague manner OR one
           consequence explained clearly.

           A candidate who explains one consequence in a vague manner may be
           awarded [1].

      2    The written response is clear.                                                 3–4
           For any two consequences explained clearly.

           A candidate who explains one consequence clearly and a second
           consequence in a vague manner may be awarded [3].

           Consequences on consumers may include:
           • some consumers will (benefit as they will) now be able to purchase butter
             at a lower price
           • some consumers will (be worse off as they might) be unable to obtain
             butter due to the shortage
           • some consumers (will be worse off as they) might be forced to purchase
             butter at a higher price in the underground/parallel market.

           Any other valid explanation should be rewarded.
