This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                    photons lose energy in reaching observer (so frequency must be reduced);

            (ii)    the planet has a gravitational field;

                    of time;

                 This is a question testing units for this option.        Do not award second

            (iii) isotope Y has a suitable physical and effective half-life / isotope X has too
                  small physical half-life;
                  so the patient receives from Y a more effective dose over a reasonable time;        [2]

23.   (a)   π− / antiparticle of π+ ;                                                              [1]
            Do not award mark if sign is omitted.

      (b)   (i)    (electro) weak;                                                                 [1]

            (ii)   gluon/photon;                                                                   [1]

      (c)   (strangeness is not conserved in interaction B) but this is not necessary for a weak
            interaction;
            strangeness is conserved in interaction C therefore decay is possible;                 [2]
            Allow ECF if B identified as strong/gravitational/electromagnetic in (b)(i).

            0.73 (fm) ;
            (diameter of proton is about 10–15 m)                                                  [2]

      (b)   (quarks are confined) a single quark cannot be observed/exist outside nucleon as
            the interaction strength increases with separation;
            (so the) energy supplied will create a hadron/quark-antiquark pair (such as
             π meson) rather than a free quark;                                                    [2]

25.   (a)   alternate anodes connected to same polarity;                                               [1]

      (b)   (i)    acceleration occurs between anodes;
                   force exerted on protons by the potential difference/electric field between
                   anodes;
                   potential difference/electric field reverses while protons are inside anode
                   (where there is no acceleration);                                                   [3]

            (ii)   protons get faster;
                   alternating potential difference has constant frequency;
                   anode length must increase so that time in anode is constant;                       [3]

                   ( E = 1710 MeV)
                   so kinetic energy of proton must be (1710 − 938 =

                   This is the unit question in the option. Do not award first mark without unit
                   or for incorrect unit.



26.   (a)   (i)    Z (boson) / Z0 / boson;                                                             [1]

            (ii)   Z is massive/has mass;                                                              [1]

      (b)   neutral current interaction (mentioned);
            which is only observed with a weak/electroweak (interaction);
            as predicted by the standard model;                                                    [2 max]

      (c)   constituents of standard model are point objects, extended in string theory;
            spacetime is multi-dimensional, standard model is 3D (time);                               [2]

            energy required for electron-positron pair
            this is more than energy of photon so large-scale pair production unlikely;
