Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 20 marks]. Maximum total = [40 marks].

Markscheme format example:
     Question                                         Answers                                                       Notes                Total

                   OR                                                                                                                      1
                   a condition in which blood supply to some part of the brain is impaired ‹due to
                   a blocked/burst artery› 

1.    Each row in the ‘Question’ column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.    Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’
      column. The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

                                                                                                                                     continued …

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity
      as that in the ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is
      emphasized by OWTTE (or words to that effect).

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first
      marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. ‘ECF acceptable’ will
      be displayed in the ‘Notes’ column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

b   there are some data indicating that athletes involved in strength       No marks awarded for stating that muscles
    training benefit from protein intakes in excess of daily                are made of protein OWTTE
    recommendations/athletes in intense training should consume
    between 1.2/1.3 and 1.7/1.8g kg–1 day–1
    very high protein intakes ‹4 to 5g kg–1 day–1› are common in some
    weightlifting groups ‹for example heavyweight strength/power
    athletes›
    protein intakes ‹in the range of 1.3 and 1.8g kg–1 day–1› consumed as
    three to four meals will maximize muscle protein synthesis
    a dose of protein that appears to maximally stimulate muscle protein
    synthesis for weightlifters appears to be in the range of 20 to 25g
    the optimum timing for protein ingestion to promote the most
    favourable recovery and adaptation is as soon as possible after
    training/microscopic muscle repair                                                                                 4 max

    an economical, practical and efficacious protein beverage for
    athletes to consume after training is milk
    there can be adverse health effects of high-protein intakes for some
    athletes ‹primarily kidney damage›
    high protein intakes can increase urine output substantially and
    combined with sweat losses could lead to dehydration and impair
    performance/health
    consuming sufficient protein to meet even the highest reported
    athlete recommendations ‹~2g kg–1 day–1› is not difficult assuming
    one eats a wide variety of foods
    protein breakdown above the resting level occurs during resistance
    training for weightlifters
