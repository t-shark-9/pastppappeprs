Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.
Around the world three billion people still cook on open indoor fires. Four million people die annually from
the toxic emissions caused by these inefficient, smoky cooking fires. Women and children are particularly
affected, spending hours in the kitchen daily. Alec Drummond and Jonathan Cedar of the US-based
company, BioLite, have designed the BioLite HomestoveTM (Figure 17) to reduce indoor air pollution.
BioLite’s pilot retail programs work with local leaders and sales agents in emerging markets to promote the
product to communities. Revenue from BioLite’s recreational product family, sold in developed countries,
help support the costs required to establish distribution and sales support in these emerging markets. The
BioLite CampStoveTM is the flagship product of the recreational division and its success has enabled long-
term investment in the HomeStove program.

(Figures 18 and 19) Both the HomeStove and CampStove burn wood to produce a fire that can be used for
cooking. The waste heat from the fire is converted into electricity via a thermoelectric generator. This powers
an internal fan that circulates air back into the fire, making it burn more efficiently.  Surplus electricity can
charge a cell phone, LED lights, and other small devices off-grid via a USB port located on the powerpack.
