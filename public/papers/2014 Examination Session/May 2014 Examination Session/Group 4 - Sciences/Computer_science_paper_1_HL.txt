Answer all questions.

11.   A builder is renovating a series of apartments and is considering integrating a few electrical
      devices in each apartment into an automatic programmable system. One example is the
      integration of lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning.

      (a)   Identify two groups of users that might find this integrated technology
            particularly appealing.                                                                      [2]

      (b)   Discuss two advantages, offered by this technology, that could be used in an advertisement
            for the apartments.                                                                          [4]

      (c)   Evaluate two ways users can access the functionality of the integrated system at home.       [6]

      The same technology is adapted and used for intensive chicken farming; in this context a
      decentralized control is preferred.

      (d)   Describe how this could be achieved.                                                         [3]


12.   An international organization has offices located across several countries. For some of
      its activities, for example human resource management, it has been decided to adopt a
      “Software-as-a-Service” (SaaS) solution in order to keep the running costs low.

      (a)   Describe the features of SaaS.                                                               [3]

      (b)   Discuss the limitations of SaaS in relation to security.                                     [6]

      Each office makes some data available to external customers through the use of an extranet
      and allows employees to work from home through a VPN.

      (c)   Define the term extranet.                                                                    [2]

      (d)   Distinguish between a VPN and an extranet.                                                   [4]

13.   The faceplate of a car stereo has six buttons for selecting one of six preferred radio stations.
      As part of the internal representation of a microprocessor there is an array with six positions,
      carrying the information about the radio frequencies, as follows.

                        Radio
                                  [0]      [1]      [2]       [3]      [4]      [5]
                                 100.4    88.7      90.2    104.5     93.8     106.2


      (a)   State the information at Radio[2].                                                             [1]

      (b)   Outline how a numerical frequency could be stored in a fixed-length string.                    [2]

      (c)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode that calculates the range of frequencies
            (ie the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies) of any set of six selected
            radio stations.                                                                                [6]

      The two-dimensional array Stats provides an indication of how often a specific station is
      listened to by the user. For each button in the faceplate it records how often it has been clicked
      in the last 48 hours. Stats is ordered by the second column.

                                        Stats
                                                   5          13
                                                   4          9
                                                   0          8
                                                   3          4
                                                   1          3
                                                   2          2


      Both Radio and Stats are used by a procedure that allows the user to access the radio frequencies
      that are listened to most often, as recorded in Stats, by flicking a lever on the steering wheel.
      The frequencies are accessed cyclically, ie after the least used frequency the procedure returns
      to the most used. For this reason a queue Q is used.

      (d)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode that, by using the structures Radio and Stats,
            performs the following steps:

            • it inserts the radio frequencies in the queue Q, following the actual order of preference;
              and then
            • it uses the queue Q, cyclically, to output an element each time the lever is flicked.        [6]

14.   Consider the following diagram and pseudocode for drawing on a display screen.

                            ENDPOINT

                                               CENTRE


                                                                   2 × SIZE




                                                 SIZE

                                ENDPOINTS = drawH(CENTRE, SIZE)

      The method drawH(CENTRE, SIZE) will draw an “H” located at CENTRE with width of SIZE
      and height of 2 × SIZE, as shown. It returns an array containing the four endpoints of the
      vertical lines.

      In the following flowchart, POINTS1 is a stack.




                   Is
                POINTS1          no        pop CENTRE                  draw H
                 empty?                    from POINTS1                at CENTRE



                      yes



      (a)   Construct pseudocode corresponding to the flowchart.                                    [3]




                                                         (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 14 continued)

      (b)   Construct the drawing that would be produced by the flowchart on page 6 if it is preceded
            by the following steps.

            SIZE = 20
            CENTRE = the middle of the user’s display
            POINTS1 is a stack, initially empty
            ENDPOINTS = drawH(CENTRE, SIZE)
            loop COUNT from 0 to 3
              POINTS1.push(ENDPOINTS[COUNT])
            end loop
            SIZE = SIZE / 2                                                                              [2]

      The pattern of drawing a new set of H’s, which have a SIZE value that is half the SIZE value
      of the previous H, can be repeated. Each set of H’s of the same size is called a generation.

      (c)   Construct an algorithm that will draw an initial H in the centre of the display and three
            generations after that.                                                                      [6]

      (d)   State how many endpoints there will be after the initial H and three generations have been
            drawn, without any consideration of the size.                                                [1]

      (e)   Suggest how drawing this pattern of H’s could be done recursively.                           [3]

15.   A suburban railway system for a large city in Southern Europe consists of two lines L1 and L2,
      which meet at the station Centro, where passengers can change from one line to the other.
      The system is shown below.


              ZONE 4                        ZONE 3                    ZONE 2          ZONE 1                  ZONE 0

      Each station is located in a particular zone, and the total number of zones in which the journey
      takes place determines the train fare. Note, if a passenger starts in Zone 1, goes to Zone 0 and
      then back to Zone 1, the journey has taken place in three zones. Examples of the number of
      zones are shown below for different journeys.

                                  Alora                  Plaza Mayor                      7
                                  Lomas                         Col                       4

      (a)    State the number of zones in which the journey takes place when travelling from Alora
             to Fuengirola.                                                                                                  [1]

      The data for each station (station name, line, zone) is stored on the system’s server in the
      collection TRAIN_DATA. There are 12 stations in total. The first part of the collection is
      shown below.

      Centro,         L1,    0,    Alora,         L1,    3,      Torrox,      L1,    1,       Col,      L2,     1,     ...

      From this we can see that Alora is part of line L1 and is located in Zone 3.

      At the start of each day, the data in TRAIN_DATA is read in to the binary tree TREE, in which
      each node will hold the data for one station. The binary tree will be used to search for a specific
      station’s name.

      (b)    Sketch the binary tree after the station data from the first part of the collection,
             given above, has been added.                                                                                    [3]

                                                                       (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 15 continued)

      The TRAIN_DATA collection is also used to construct the one-dimensional array
      STATIONS (which only contains the list of station names sorted into alphabetical order),
      where STATIONS[0] = Alamo.

      (c)   State the value of STATIONS[4].                                                           [1]

      The two data structures (STATIONS and TREE) are now used to construct the two‑dimensional
      array FARES containing the fares between stations, partly shown below. Note that the fare for
      travelling in each zone is €1.00.

                   FARES       Alamo          Alora     Centro       Col         ...
                   Alamo          0           1.00          4.00     5.00        ...

                    ...          ...           ...          ...      ...       ... etc


      (d)   Calculate the fare for travelling from Torrox to Lima.                                    [1]

      (e)   Construct the algorithm that would calculate the fares for this two-dimensional array.
            You can make use of the following two sub-procedures:

            •   TREE.getZone(STATION) // which returns the zone in which the
                                         // station is located
            •   TREE.getLine(STATION) // which returns the line on which the
                                         // station is located

            Your algorithm should make as few calculations as possible.                               [9]
