Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible.
Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by
written working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      As part of his IB Biology field work, Barry was asked to measure the circumference of trees,
      in centimetres, that were growing at different distances, in metres, from a river bank.  
      His results are summarized in the following table.

        Distance, x (metres)                   5     12      17     21     24     30     34   44     47

      (a)   State whether distance from the river bank is a continuous or discrete variable.              [1]

      (b)   On graph paper, draw a scatter diagram to show Barry’s results.   Use a scale
            of 1 cm to represent 5 m on the x-axis and 1 cm to represent 10 cm on the y-axis.             [4]

      (c)   Write down

            (i)    the mean distance, x , of the trees from the river bank;

            (ii)   the mean circumference, y , of the trees.                                              [2]

            (i)    the Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient,  r , for Barry’s results;

      A group of tourists went on safari to a game reserve.  The game warden wanted to know how
      many of the tourists saw Leopard (L), Cheetah (C ) or Rhino (R).   The results are given as
      follows.

                                  5 of the tourists saw all three
                                  7 saw Leopard and Rhino
                                  1 saw Cheetah and Leopard but not Rhino
                                  4 saw Leopard only
                                  3 saw Cheetah only

            (ii)   saw only one of the three types of animal;

            (iii) saw only Leopard, given that he saw only one of the three types of animal.         [6]

      (d)   If a tourist chosen at random from the group saw Leopard, find the probability that he
            also saw Cheetah.                                                                        [2]
