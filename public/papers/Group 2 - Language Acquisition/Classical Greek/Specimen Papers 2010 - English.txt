Translate into English the section of the following passage indicated between the asterisks. A translation
of the rest of the passage appears on the facing page.

1.    The Athenians were afraid that Paphlagonians were likely to kidnap some of their soldiers,
      so they invited their envoys to a banquet at which they hoped they could negotiate a
      peace agreement. At the banquet some Thracians provided entertainment by performing very
      elaborate dancing.                                                             [35 marks]

After they had made libations and sung the paean, two Thracians rose up first and began
a dance in full armour to the music of a flute, leaping high and lightly and using their
sabres; finally, one struck the other, as everybody thought.

After this a Mysian came in carrying a light shield in each hand, and at one moment in
his dance he would go through a pantomime as though two men were arrayed against
him, again he would use his shields as though against one antagonist, and again he would                                                     Total marks

Each word is assigned 0 or 1 or 2 points. Those worth 1 or 2 points indicate this value immediately
following the word, while those with zero points have no numerical indication.

A 1-point word (for example, an adverb or conjunction) needs only a correct translation to get the point.
For a two-point word, if the translation persuades you that the candidate understands the meaning of the
word, one point is awarded; if the candidate persuades you that the grammar of the word is understood,
then the second point is awarded.

When two words are joined by “_” they are to be treated as one word. A two-word phrase worth
two points includes one point for vocabulary and one point for grammar. The vocabulary point is
awarded only if both words are translated correctly in context; a vocabulary error in either or both words
results in no points for vocabulary. The grammar point is awarded if the phrase’s grammar is
understood correctly.

The maximum number of points is 140.

As soon as the soldiers saw Xenophon many of them rushed towards him and said: Now is
your opportunity, Xenophon to prove yourself a man. You have a city, you have triremes,
you have money, you have a great number of men. Now, should you so wish, you would
render us a service and we should make you great”.

Each word is assigned 0 or 1 or 2 points. Those worth 1 or 2 points indicate this value immediately
following the word, while those with zero points have no numerical indication.

A 1-point word (for example, an adverb or conjunction) needs only a correct translation to get the point.
For a two-point word, if the translation persuades you that the candidate understands the meaning of the
word, one point is awarded; if the candidate persuades you that the grammar of the word is understood,
then the second point is awarded.

When two words are joined by “_” they are to be treated as one word. A two-word phrase worth two
points includes one point for vocabulary and one point for grammar. The vocabulary point is awarded
only if both words are translated correctly in context; a vocabulary error in either or both words results in
no points for vocabulary. The grammar point is awarded if the phrase’s grammar is understood correctly.

In this particular case, there are 70 possible points.

1.     (a)   Adrestos had fallen from his chariot [1 mark] and Menelaus was standing over him
             [1 mark] with the apparent intention of killing him [1 mark]. Award any two of
             these marks.

       (b)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be

       (c)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct, no mark otherwise.

       (d)   Menelaus is more willing to negotiate [1 mark] Agamemnon is more brutal [1 mark].
             Any reasonable account of which is more typical should be awarded [1 mark].

       (e)   Adrestos, defeated, asks his conqueror to spare his life in exchange for a ransom [1 mark];
             Menelaos is willing to accept the ransom [1 mark] until Agamemnon persuades him not to
             [1 mark]. Adrestos and, at first, Menelaos behave entirely conventionally [1 mark] but
             Agamemnon, in successfully persuading Menelaos not to accept the ransom is probably less
             conventional [1 mark].

             guest-friendship and agree not to fight [1 mark].

       (b)   They exchange armour [1 mark] but Glaucos’ is worth more than ten times Diomedes’
             [1 mark].

       (c)   The women greet Hector as he enters the city [1 mark], they assume he has news and ask him
             for it [1 mark], he assumes that he can rebuke and command Paris [1 mark].
             Other ideas on their merits.

             side of the courtyard [1 mark]; the married daughters have the same arrangement with their
             husbands [1 mark] on the other side of the courtyard [1 mark].

       (e)   The climax of the joke is achieved in four ringing words in line 235 [1 mark]; at 238–239,
             a balance is neatly struck between wives and daughters [1 mark] seeking news [1 mark]
             and sons, brothers and husbands [1 mark]; the subject of the news [1 mark] at lines 242–250
             there is a detailed ekphrasis (no need to give the technical term) with much balancing
             repetition [1 mark]. Any five of these points or similar ones.

            The question will attract a range of answers; judge them on their merits.

      (d)   The Laws [1 mark] and the ‘Commonwealth’ of the state [1 mark]. They are abstracts and
            Plato treats them as self-conscious sentient beings [1 mark], deceived by the fact that though
            they are made up of sentient beings they are not themselves sentient [1 mark]. Other ideas on
            their merits.

             should be ready to die [1 mark]. Other accounts on their merits.

      (e)    Mark as short essay [3 marks].
