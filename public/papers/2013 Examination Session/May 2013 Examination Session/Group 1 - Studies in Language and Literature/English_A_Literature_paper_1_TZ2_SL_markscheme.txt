These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

     An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

     • discuss some ways in which Keegan links the First World War and the Second World War
       (for example, Hitler, numbers of dead, images of decay and destruction, piles of bodies,
       mass death)
     • recognize the structure of the piece and the development of the ideas
     • make some comment on the writer’s tone
     • make some comment on the choice of detail and effect of images, especially in
       paragraph two.

     A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

     •   analyse in greater depth the way in which the two world wars are linked
     •   comment in greater detail on the structure of the passage
     •   show a greater understanding of the cumulative power of the use of detail and imagery
     •   discuss the writer’s control of syntax to make his argument clear and persuasive
     •   consider persuasive techniques such as the emotive language, the two quotations, use of
         evidence.


2.

     An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

     • discuss the images the poet uses to build up a picture of the tourist
     • make some comment on the ways humour is created
     • make some comment on the structure of the poem.

     A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

     • discuss the way the particular responses of the tourist bring out the poet’s message
     • analyse the ways in which the tourist is portrayed (for example, the effects of the use of the
       first person, the brevity of lines, simple vocabulary, truncated syntax, lack of punctuation)
     • comment in greater detail on the choice of language to create playful and ironic humour
       (for example, “chequetacles”, “knickerbockers”, repeated use of the phrase “I am
       Tourist”).
