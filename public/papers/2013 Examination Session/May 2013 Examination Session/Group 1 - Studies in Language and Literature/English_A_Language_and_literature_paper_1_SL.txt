   We’re planning to take on homelessness
   this Christmas. Will you?
                               COLD WEATHER ALERT
Night-time temperatures are falling. When you’re homeless, Christmas can be the hardest time of all.
Cold, hungry and alone, there’s often nothing to enjoy, no one to be with, and little hope of anything
better. Where Christmas should be, there’s just an empty space.

You can help fill that space for someone, for just a few pounds – for £23.39, in fact.

Crisis is the national charity for single homeless people. We’re dedicated to ending homelessness and
changing lives, and for us Christmas is crucial. If we can welcome homeless people at this toughest
of times, with the offer of a good meal and good company, it can be the start of getting them off the
streets and out of homelessness for good.

We know that it works.

Since 1972, when we opened our doors for the very first Crisis at Christmas, we’ve seen how a little
comfort and support, given at the right time, can trigger a real, lasting change. John’s story (right)
shows how much your help could mean this Christmas.

To make this Crisis at Christmas all it could be, and to welcome as many guests as possible,
we need your help – and we need it urgently.

As the economic downturn hits home, people on the edge of homelessness are incredibly vulnerable –
and life for those already on the streets, in hostels, sleeping on people’s floors or crammed into bedsits
feels worse than ever. This Christmas, we want to double our efforts, and be ready to welcome more
guests than ever – and that is where your gift could be so crucial.

You can help us turn our plan into reality, by reserving a place at Crisis at Christmas for someone who’s
homeless today. One place costs just £23.39; two places costs £46.78; and if you were able, £233.90
would pay for a whole table, giving ten people a day to remember and a whole fresh start.


1 place = 3 hot meals, a new set of clothes, a health check, housing and job advice, and simple companionship
to feel human again.
You can help provide all this for one more guest, for just £23.39.

                   I’ve learned everything I know off of records. Being able to replay something immediately
             without all that terrible stricture of written music, the prison of those bars, those five lines.
             Being able to hear recorded music freed up loads of musicians that couldn’t necessarily afford
             to learn to read or write music, like me. Before 1900, you’ve got Mozart, Beethoven, Bach,
      5      Chopin, the cancan1. With recording, it was emancipation for the people. As long as you or
             somebody around you could afford a machine, suddenly you could hear music made by people,
             not set-up rigs and symphony orchestras. You could actually listen to what people were saying,
             almost off the cuff. Some of it can be a load of rubbish, but some of it was really good. It was the
             emancipation of music. Otherwise you’d have had to go to a concert hall, and how many people
     10      could afford that? It surely can’t be any coincidence that jazz and blues started to take over the
             world the minute recording started, within a few years, just like that. The blues is universal,
             which is why it’s still around. Just the expression and the feel of it came in because of recording.
             It was like opening the audio curtains. And available, and cheap. It’s not just locked into one
             community here and one community there and the twain shall never meet.
                                                                                                2

                   And of course that breeds another totally different kind of musician, in a generation.
             I don’t need this paper. I’m going to play it straight from the ear, straight from here, straight from
             the heart to the fingers. Nobody has to turn the pages.

                   Everything was available in Sidcup3 – it reflected that incredible explosion
             of music, of music as style, of love of Americana. I would raid the public library for books

             about America. There were people who liked folk music, modern jazz, trad jazz,
             people who liked bluesy stuff, so you’re hearing prototype soul4. All those influences
             were there. And there were the seminal sounds – the tablets of stone, heard for the first time.
