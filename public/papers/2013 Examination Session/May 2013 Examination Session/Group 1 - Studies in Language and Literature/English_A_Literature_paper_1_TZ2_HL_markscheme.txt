These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

     • recognize the situation and the characters involved
     • comment on the character and behaviour of Tsige, “The Queen”
     • comment on what emerges about the narrator, (for example, immigrant status, good doctor,
       Ethiopian background)
     • make some comment on the rhetorical quality of the outpouring, beginning on line 30.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

     •   comment on the ways in which the past lives of the immigrants are revealed
     •   analyse in greater depth the way Tsige is portrayed
     •   comment on the role of the narrator in relation to Tsige
     •   analyse in greater detail the rhetorical devices used by Tsige.


2.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

     • show an understanding that the poem is about specific memories of the persona’s
       childhood
     • make some comment on the treatment of time
     • comment on the way the images develop our impression of the persona’s experiences at the
       big house
     • comment on the role of the game and how it is used throughout.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

     • show a fuller awareness of the mingling of past and present, including the effect of the
       last line
     • analyse in greater detail the way in which sensual imagery is used to convey memories
     • comment on the structure and the changes in pace that occur throughout the poem.
