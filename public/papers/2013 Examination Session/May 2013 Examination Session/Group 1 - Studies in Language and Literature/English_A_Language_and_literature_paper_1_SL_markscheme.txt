Text 1

The text is a newspaper appeal to readers to give money urgently to provide as many homeless people as
possible with food, clothing, assistance and companionship on Christmas day.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• identify the objective of the appeal, recognize its urgency and refer to aspects of context such as
  Christmas with its traditions and values, or to the economic situation
• comment on the different argumentative elements used such as description of the problem and
  explanation of its causes, emphasis on “time” (Christmas) and “place” (a home), storytelling
  exemplification or the charity’s credentials
• identify and make some comment on techniques of language and style such as repetition, alliteration
  and the use of pronouns (we, you, he)
• identify and make some comment on aspects of layout, fonts and visuals which may include: use of
  bold type, white-on-black banners, “cold weather alert” font, snowflakes, gift tag, handwriting font,
  crenellated strip, logo and features of the photograph.


A good to very good analysis will also:

• analyse in more depth the argumentative strategies used, how they complement each other and work
  together to persuade the reader
• provide further comment on the contextual aspects such as the “economic downturn” and the charity’s
  stance on the problem of homelessness. This could include its implicit criticism of prevailing
  economic conditions and the government’s austerity measures
• analyse more fully the ways in which the text appeals to the reader through the emphasis on “time”
  and “place”, the use of facts and figures, or through pathos, particularly in the storytelling part with its
  emphasis on personal family history
• provide a more detailed and perhaps more synthetic assessment of the use and effectiveness of layout,
  font and visuals.

Text 2

In this illustrated extract from the memoirs of Rolling Stone Keith Richards, he explains how he learned
to play the guitar by listening to records.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• comment on the purpose of the text, such as the way it: links personal and collective experience;
  compares playing from written music and playing from recordings; teaches the reader something about
  the democratization of music in a historical context
• draw attention to some of the oppositions in the text for example, between old and new,
  rich and poor, playing from written music and intuitive playing
• comment on aspects of the text’s stylistic features, particularly use of the “prison” metaphor and how it
  and other elements of the handwritten note illustrate the text
• comment on the informality or conversational style (including the use of “you”) and refer to the sense
  of the excitement, romanticism or even heroism that it conveys.


A good to very good analysis will also:

• analyse the didactic as well as the ideological aspects of the values and assumptions present in the text
  (for example, Western bias, universalism, individualism, anti-elitism, the value attributed to intuition
  above learning). This may include identification of contradictions
• comment on the above values and assumptions in relation to historical context (the music revolution of
  the late 1950s and early 1960s) or to the personal history of the author (such as his limited knowledge
  of the history of music or that he went to art school not music school)
• analyse more fully the inclusion of the handwritten note in relation to the stylistic devices in the text,
  notably the extended “prison” metaphor and the freedom/captivity antithesis
• comment about the impact of the text on the reader – for example: tone, the use of humour, irony.
