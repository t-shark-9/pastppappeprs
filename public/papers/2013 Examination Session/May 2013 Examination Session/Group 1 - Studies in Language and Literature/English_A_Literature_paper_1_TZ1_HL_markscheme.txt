These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

     •   show an understanding of the situation or events portrayed
     •   comment on the use and effects of selected images, sentence structure and diction
     •   recognize the tension between father and son
     •   discuss the presentation and attitude of the narrator
     •   comment on the significance of “Rainbow” to the theme of the passage.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

     • discuss with greater precision the situation and the time frame of the extract
     • reveal a more analytical understanding of the variety of imagery and structural devices, and
       their impact on the reader
     • explore in more detail the family dynamics, including the mother
     • discuss in greater depth the repeated use of the word “Rainbow”
     • engage with the final five lines of the passage and their implications.


2.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

     • show an understanding of the nature of the poem (a meditation on communication
       stemming from an observation)
     • discuss the progression of the thoughts in the poem
     • explore the structure and form
     • comment on the use and effect of the imagery
     • comment on the relationship between language and knowing.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

     •   identify and engage with the sense of fear and foreboding which pervades the poem
     •   offer an interpretation of the impact of structure and form
     •   analyse with more precision judiciously chosen examples of imagery
     •   discuss the significance of the title and the final line in reference to the whole poem.
