These marking notes give additional information for marking paper 2. When marking the paper,
keep in mind that subject specific knowledge, as well as candidates’ personal opinions, are not
being assessed.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
(5 for criterion C) of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to
which they fail to meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

Word count

At SL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words. Failure to write the minimum
number of words will result in a 1-mark penalty under criterion A. There is no penalty for
exceeding 400 words: the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Criterion A – Language

A good answer will have few language gaps, and slips or flaws rarely affect meaning.


 Language
 Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
 affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
 fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
 forgetfulness.
 SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
 forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”
 FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are
 formed correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions
 (eg past simple versus present perfect)
 GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
 but do not appear.

1.   Cultural diversity

     Many of your friends have decided to have tattoos, but you disagree as this could have
     future negative consequences both socially and professionally. Write an article for the
     local newspaper’s Teen Talk section explaining your thoughts.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will clearly explain the context of teenagers and current trends
     • will take a negative view of tattooing
     • will describe future consequences, both social and professional, of having tattoos. If only
       one of the required elements is covered, the message should be judged as “partially
       communicated” (ie no more than [6 marks] should be awarded)
     • will present the argument in a persuasive manner
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • may support the case with personal experiences.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt an informal to semi-formal register
     • will have tone and style appropriate for teenagers (eg lively, direct, immediate)
     • will engage and involve the teenage readers
     • will have a distinct introduction, development and conclusion
     • will have a title
     • may have the name of the writer; this should be rewarded.


2.   Customs and traditions

     A friend from a different country and culture has written to tell you that he/she has been
     invited for a weekend to celebrate a special event in your country but has no idea what
     will happen! Write a set of guidelines explaining what will take place and what he/she
     should do.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will clearly identify the specific event
     • will provide a clear explanation of what will happen, what the friend should do and when
     • will provide supporting details, such as appropriate clothing, gifts, etc.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt an informal to semi-formal register
     • will set out the guidelines clearly, for example, bullets, sub-headings, numbering, etc
     • will help the reader by anticipating difficulties
     • may be in the framework of a letter or email
     • may have flashes of humour.

3.   Health

     The local government in your town has decided to give free medical care to people who
     do not smoke; however, people who do smoke will be required to pay for all their
     medical care. Write a letter to your local government representative expressing your
     viewpoint on this matter.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will present a clear and reasoned argument either for or against or balanced will give
       examples as evidence
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • may make persuasive use of appropriate personal experience
     • may use an opposing argument for rebuttal purposes; this should be rewarded.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt a formal register
     • will adopt a suitably serious tone
     • will incorporate the aspects of a formal letter: sender’s name and address, date, opening
       and closing salutations.


4.   Leisure

     Parents who attend their children’s competitive sports events are the best of fans, yet it
     could be argued that this puts more pressure on the children. As the captain of a sports
     team, you have been asked to speak at the Parent-Teacher Association’s monthly
     meeting about this situation. Write your speech.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will present the ideas in a clear, sequential manner
     • will acknowledge the parents’ standpoint
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • may use the captain’s personal experience effectively.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout the speech
     • will set out to catch the audience’s attention at the beginning, and leave a clear impression
       at the end
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
     • will adopt an engaging tone, involving the audience in the issue which concerns them
     • will use rhetorical devices (for example, addressing the audience, flashes of humour,
       rhetorical questions, repetition).

5.   Science and technology

     Film directors frequently use computers to change the scenes they film. Cloudy days are
     modified to blue skies and sunshine, for example. Your teacher has set the weekly essay
     on this topic and the title is: “Computer Improvements to Films: More enjoyable or
     cheating?” Write the essay.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will introduce the topic clearly
     • will mention both aspects, enjoyment and cheating, but may cover one more fully than the
       other
     • will take a definite stance or be balanced
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • may cite examples of computer enhancement of films; this should be rewarded.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
     • will have a distinct introduction, development and conclusion
     • will have a title
     • may use the first person, provided that the focus is on the arguments.
