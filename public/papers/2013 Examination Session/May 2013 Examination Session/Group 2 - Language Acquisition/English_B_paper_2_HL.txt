1.    Cultural diversity

      You are taking part in a class debate on the motion: “When people move to another country and wish
      to adapt well, they should adopt its culture and forget about their own”. Write the text of the debate’s
      opening speech, either agreeing or disagreeing with this motion.


2.    Customs and tradition

      You think it may be better for all members of your local sports club to adhere to a strict dress code
      when using the club’s facilities. As a member of the club, write a proposal to the sports club manager
      suggesting what the dress code could be and what the benefits of applying the dress code are.


3.    Health

      Stress is one of the reasons why many students do not do well in their exams. Write a pamphlet to be
      distributed to students at your school in which you explain the possible symptoms as well as causes
      of stress, and suggest ways in which they can be avoided.


4.    Leisure

      Your school organized an art exhibition for the works of the IB visual arts students. You visited the
      exhibition and were impressed by the variety and quality of the works presented. Write a review of
      this exhibition to be published in your school magazine.


5.    Science and technology

      You have recently interviewed the inventor of a domestic robot that will have a great impact on
      our lives. Write an article based on this interview to be published in a youth magazine. Do not simply
      write the exact words (transcript) of the interview.

studied in class. Write 150 to 250 words.

6.     We are always encouraged to donate money to the poor. Yet, Mother Teresa* said: “Being unwanted,
       unloved, uncared for, forgotten by everybody […] is a much greater hunger, a much greater poverty
       than the person who has nothing to eat”.

                                                                        Source: www.endpovertyinternational.org (2012)
