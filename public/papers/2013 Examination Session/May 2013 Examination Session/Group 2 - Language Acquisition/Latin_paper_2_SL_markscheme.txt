General notes:
 The following paragraphs are to be considered suggestions, rather than prescriptions, that is, all points
  made by candidates to be marked on their merits.
 Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
 The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: for example, double mention of alliteration.


Elegiac and Lyric poetry

1.   (a)   This is an ode addressed to young men of military age (no Latin required) [1 mark].
           Award [1 mark] (up to two) for any of the following:
            these young men must be tough and skilled with weapons
            they must inspire terror in the enemy
            they must live life in the open and in presence of real danger.
           Other answers to be marked on their merits. Accept both Latin and English

     (b)   Parthia is an Eastern/Asiatic kingdom with which Romans had frequent disputes (or similar –
           but if the answer refers to “Iran” it must specify “modern Iran”) [1 mark]. The reference to
           the Parthians emphasizes that young men must have no greater purpose than to prepare
           themselves for fighting [1 mark] against this group of people, which so preoccupied the
           Romans [1 mark]. Or something of a similar content.

     (c)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark].
           Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

     (d)   Accept answers such as metaphor (the warrior is compared to lions); hyperbaton; mingled
           word order (reflecing entangled man and lion) [1 mark]. Dangerous lion (asperum tactu
           leonem) [1 mark]. It (asperum tactu) suggests not only ferocity at the touch but also tangible
           roughness [1 mark]. Quotation of the Latin is not required, but an explanation of the chosen
           rhetorical device must be given.

     (e)   The main idea is celebrating the dying for one’s country [1 mark]. The remaining [2 marks]
           must be awarded for remarks related to the fact that in certain situations a man’s life is a
           punishment; and then it is for him to positively exploit this fact by dying for his country; or
           that the man who shows cowardice loses everything – even his life.
           Other answers to be marked on their merits.
                                                 –4–               M13/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Award [1 mark] each (up to two) for words such as vivamus (in its sense of enjoying life) and
           amemus (love and life are identical in Catullus’s opinion). Award [1 mark] for an explanation
           such as: we must make the most of our available time; or: the sun can die and rise again but
           humans cannot (if words such as soles and redire are quoted).

     (b)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.

     (c)   Award [1 mark] each for answers such as:
            the poet introduces an effective juxtaposition of the words omnes unius
            strictly speaking this is an oxymoron
            figurative use of as for something of little value
            the position of the words omnes unius emphasizes that little regard should be given to
             gossip
            hissing sibilants of these two words.

     (d)   Catullus uses the verb conturbabimus [1 mark] which means to throw one’s accounts into
           confusion (or similar reference to accounting jargon) or: to throw into confusion [1 mark].
           By using this word, Catullus compares himself and his lover with fraudsters/bankrupts or:
           Catullus and Lesbia in this way will cheat the evil eye [1 mark]. There are different possible
           meanings of the word and different ways of explaining its effect, but meaning and explanation
           of effect must be consistent.

     (e)   Award [1 mark] each for any set of polarities: soles/nox; lux/nox; semel/una; semel/redire;
           brevis/perpetua. Answers can be given either in Latin or English.
                                                    –5–                M13/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Epic

3.     (a)   For the first question accept details such as: son of Jupiter/Hammon/by a Garamantidian
             nymph/king of the Getulians [1 mark] (do not accept “wanted to marry Dido” without further
             qualification). For the second question award [1 mark] each for details such as: he has
             honoured Iupiter; set up a hundred enormous temples by his dominions; performed sacrifices;
             he showed his fidelity to Iupiter, etc

       (b)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct; no mark otherwise.

       (c)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number, etc). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
             awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
             no mark should be awarded.

       (d)   Award [1 mark] each for the identification of expressions such as femina, nostris in finibus,
             errans, exiguam, pretio, litus arandum, loci leges (NB: answers must give some explanation
             of how the details fit into the context of the passage, but quotation of Latin is not mandatory)
             and any explanation of how Iarbas performed all these acts of charity and she rejected his
             offer of marriage.

       (e)   Accept a range of answers, awarding [1 mark] each for remarks such as: alliteration of the
             letters “f” and “m” (counts for [2 marks] if two distinct examples are given); Iarbas imitates
             the accent of the Trojans denoting and mocking their Asian origin; the alliteration’s effect is
             to give a sense of violent contempt to Iarba’s closing words.


4.     (a)   Award [1 mark] each (up to four) for any point such as:
              he is out of his mind/mad, etc: amens
              his hair raised in horror: arrectae horrore comae
              speechless: vox faucibus haesit

              go quickly: fuga
              etc

       (b)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct, no mark otherwise.

       (c)   Aeneas requests Mnestheus, Serestus and Sergestus to make the fleet ready (in silence), gather
             the crews to the shore, order the armament and hide the cause of his altered plans.
             Award [1 mark] for each order.

       (d)   Award [2 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number, etc). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
             awarded [1 mark]. Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

       (e)   Dido was love-sick [1 mark]; did not know anything about Aeneas’s plans [1 mark]; and
             would not expect the break off of their love [1 mark]. Other answers to marked on their own
             merits.
                                                 –6–               M13/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Historiography

5.   (a)   Poppaea is Nero’s mistress [1 mark]; Agrippina is Nero’s mother [1 mark]; Octavia is
           married to Nero [1 mark].

     (b)   Nero was an orphan boy/ward (pupillum) [1 mark], under the rule of others (iussis alienis
           obnoxius) [1 mark], devoid of power/empire and of liberty (qui non modo imperii sed
           libertatis etiam indigeret) [1 mark].

     (c)   Award [1 mark] (up to three) for any substantiated remark such as:
            dramatic speech predominant in this section
            crisis presented in a dramatic rather than analytic manner
            dramatic speeches predominantly about private themes and take place in private contexts
            genuine political life and interests replaced by private relationships
            unvirtuous characters reflect the Principate’s state of affairs
            power is a very personal thing in Nero’s principate, and the three women depicted are in
             various ways involved with it.

     (d)   Former husband of Poppaea [1 mark]; divorced when she became Nero’s mistress [1 mark];
           later (AD 69 – date is not required, but if given must be exact) became emperor himself

           Rome [1 mark]. Others details (e.g. favourite holiday resorts of Roman aristocracy) to be
           marked on their merits.

     (b)   Nero hesitates as to the means to kill his mother: to do it by sword [1 mark], poison [1 mark]
           or some other means [1 mark].

     (c)   Britannicus was the son of Claudius and Messalina [1 mark]; Agrippina manoeuvred him out
           of his natural position as Claudius’s successor [1 mark]. He was reportedly killed by Nero
           [1 mark].

     (d)   Anicetus was commander of the fleet at Misenum/had been Nero’s attendant in his childhood
           [1 mark]. He proposes to build a vessel which could be so constructed as to collapse when it
           was at sea [1 mark] so that it could throw Agrippina unawares into the water [1 mark].

                                                  –7–               M13/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Letters

7.   (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.

     (b)   Best food for the host and a few others, cheap for the rest [1 mark]; wine of three qualities in
           small flasks [1 mark]; for friends, lesser friends and freedmen [1 mark]. Other answers to be
           marked on their merits.

     (c)   The phrase redigere, cogere in ordinem (“to reduce an officer to the ranks”) indicates
           restraining/keeping under control [1 mark]. It is used here to match the strong language of the
           passage, making everybody equal regardless of their position in society [1 mark] and laying
           emphasis on the moral tone and position – already put forward in the letter [1 mark]. Other
           answers to be marked on their merits.

     (d)   Friends are arranged in separate groups, or: get different treatments [1 mark]. There is a clear
           hyerarchy (cf. gradatim) [1 mark]. Discrimination is not according to intimacy but on the
           grounds of social status (because Pliny himself is receiving the best food) [1 mark]. Other
           answers to be marked on their merits.

     (e)   Pliny gives all his guests the same treatment; he treats every guest equal to himself in all
           particulars [1 mark]. He treats freedmen as equal to himself (because, when he places an
           invitation, he regards them as companions not as freedmen) [1 mark]. (This does not put
           Pliny to great expense because) he drinks what the freedmen do rather than vice versa
           [1 mark].


8.   (a)   The letter is addressed to the Emperor Trajan [1 mark]. When travelling through a distant
           part of the province, in Nicomedia [1 mark], a huge fire destroyed many private houses
           [1 mark], and two public buildings (the Gerusia and the temple of Isis) [1 mark].

     (b)   Gerusia: a sort of old men’s residence [1 mark], an establishment where old men could be
           cared for free [1 mark].
           Iseon: temple of Isis [1 mark]; Isis is the Egyptian goddess [1 mark], worshipped as the ideal
           mother and wife as well as patron of nature and magic.

     (c)   Because there was a strong wind (cf. violentia venti) [1 mark], the citizens were lazy/they did
           not react rapidly to extinguish the fire [1 mark] and there was no pump, bucket or any
           apparatus for fighting fire [1 mark].

     (d)   Collegia fabrorum were associations formed by workmen/craftmen [1 mark]. Pliny has to
           ask for Trajan’s approval because in his mandata Trajan had ordered the dissolution of clubs
           in the cities of the provinces/Pliny limits the number to 150 because he wants to supervise
           them and prevent the organization of political demonstrations and even riots [1 mark].

     (e)   Award [2 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should
           be awarded [1 mark]. Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

            away [1 mark].

      (c)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct, no mark otherwise.
            [2 marks]

      (d)   Contempt is ugly (turpis) and poverty sharp (acris) [1 mark]; contempt and poverty
            apparently lingering at death’s portal (quasi leti portas cunctarier ante) [1 mark];
            those devoid of position and wealth see themselves as deprived of security and pleasure
            (dulci vita stabilique) [1 mark]. Juxtaposition of contempt and poverty to pleasure and
            security (contemptus, egestas-dulci stabilique) [1 mark].

      (e)   Award [1 mark] (up to four) for any remark such as the following (no marks if the Latin text
            is not given):
             want to flee away (effugisse, etc)
             amass a fortune with civil blood (sanguine civili rem conflant)
             double their riches (divitias conduplicant avidi)

            somno corpus) [1 mark], change expression (mutare vultum) [1 mark] and guide and steer the
            whole individual (hominen totum regere ac versare) [1 mark].

            [2 marks].

            time (una) in/with the body [1 mark]. Award [3 marks] if the adverbs pariter and una are
            rendered correctly, otherwise only two or one mark as appropriate.

      (d)   When the body is weakened by a non-lethal injury [1 mark] there follows a fainting [1 mark]
            and a will to rise afoot [1 mark]. Accept other answers correctly drawn from the text and
            mark accordingly.
