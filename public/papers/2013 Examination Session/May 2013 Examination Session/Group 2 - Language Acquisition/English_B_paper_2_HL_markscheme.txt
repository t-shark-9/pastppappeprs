These marking notes give additional information for marking paper 2. When marking both sections,
keep in mind that subject specific knowledge, as well as candidates’ personal opinions, are not
being assessed.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
(5 for criterion C) of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to
which they fail to meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

Word count

At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in Section A and 150 words in
Section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a 1-mark penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in Section A or 250 words in Section B:
the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Criterion A – Language

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.


 Language
 Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
 affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
 fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
 forgetfulness.
 SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
 forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”
 FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are
 formed correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions
 (eg past simple versus present perfect)
 GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
 but do not appear.

                                          SECTION A

1.   Cultural diversity

     You are taking part in a class debate on the motion: “When people move to another
     country and wish to adapt well, they should adopt its culture and forget about their
     own”. Write the text of the debate’s opening speech, either agreeing or disagreeing with
     this motion.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will take a clear position of either agreement or disagreement with the motion; if the script
       fails to take a clear position, it may achieve the 5-6 band only if the ideas that are
       developed are “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
     • will provide support for the argument/s
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • may use an opposing argument for rebuttal purposes; this should be rewarded
     • may make effective use of personal experience; this should be rewarded.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout the speech
     • will set out to catch the audience's attention at the beginning, and leave a clear impression
       at the end
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register, perhaps with flashes of informality
     • will use rhetorical devices (for example, addressing the audience, flashes of humour,
       rhetorical questions, repetition)
     • may give an early summary, or “map”, of what is going to be said; this should be
       rewarded.
                                                 –5–        M13/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Customs and traditions

     You think it may be better for all members of your local sports club to adhere to a strict
     dress code when using the club’s facilities. As a member of the club, write a proposal to
     the sports club manager suggesting what the dress code could be and what the benefits
     of applying the dress code are.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will describe the suggested dress code. This is flexible and may involve clothing for sport
       or in the clubhouse
     • will state the benefits of applying the suggested dress code
     • will include both the description and the benefits; if the script fails to cover one of the
       requirements, it may achieve the 5-6 band if the ideas that are developed are reasonably
       “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
     • may mention why dress codes are important in general; this should be rewarded.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will use features such as headings, short clear paragraphs, sections identified by
       numbers/letters/bullets, insetting, even if in the framework of a formal letter or email
     • will adopt a formal register
     • will direct the proposal to the specified audience
     • will persuade through an enthusiastic tone


3.   Health

     Stress is one of the reasons why many students do not do well in their exams. Write a
     pamphlet to be distributed to students at your school in which you explain the possible
     symptoms as well as causes of stress, and suggest ways in which they can be avoided.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will clearly explain the possible symptoms and causes of stress
     • will persuasively suggest ways (give advice) in which students can avoid stress
     • will address the three elements of symptoms, causes and advice. If the script covers only
       two of the required elements it may achieve the 5-6 band only if the ideas that are
       developed are “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”. If only one
       of the required elements is covered, the message should be judged as “partially
       communicated” (ie no more than [4 marks] should be awarded)
     • may thoughtfully anticipate difficulties that the target audience of students may experience.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will incorporate aspects of a pamphlet: bullets, sub-headings, etc
     • will adopt an informal to semi-formal register
     • will have an evidently supportive tone
     • may include examples, such as personal anecdotes; this should be rewarded.
                                                   –6–        M13/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   Leisure

     Your school organized an art exhibition for the works of the IB visual arts students.
     You visited the exhibition and were impressed by the variety and quality of the works
     presented. Write a review of this exhibition to be published in your school magazine.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will mainly concern itself with an evaluation of the event, emphasizing the variety and
       quality of the works
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • may provide descriptions of the works on display
     • may recommend the readers to visit the exhibition.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will have a title
     • will adopt a consistent register (informal, semi-formal or formal)
     • will use a lively, direct style aimed to interest and entertain the readers
     • will express enthusiasm
     • may have sub-headings
     • may use a system of ratings; this should be rewarded.


5.   Science and technology

     You have recently interviewed the inventor of a domestic robot that will have a great
     impact on our lives. Write an article based on this interview to be published in a youth
     magazine. Do not simply write the exact words (transcript) of the interview.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
     • will explain in detail how the domestic robot will affect our lives
     • will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
     • will select and organize the material around an overall point, theme or issue
     • may give some biographical information about the inventor.

     Criterion C – Format
     • will adopt a semi-formal register
     • will have a headline / title, and a byline (author’s name, date and possibly location)
     • will refer to the interview but not be a verbatim transcript; a verbatim transcript would
       result in a maximum [2 marks] for Criterion C
     • will present the information in a lively, interesting way
     • may incorporate direct quotations; this should be rewarded
     • may have flashes of humour; this should be rewarded.
                                                 –7–       M13/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                         SECTION B

6.   Personal response

     We are always encouraged to donate money to the poor. Yet, Mother Teresa said:
     “Being unwanted, unloved, uncared for, forgotten by everybody […] is a much greater
     hunger, a much greater poverty than the person who has nothing to eat”.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Argument
     • will address the issue of physical poverty versus emotional poverty; scripts which do not
       address this issue should be marked down under “relevance”
     • will make the candidate’s viewpoint clear: the candidate may write a balanced argument or
       a polemic, an analytic approach, etc
     • will provide clear, coherent and detailed reasons for the candidate’s viewpoint/s
     • may take unexpected, creative approaches, provided that there is a link to the key point in
       the stimulus
     • may personalize the issue by providing brief examples drawn from the candidate’s own
       experience; this should be rewarded.
