Introduction
This case study is intended to act as a starting point for investigating a number of topics related to the use
of mobile devices. These include:
•   the technology underpinning mobile devices
•   the application and evolution of mobile devices in society
•   social and ethical issues, such as security and privacy, relating to the use of mobile devices
•   independent research linked to the additional terminology in this case study.

Mobile devices have become essential requirements for people living in the modern world. Whether it be
for business men and women keeping track of appointments or for working on the move, teenagers keeping
in (almost permanent) touch with friends or relaxing to music, or simply as a must-have fashion accessory,
the mobile device in its various forms has become a prominent symbol of today’s world. It is advances
in technology coupled with our insatiable desire for communication that has driven the evolution from
the early days of the palm top computer to today’s smartphone and, no doubt, to more complex forms in
the future.

Fundamentals
Memory

Mobile devices have the following
types of memory built in:
•   ROM (firmware)
•   Cache Memory
•   RAM
•   Flash Memory.

Additional memory is also provided
for some devices through the use of
memory cards.


Operating Systems

In comparison to the dominance that
Microsoft experiences with computer
operating systems (OS), there is no
such dominance with mobile devices,
as illustrated by the accompanying
graph, which shows the share of sales
in August 2010. The most popular OS                 [Source: www.allaboutsymbian.com/features/item/Keeping_It_Clean.php]
is Symbian, which is an open-source

Communication
Mobile devices rely on their ability to communicate both with each other and with fixed devices such as
personal computers. At times this communication is direct, but at other times a mobile phone (cell phone)
network is used. There are various methods of communication, each with its own protocol, and each
providing certain advantages and disadvantages when compared with one another.

Bluetooth2
A common means of communication is Bluetooth, which uses radio waves in the frequency band
2.402 GHz – 2.480 GHz to allow Bluetooth enabled devices to automatically connect with each other.
Once a connection is made, data can be transferred in either direction, although this will depend upon the
security mode selected for each device. One important use for this is the synchronization of data between
two devices.

The power consumed in communicating is very low and consequently the range is limited. However,
signals can pass through the walls of a building as line-of-sight is not required.

When a connection is made between two or more devices a piconet (personal area network) is formed.
Several piconets can exist within the same area without interfering with each other. This is achieved both
by frequency hopping and by the use of device addresses.

An example of multiple piconets is shown below.

The number of devices that incorporate Bluetooth has increased dramatically since its conception,
as are the uses to which they are put. These include the use of Bluetooth headsets and Bluetooth enabled
GPS devices.

Other Communication Technologies
In addition to Bluetooth there are other means of communication between mobile devices, each having their
own advantages and disadvantages. These include the following:
•   Wi-Fi
•   Mobile Phone (Cell Phone) Networks
•   Infra-Red
•   USB
•   Ethernet
•   WiMAX
•   Firewire.

Interfaces
People will not pay for complex technology if they are unable to use it. The means of interacting with their
mobile device has become as important a factor in buying it as the functions that it actually carries out.
Consequently, companies have devoted considerable time and money into researching ways of providing
easy access to multiple functions on a device small enough to fit into your pocket.  The keyboard and the
touch screen have become the two most common interfaces.

Keyboard
A variety of different keyboards have been incorporated into most mobile devices (although some are
touch screen only). Manufacturers have tried to overcome the limitations of space with various designs
or techniques, some of which are listed below:
•   detachable keyboards
•   scroll wheel
•   thumb wheel
•   multi-touch.

Touch screen
The touch screen has played an important role since the days of the original PDAs and has appeared in
various incarnations ever since.

The original touch screens provided a limited number of options but modern versions provide multi-level
menus and the ability to “scroll” through various screens.

Styluses have been used with touch screens combined with a form of handwriting recognition (Graffiti).



                                                            The iPhone 4 includes a panel laminated
                                                            on the glass which uses electrical
                                                            fields to sense the user’s touch.   It has
                                                            a multi-touch feature that can register
                                                            simultaneous touches. The user can
                                                            bring up different information or menus
                                                            by actions such as swiping, tapping and
                                                            pinching. Information is displayed on

Generations
The communications industry has found it convenient to refer to major advances in mobile phone
technology in terms of generations, a generation appearing approximately every 10 years. The International
Telecommunication Union4 has attempted to standardize the industry by detailing the features expected in
each generation, some of which are listed in the table below.

    1G        1979      • First generation deals with the analog transmission of data.

    2G        1991      • Digital transmission of data.
                        • Speed in terms of Kilobits per second.

    3G        2001      • Much faster speeds (in terms of Megabits per second).
                        • Good for multimedia/video streaming.
                        • Data sent in packets.
                        • Simultaneous use of speech and data services.
                        • New frequency bands, higher data rates and non-backwards-compatible
                          transmission technology.
                        • 3G networks offer greater security than their 2G predecessors. By allowing the
                          equipment to authenticate the network it is attached to, the user can be sure the
                          network is the intended one and not an impersonator.

    4G        2011      • Speed in terms of Gigabits per second.
                        • All networks will be IP packet-switched.

New technologies can either be known as:

• a revolution (not backwards-compatible so a new frequency spectrum is needed)
• an evolution (which can use the same frequency-bands).

Security
Smartphones are as susceptible as normal computers to attacks from outside sources including viruses,
phishing and social engineering efforts. However, as no one operating system dominates the smartphone
market, data is more likely to be compromised by leaving the device in the back of a taxi than through
virus attacks.5




                                                   Symbian Skull Virus

                                                   This virus produces a flashing skull animation in the
                                                   background regardless of what application is being used.6




Following the advice given below will reduce the chances of data loss:
•   encrypt all data that a smartphone receives
•   clear all caches after each VPN (Virtual Private Network) session
•   choose one with a “kill” switch
•   password before opening applications such as e-mail, web browser
•   keep data permanently in your data centre, not on the smartphone
•   some companies can wipe the data off your stolen smartphone remotely
•   only run apps approved by the phone company
•   do not use unsecured Wi-Fi networks (to avoid “man-in-the-middle” attacks)
•   do not “jail-break” your smartphone.7

Smartphone Applications
The smartphone manufacturers main target has been the general public (particularly the young)
who want to be in touch whenever and wherever, and business people, many of whom now see their phone
as indispensable in organizing their working lives.

However the smartphone is increasingly finding its way into specialized markets, either by the manufacturers
themselves customizing their units to a particular profession or fuelled by the application (apps) market
which allow users to download specific software modules developed by independent companies.

One such targeted market is the medical profession, which is fast swapping its pagers for smartphones.
Links to reference material have become standard aids for many doctors, but increasingly specialized
applications are becoming available. One such application not only alerts them to emergencies (as would
a pager) but automatically accesses and displays information from the relevant patient’s files or lab results.

Others are able to link in with monitoring equipment that can send data from, for example, an ambulance
that is bringing in a patient or images from equipment monitoring a pregnant woman in the hospital.

However, there are concerns regarding privacy of data and data security with such applications.

The diagram below shows a small selection of the different uses of a smartphone.

Effects on Society
Mankind’s development has been driven in part by social instincts, the desire for improving quality of life
and the need for better and better communication. Rapid technological advances, particularly over the last
two decades, have led to the ability to be connected 24/7. However, opinion is divided on the effect that
this has had on the quality of life of users. Consider the following articles.

Article 1

    Always On: One Third of Employees Feel the Need to Stay Connected 24/7
    For a lot of us, the Internet has made it possible to work from anywhere and connect to work at any time.
    Without a doubt, this 24/7 connectivity is both a blessing and a curse. According to a new survey by
    web conferencing firm InterCall, 30 % of workers in the U.S. who use technology to do their jobs
    feel the need to stay connected to work 24/7, even during weekends, breaks and holidays. One in two
    workers also say that taking time off is becoming increasingly challenging.

    Clearly, the current economic climate isn’t helping employees to relax. Almost 40 % of all respondents
    noted that they are doing the job of two people because of the impact of the economic recession on
    their company. Today, 25 % of workers think that their supervisors expect them to be online and
    connected to work after hours and that their job security depends on this. Almost 15 % of respondents
    say that they plan to attend at least one work-related call or web meeting during their next vacation and
    17 % say that it is frowned upon if they don’t connect to work during their vacations.

Article 2

    My Mobile Phone
    “It’s right by my bed when I go to sleep and right by my bed when I wake-up and it’s like the first thing
    I go to,” 15-year-old Sarah Matzkin told CNN.

    “If someone responds right away, you’re like yay they responded and if someone responds two to three
    hours later you’re like, what’s going on?”8

Welcome to the Future
It would seem that today’s smartphone has everything: a combination of mobile phone, computer,
web browser, camera, social networking device, amongst others, and at a size to fit in your pocket.  
What more could you want? Yet, in 10 years time, today’s “must-have” devices will be consigned to the
trash can, to be replaced be new products of man’s ingenuity, fuelled by the knowledge that people will
continually be seduced by the “next big thing”.

Nobody can be completely sure of just how mobile devices such as the smartphone will evolve, but each
company’s research teams will already have their own ideas about how the future might unfold.

One such idea is Nokia’s concept phone, Nokia Morph9, which suggests how nanotechnology may become
involved in transforming our phone into the ultimate fashion accessory. Why should the phone look like a
phone when it can become a bracelet, a pendant, or basically anything else that looks good?
