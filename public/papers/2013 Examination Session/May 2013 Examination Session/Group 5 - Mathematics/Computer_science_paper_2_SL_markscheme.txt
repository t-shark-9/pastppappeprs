Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2
and [30 marks] for question 3. Maximum total = [70 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording
        can be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
        minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
        grammatical accuracy.

      Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks
        should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

1.   (a)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           A syntax error could occur (in Java with mixed mode [int] = [int]*[double]);
           A run-time error could occur in other languages;
           Excess memory could be used up (int entered as String);
           You would not be able to use the data as intended (int stored as String –
           cannot use maths or loss of precision);                                        [2 marks]

     (b)   eg a set of yes/no;
           responses to a series of questions;                                            [2 marks]

     (c)   Award marks as follows up to [5 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for initialization of total(s);
           Award [1 mark] for loop;
           Award [1 mark] for correct check;
           Award [1 mark] for correct total incremented;
           Award [1 mark] for correct outputs (some text is necessary);
           Award at most [1 mark] for written responses with correct logic;
           Example answer:
           void howMany()
           {
             int yesTotal = 0;
             int noTotal = 0;
             for (int x = 0; x < 100; x++)
             {
                if (array[x] = true)
                {
                  yesTotal = yesTotal + 1;
                }
                else
                {
                  noTotal = noTotal + 1;
                }
             }
             output (“ Yes total =: “+ yesTotal);
             output (“ No total =: “+ noTotal);
           }                                                                              [5 marks]

           Note: Solution can just update one total with the other being calculated at
           the end.

     (d)   A 2-D array;
           Of real (accept any numerical type);                                           [2 marks]

Question 1 continued

     (e)   Award [1 mark] per line but do not accept OUTPUT as return
           Example answer:
           double adams()
           {
             double total = 0;
             for (int x = 0; x < 12; x++)
             {
                total = total + array[0][x];
             }
             return total;
           }                                                                             [5 marks]

     (f)   Store the names in a 1-D array of string;
           Each index in this array will link correctly to the same row index in the
           table;                                                                        [2 marks]

     (g)   Change the 4th line to total = total + array[a][x];
           And pass the variable a as a parameter, where it represents the position of
           the employee in the list;
           Accept written answers if the above is correctly outlined.                    [2 marks]
                                                    –8–              M13/5/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Award up to [2 marks max].
           The value –1 will not be a valid exam mark;
           So it can be used to indicate that that test has not yet been taken;
           So as not to make wrong calculations;                                         [2 marks]

     (b)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           Calculating the average involves a division;
           Which could lead to a decimal value;
           Which could lead to point values/numbers;
           Decimals are stored as a double;                                              [3 marks]

     (c)   Award marks as follows up to [6 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for initialization of ALL variables;
           Award [1 mark] for correct loop;
           Award [1 mark] for only adds appropriate marks;
           Award [1 mark] for count increased;
           Award [1 mark] for the test;
           Award [1 mark] for average calculated when count != 0;
           Award [1 mark] for correct return;

           Example answer:
           public double average()
           {
             double averageMark = -1;
             int total = 0;
             int count = 0;
             for (int x = 0; x < 15; x++)
             {
                if (marks[x] != -1)
                {
                  total = total + marks[x];
                  count = count + 1;
                }
             }
             if (count != 0)
             {
                averageMark = total / count;
             }
             return averageMark;
           }                                                                             [6 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for correct header;
           Award [1 mark] for return statement;
           Award [2 marks] for correctly calculating average mark for each student
           (award [1 mark max] for a reasonable attempt);
           Award [1 mark] for temp created as a Student object;
           Award [1 mark] for includes a recognizable bubble sort;
           Award [1 mark] for sort compares average marks;
           Award [1 mark] for correct dot notation used in comparison;

           Example answer:
           public Student[] bubbleSort(Student[]s)
           {
             for (int x=0: x<25; x++)
             {
                s[x].averageMark = s[x].average();
             }

             boolean swapped = true;
             while (swapped)
             {
                swapped = false;
                for (int i = 1; i < 25; i++)
                {
                  if (s[i-1].averageMark < s[i].averageMark)
                  {
                    temp = s[i-1];
                    s[i-1] = s[i];
                    s[i] = temp;

           Note: There are several ways of writing a bubble sort.

     (e)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           Note: the example does not encapsulate as private – threat as theory answer
           It is safer;
           Because using different arrays would make keeping data for one student
           more difficult to keep together;
           Less chance of data being overwritten from other modules;
           It is more convenient for programming;
           As programming with objects allows advantages of modularity;
           eg use of a team of programmers taking specific modules;                      [3 marks]

           does have a fixed life;
           MUST include example eg could contain a downloaded app one moment
           and then an MP3 file the next;                                                 [2 marks]

           Putting a strain on / filling the capacity of the Internet lines;              [3 marks]

     (e)   Award [2 marks] for good discussion of positive examples;
           Award [2 marks] for good discussion of negative examples;
           Award up to [2 marks] for a justified conclusion;
           Examples could include amongst others:
           positive:
           Quizzes downloaded from the teacher (via Bluetooth)
           Real-time research on lesson topic
           negative:
           Using Internet for cheating
           Distraction by social networking sites                                         [6 marks]

     (f)   The ADC chip is needed to translate digital signals (eg music files);
           To analogue signals (sound);                                                   [2 marks]

Question 3 continued

     (i)   If the phone is lost (eg back of taxi);
           Then the network provider can disable it preventing data loss/maintaining
           security;

           Award [1 mark] for preventing data loss / help current security issue – ie
           phone can be disabled if being found to be misused.                          [2 marks]

     (j)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           A pixel is the smallest element on a screen that can be addressed by the
           memory;
           By increasing the pixel density more elements can be addressed on the same
           area of screen;
           Therefore more data from an image can be displayed in the same area;
           Making the image appear sharper;
           Although continually increasing resolution will reach a point where the
           human eye no longer perceives the difference;                                [3 marks]
