Mark Allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 60 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
        a semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
        got wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
        minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
        grammatical accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

NOTE: The notation used in question parts 16(b) and 16(c) is off-syllabus, and after
      analysis during the standardisation process it has been decided to discount
      these question parts. Please only award NR for these question parts
      regardless of working.

      one;
      A static data structure does not use pointers, and obeys the specific operations of the
      data structure;

      Truncation error:
      A real value is assigned to an integer variable;

      Overflow error:
      We try to store a number that is too big to be represented in the allocated number of
      bits;
      For example, an integer in two’s complement, or a floating-point where the exponent
      exceeds the allowed range of representation;
      Underflow error:
      We try to store a number that is too small, usually it is assimilated to zero;
      It can cause run-time errors (division by zero) or trivialize calculations to zero;       [4 marks]

17.   (a)   Award up to [2 marks max].
            Requirements;
            Costs;
            Benefits;
            Estimates of the time for developing the project;
            Possible difficulties and alternative solutions;
            Risk analysis (costs/technical/legal);
            Review of previously proposed solutions;                                              [2 marks]

      (b)   Award [1 mark] for identifying a factor and [1 mark] for an expansion that
            relates that factor to commercial or customized software up to [4 marks max].
            Example factors to be considered:
                  Cost;
                  Time to develop/deploy;
                  Availability of documentation and training materials;
                  Suitability of the software for the task;

            Example expansions:
                 Cost –          Commercial software is usually cheaper to purchase than
                                 developing customized software;
                 Suitability – Commercial software is usually designed to appeal to a
                                 large group of potential customers and may not contain
                                 specialized features needed by the company / may contain
                                 needlessly complex tools to support functions not needed
                                 by the company;                                                  [4 marks]
            Accept other realistic factors and expansions.

      (c)   The customer could ask for modifications;
            Adding some new/different features that affect the current design;
            And that could affect the feasibility report in several ways;
            Such as costs, delivery time, technical requirements;                                 [4 marks]
            Accept these points if put in the context of “repeated analysis and design”.

            OR

            23*9+ ;

      (b)   Pre-order;                                                                        [1 mark]

      (c)     329;                                                                          [1 mark]

      (d)   Perform post-order traversal on the tree;
            Use a stack to put   329;
            Pop from stack (to reverse it) and get the postfix representation;

            OR

            Perform post-order traversal on the tree;
            Store the data in a queue;
            Dequeue and get the postfix expression;                                          [3 marks]

      (e)   A binary tree is structurally self-referential (by definition of binary tree);
            Because each node in the tree is a root to a binary tree of smaller size, or
            a node without descendants (leaf);
            The traversal algorithm exploits the structural definition of binary trees and
            can easily be implemented recursively;
            Because a recursive method operates by calling a function from within the
            function itself (left/right subtrees) and needs a termination condition
            (leaf node);                                                                     [4 marks]

19.   (a)   Data that can be represented by a continuous function;                            [1 mark]

      (b)   Conversion is necessary before transmission;
            Because a network is used to transmit further digital data to a control centre
            (computerized centre);
            Data in digital form can only be stored/processed by the computer;               [2 marks]

      (c)   Award up to [4 marks max].
            Polling allows the centre to better use its processing resources;
            And to perform more significative data collection, with respect to the
            subsequent analysis;
            For example, the centre can decide to poll the devices;
            In times of lower use of its processing units;
            Or in specific times when the quality of the air is known to be worse;           [4 marks]

      (d)   Award up to [3 marks max].
            (RAM insufficient to store data, data are in disk)
            Use sort-merge strategy/external sort to sort data in disk;
            Portions of data are sorted and stored in temporary files;
            Temporary files are merged afterwards;                                           [3 marks]
