Microeconomics

1.   (a)     Distinguish between decreasing returns to scale and the law of diminishing
             returns.                                                                       [10 marks]

             Answers may include:
                 definitions of decreasing returns to scale and the law of diminishing
               returns
                 theory of costs, particularly short run and long run, with reference to
               fixed and variable costs
                 diagrams to show a long run average total costs curve with increasing,
               constant and decreasing returns to scale, and diminishing returns to one
               factor of production in the short run
                 examples such as agricultural labour or natural monopoly.

             Allow access to Level 3 for students who can explain either one clearly.

(b)   Using diagrams, compare and contrast the market structure of monopoly
      with that of perfect competition.                                                   [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
          definitions of monopoly, perfect competition
          theory of the firm, how both monopoly and perfect competition have
        their advantages and disadvantages in terms of efficiency, price and output

        perfect competition
          examples of natural monopolies, agricultural markets
          synthesis and evaluation (compare and contrast).

      Factors considered may include: the effects on efficiency, welfare effects, price
      and output, research and development and economies of scale. Points of
      comparison could be that they both profit maximise and can both make
      abnormal profits in the short run. Candidates may obtain level 3 where they
      have discussed the two market structures in terms of their respective
      advantages and disadvantages. Level 4 is for those who compare and contrast.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.

(b)   Discuss why, in contrast to the monetarist/new classical model,

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
          definitions of monetarist/new classical model, deflationary (recessionary)
        gap, Keynesian model
          theory of why deflationary (recessionary) gaps can persist according to
        the Keynesian model whereas they cannot in the monetarist/new classical
        model
          diagrams to show monetarist model and Keynesian model
          examples such as Japan in the 1990s
          synthesis and evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the Keynesian argument that deflationary
      (recessionary) gaps persist because of the inability of wages and prices to fall
      and the Keynesian assumption that the AS curve has a long, horizontal section
      meaning that equilibrium GDP is lower than potential GDP. In the monetarist
      model, wages and prices are assumed to be flexible, allowing markets to clear
      thus maintaining full employment of resources.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.

             economic growth
               examples of labour market reforms, both interventionist and
             market-oriented, such as reducing unemployment benefits, reducing the
             power of labour unions and abolishing minimum wages, expenditure on
             education and training, introduction of minimum wages to increase
             participation rates, to increase consumption and promote economic growth.

  1 There is little understanding of the specific demands of the question.

    There are some errors.                                                        4–6

  3 There is understanding of the specific demands of the question.
    Relevant economic terms are defined.
    Relevant economic theory is explained and applied.
    Where appropriate, diagrams are included and applied.

(b)   “Market-oriented supply-side policies will always be more effective in
      promoting economic growth than demand-side policies.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?                                                 [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
          definitions of market-oriented policies (as against interventionist
        policies), demand-side policies and economic growth
          theory of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply and how either may
        be used to increase real GDP
          diagrams to show increased real GDP resulting from changes to AD and
        AS
          examples of market-oriented supply-side policies and demand-side
        policies
          synthesis and evaluation (to what extent).

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: discussion of the
      term effectiveness in the context of economics. Candidates may distinguish the
      effectiveness of each policy in the short run and the long run.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
