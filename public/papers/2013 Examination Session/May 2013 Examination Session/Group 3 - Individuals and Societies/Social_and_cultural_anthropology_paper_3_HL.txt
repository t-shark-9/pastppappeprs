Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools of
thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations.
Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Contrast the approach of a conflict-centred anthropologist with the approach of a cohesion-centred
      anthropologist.


2.    Discuss how one theoretical perspective and theory/school of thought helps to better understand
      a contemporary social issue.


3.    Discuss a diachronic perspective with reference to one of the following:

      • societies and cultures in contact
      • political organization
      • belief systems and practices.


4.    Compare how two of the following schools of thought have informed ethnography:

      • structural functionalism
      • postmodernism
      • structuralism.


5.    Evaluate the importance of one or more of the following in the work of one ethnographer:

      • agency-centred perspective
      • idealist perspective
      • materialist perspective.
