Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain why the price elasticity of demand for primary commodities tends
           to be relatively low while the price elasticity of demand for manufactured
           products tends to be relatively high.                                             [10 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of price elasticity of demand, primary commodities and
             manufactured products
           • application of theory of price elasticity of demand to primary commodities
             and manufactured products, explaining high and low PED, including
             reference to factors that determine the price elasticity of demand of primary
             products and of manufactured goods, eg, degree of necessity, availability of
             substitutes
           • diagrams to show the different degrees of price elasticity of demand
           • examples of primary commodities and manufactured products to which this
             might be, or has been, applied.

(b)   “The income elasticity of demand for primary products tends to be
      lower than that for manufactured products and services.” Examine the
      implications of this for producers and for the economy as a whole.                [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of income elasticity of demand, primary products and
        manufactured products/services; explanation of low YED

        explanation

      Examination may include: a consideration of the different implications for
      producers in terms of the rate of expansion of industries and hence future
      profitability; the implications for resource allocation; the implications for
      relative growth rates of the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of the
      economy; the different effects for ELDCs and EMDCs; an evaluation of the
      significance of income elasticity of demand for firms and the economy as a
      whole.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate examples.

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of labour market reforms, economic growth
           • explanation of how making labour markets more flexible may lead to an
             increase in efficiency and economic growth

             economic growth
           • examples of labour market reforms, both interventionist and
             market-oriented, such as reducing unemployment benefits, reducing the
             power of labour unions and abolishing minimum wages, expenditure on

  1 There is little understanding of the specific demands of the question.

    There is very little knowledge of relevant economic theory.
    There are significant errors.                                                  1–3

  2 There is some understanding of the specific demands of the question.

    There is some knowledge of relevant economic theory.
    There are some errors.                                                         4–6

  3 There is understanding of the specific demands of the question.
    Relevant economic terms are defined.
    Relevant economic theory is explained and applied.
    Where appropriate, diagrams are included and applied.
    Where appropriate, examples are used.
    There are few errors.                                                          7–8

  4 There is clear understanding of the specific demands of the question.

(b)   “Market-oriented supply-side policies will always be more effective in
      promoting economic growth than demand-side policies.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?                                                  [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of market-oriented policies (as against interventionist policies),
        demand-side policies and economic growth
      • theory of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply and how either may be
        used to increase real GDP
      • diagrams to show increased real GDP resulting from changes to AD and AS
      • examples of market-oriented supply side policies and demand-side policies
      • synthesis and evaluation (to what extent).

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: discussion of the
      term effectiveness in the context of economics. Candidates may distinguish the
      effectiveness of each policy in the short run and the long run.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
