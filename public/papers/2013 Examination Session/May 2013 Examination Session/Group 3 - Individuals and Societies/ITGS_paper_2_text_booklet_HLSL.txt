                                           Theme: Education and training

      IT system: using cloud computing services, synchronization of information between portable
      systems, desktop systems, servers and web-based services

      Shannon Academy, a small school in remote south-west Ireland, has become the first school in the
      local area to require students to use cloud computing services for storing, accessing and sharing files.

      The students share files for collaborative projects and teachers can access these files to give advice
      or award marks. Many students are already using cloud computing amongst themselves to share
      resources and to ask for advice and help.

      Cleo O’Byrne, network manager at Shannon Academy, says cloud computing provides many
      technical and educational benefits for the school, teachers and students. For example, the school does
      not need to:
       recruit as many highly qualified technical staff to maintain the school IT systems
       continually purchase and update software because most software is freely available online and
         runs via a browser
       continually purchase additional hardware such as storage devices
       perform back-ups.

      However, cloud computing requires students to have constant internet access.

      Ms O’Byrne said that some applications the students can use are Google Docs and Dropbox which
      provide facilities for storage and sharing of digital content.

      Students can access their Google Docs files in the school computer lab, at home or in an internet cafe
      by logging on to Google and choosing “Documents”.

      If a student chooses to use Google Docs “Share” they can allow another person to access a file and
      add information if they are collaborating on a project. This is done by entering a person’s email
      address into the list of people with permission to access the file (see diagram 1).

      The diagram below shows part of the step-by-step process for storing files, setting access permissions
      and sharing files using Google Docs.

      Ms O’Byrne has also suggested that students can use services such as Dropbox which allows digital
      content to be automatically synchronized across a number of devices.

      Unlike Google Docs, the student will need to download software which sets up a folder called Dropbox
      on their desktop computer or mobile device (see diagram 2).

      The diagrams below show part of the step-by-step process for storing, synchronizing and sharing files
      using Dropbox.

      Files and folders intended for storage in the cloud are stored (drag and drop) in the local Dropbox
      folder (see diagram 3).

      Any changes (additions, deletions) to the local Dropbox folder will be automatically synchronized
      to the Dropbox in the cloud and all the other devices synchronized with that Dropbox account.
      Students can complete homework then drag the file to their Dropbox folder.

      In a school computer laboratory or in an internet cafe, students can access their Dropbox files by
      logging on to the Dropbox. Changes made to their folders in the cloud during lessons will be
      synchronized with their desktop or mobile device Dropbox folders at home.

      When students want to “Share” a folder, they can enter a person’s email address and this will allow
      that person to access that specific folder and also add files to it (see diagram 4).

      Ms O’Byrne also said, “Many students have become frequent users of the free collaborative online
      tools that are based in the cloud, but we may need to issue warnings and introduce specific policies
      about how they use them since there have been some problems occurring.”

      She added, “Also since the problems appeared the school is considering forming a closer relationship
      with a cloud service provider. I think with any cloud computing service to get the best result it is
      important that the provider build a trusted relationship with those people using the service.”
