                      plus one of the following:
                      • in terms of a foreign currency
                      • in a floating exchange rate system.

(b)   Using a diagram, explain how the “increase in foreign investment in
      the Philippine stock market” has affected the value of the Philippine
      peso (paragraph ).                                                   [4 marks]

      Level                                                                                  Marks

        1 There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                         1–2
          For drawing an accurate, labelled demand and supply diagram for the peso
          with the demand curve for the peso shifting to the right leading to a higher
          exchange rate or for an explanation that increased foreign investment means
          that there will have been an increase in demand for the peso and this has
          caused an increase in the value of the peso.

        2 There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                        3–4
          For drawing an accurate, labelled demand and supply diagram for the peso
          with the demand curve for the peso shifting to the right leading to a higher
          exchange rate and for an explanation that increased foreign investment
          means that there will have been an increase in demand for the peso and this
          has caused an increase in the value of the peso.

      An alternative approach would be to illustrate a market for the US$ against the
      peso, showing an increase in supply of the US$, resulting in a fall in the value of
      the dollar against the peso. If drawn correctly and accompanied by a correct
      explanation that this means that there is an increase in the value of the peso, then
      this may be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks]. For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate,
      price of peso in US$, USD/peso, dollars per peso. The horizontal axis should be
      quantity, or quantity of pesos. A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain how the Philippine peso remittances affect
      the national output of the Philippine economy.                             [4 marks]

        1 There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                        1–2
          For drawing an accurate, labelled AD/AS diagram showing an increase in
          AD/movement to the right of the AD curve or an explanation that the
          remittances sent to the Philippines have the effect of increasing
          consumption (or investment) leading to an increase in AD and therefore
          leading to an increase in national output.

        2 There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                       3–4
          For drawing an accurate, labelled AD/AS diagram showing an increase in
          AD/movement to the right of the AD curve and an explanation that the
          remittances sent to the Philippines have the effect of increasing
          consumption (or investment) leading to an increase in AD and therefore
          leading to an increase in national output.

      An alternative approach would be to illustrate an increase in the long run
      aggregate supply with the explanation that remittances used to finance
      construction will increase capital in the economy and therefore lead to an increase
      in the LRAS. If this is correctly illustrated and explained, full marks may be
      awarded.

      Given the information in the text, candidates may explain the effect of a fall in
      remittances on the national output. If correctly illustrated and explained, this
      approach may be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks]. For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level,
      or general price level. The horizontal axis may be real output, national output,
      real national output, national income (Y), or GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations
      such as APL, GPL, RNO, or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

          There is basic knowledge/understanding.

        2 Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.                3–5
          There is clear knowledge/understanding.
          There is some attempt at application/analysis.

        3 Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.                6–8
          There is clear knowledge/understanding.
          There is some effective application/analysis.
          There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and evidence.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include
      • identification of measures of performance, ie employment, stable prices,
        growth, current account balance
      • appreciation results in a fall in the price of imported factors of production and
        will reduce inflationary pressure (increase SRAS)
      • domestic producers will be forced to become more efficient as appreciation
        means that their products are less competitive in international markets and as
        imported goods become less expensive
      • the effect of the appreciation on the current account and AD depends on the
        elasticities of demand for exports and imports, but the president is worried
        about the export sector (paragraph )
      • domestic producers may have to lay off workers in order to cut costs, resulting
        in more unemployment
      • The effect of the appreciation on the amount of remittances is unclear. It may
        reduce amount of remittances and thus slow down consumption and
        construction; or, as expected, Filipinos abroad may continue to absorb the
        losses themselves (paragraph ¹).
      • Some Filipinos working overseas may return to the Philippines if the value of
        their remittances is not worth them working away from home. This may result
        in increased unemployment in the Philippines and lower disposable incomes
        for those reliant on remittances (paragraph ).

• Some high-skilled Filipinos may return the Philippines if the value of their
  remittance is not worth them working away from home. This will result in a
  more highly-skilled labour force in the Philippines, and a possible shift in the
  LRAS.

Any reasonable discussion that makes supported judgments/conclusions
concerning the possible effects on Philippine economic performance.

        1 There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                         1–2
          For drawing an accurately labelled diagram of a tariff being imposed on
          Malaysian palm oil in the Indian palm oil market indicating a fall in the
          level of imports or for explaining that Indian tariffs on Malaysian palm oil
          will cause a reduction in the amount of exports that Malaysian palm oil
          producers will be able to sell to India.

        2 There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                        3–4
          For drawing an accurately labelled diagram of a tariff being imposed on
          Malaysian palm oil in the Indian palm oil market indicating a fall in the
          level of imports and for explaining that Indian tariffs on Malaysian palm oil
          will cause a reduction in the amount of exports that Malaysian palm oil
          producers will be able to sell to India.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks]. The use of Price and Quantity for the axes is sufficient. The domestic
      supply curve should be labelled as “S domestic” or (SD) and the Malaysian supply
      can be labelled “S Malaysia”, “SM”, “SWorld” or “SW”.

          For an understanding that these are all types of economic integration
          (or trade bloc) but that there is a different level of integration in each type.

        2 The written response is accurate.                                                   3–4
          For explaining that the extent of integration increases, with reference to any
          two correct differences between the highest level of integration, common
          market, and the lowest level of integration, free trade area.

           Key differences include:
           • no common external tariff at lowest level
           • common external tariff in customs union
           • free movement of factors of production at highest level
           • common policies on product regulation at highest level.

      An alternative approach would be to define the three types of integration. If the
      definitions are correct, the answer may be fully rewarded as the distinctions
      between the levels will be implicit.

      • greater choice and lower prices for consumers
      • lower prices may reduce costs of production
      • better use of comparative advantage
      • increased output for Malaysia and India
      • greater competition should lead to increased efficiency
      • possibility of economies of scale
      • increased investment linked to the agreement (paragraph ) which may
         increase employment
      • removal of technical barriers makes trade easier
      • possible that tariffs will fall on Malaysia’s exports of electrical and electronic
         products, crude petroleum, palm oil and chemical goods, creating employment
         in these sectors (paragraph )
      • the possibility for both countries to diversify exports as the agreement will be
         more extensive than the existing agreement with ASEAN (paragraph )
      • less dependence on China and the US (paragraph ).

Limitations:
• domestic producers may have to close down if they are not competitive
• dependency on trade within the area may be restrictive
• increased unemployment if firms that cannot compete are forced to reduce their
  size or close down
• possibility of trade diversion
• possible adverse effects on world trade of the appearance of regional trading
   blocs, compared with the multilateral agreements favoured by WTO
• structural unemployment that may result as production in the economy changes
  in response to freer trade
• may limit the ability of each country to support infant industries and gain
  comparative advantage in new areas.

Any reasonable evaluation of the relative strengths and limitations of the trade
agreement.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations.

      Responses may include:
      • a definition of economic development.

      Strengths of micro-credit:
      • micro-credit provides a means of escaping the poverty trap (paragraph )
      • micro-credit given to women allows them to improve their physical and social
         well-being, and gives them the opportunity to raise the standards of living for
         their children
      • increased employment opportunities
      • micro-credit gives access to people are unable to obtain loans from financial
         institutions as a result of having no security to offer
      • micro-credit allows people to obtain a loan at a lower rate than if they
         borrowed from “loan sharks”
      • micro-credit fosters self-reliance and the use of entrepreneurial skills through
         self-employment
      • micro-credit is often accompanied by provision of basic skills that enable the
         borrowers to make better use of the loans
      • micro-credit gives borrowers the opportunity to earn more income from their
         land (paragraphs  and )
      • China’s state banks are now also trying to offer more access to micro-credit
         (paragraph ).

Limitations:
• micro-credit may cause the government to feel that it no longer needs to invest
  in poverty-reducing programmes
• there may be insufficient regulation of the growing informal sector, resulting in
  new avenues for “loan sharks” to take advantage of impoverished borrowers.
• Many people who take micro-credit loans are not natural entrepreneurs and do
  not have appropriate business experience. This makes it quite possible that
  they will be unable to pay back the loans.
• businesses started with micro-credit loans are likely to remain small; while
  they might help individual borrowers out of poverty, this might not make a
  significant dent in overall poverty
• no guarantee that the use of micro-credit will lift citizens in rural China above
  the poverty line (paragraph )
• many remote areas remain inaccessible so it is unlikely that micro-credit will
  be able to be used (paragraph ).

Any reasonable evaluation that assesses the relative strengths and limitations of
micro-credit in contributing to economic development.

          and that the HDI is a more valid measure since it is a composite indicator
          that includes literacy, life expectancy and GNI per capita which are
          indicators for health, education and income, all of which are important for
          economic development.

(d) Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
    discuss the possible effects on the economic development of Cambodia of
    investment from China and the United States (US).                       [8 marks]

          There is clear knowledge/understanding.
          There is some attempt at application/analysis.

        3 Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.             6–8
          There is clear knowledge/understanding.
          There is some effective application/analysis.
          There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and evidence.

      Command term

Responses may include:
• a definition of economic development
• a definition of investment
• a reference to the table noting that there has been economic development in
  Cambodia since 1990 but that Cambodia’s level of development remains low.

Possible positive effects:
• fill the savings gap
• break the poverty cycle
• increased/improved infrastructure (paragraph ) and the impact of
  infrastructure on economic development
• increased opportunities for employment, increasing income and raising
  standards of living
• improved technical and management skills and improved human capital
  (may be considered a positive externality of production)
• improvements in technology
• increase in tax revenue for the Cambodian government which may be used to
  achieve development objectives
• multiplier effect
• trust shown by US and China encourages investment from other countries
• exports which result from foreign investment may improve the trade balance
  and therefore the Cambodian current account
• increased economic growth may raise living standards and allow for greater
  access to health care and education
• The desire of the US to invest in Cambodia may be encouraging the US
  government to cooperate on debt negotiations. Debt relief will free up money
  for investment in environmental areas or education which are key for economic
  development (paragraph ).

Possible negative effects:
• negative externalities – loss of water quality and a loss of biodiversity
  (paragraph )
• the motives for investment may not be consistent with Cambodia’s best
  interests
• the infrastructure provided by Chinese and US investments may be tailored to
  their own needs rather than Cambodian needs
• the possibility of a loss of sovereignty for the Cambodian government to make
  decisions that are in the interests of the Cambodian people
• the benefits of foreign investment and economic growth may be distributed
  unequally amongst the Cambodian people, worsening income inequality
• capital intensive technology might not be appropriate, employing relatively few
  people and having little impact on domestic employment
• vulnerability if there is an outflow of foreign investment.

Any reasonable discussion of the ways that foreign investment might or might not
contribute to economic development.
