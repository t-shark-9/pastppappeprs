Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain how welfare loss may result from monopoly power.                          [10 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of welfare loss, monopoly power, allocative efficiency market
             failure
           • theory of the firm: monopoly market structure explaining how price is
             higher and output lower due to barriers to entry, allowing loss of productive
             and allocative efficiency at profit maximising output
           • diagram to show the above, highlighting welfare (deadweight) loss under
             monopoly
           • examples of welfare loss under monopoly.

(b)   Discuss the effectiveness of government policies (legislation and
      regulation) to reduce monopoly power.                                             [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of monopoly power and legislation (anti-monopoly,
        anti-collusion, merger prevention etc.) and regulation (lower prices and
        larger quantities for consumers, fair prices for natural monopolies)
      • theory of how a monopolist’s control of price or output might be reduced by
        legislation or regulation in the interests of the consumer
      • diagram to show a comparison of monopoly and perfect competition;
        diagram to illustrate price regulation showing monopoly charging a price
        which is equal to average cost
      • examples of legislation, regulation, and also other solutions such as
        nationalization, privatization and trade liberalization
      • synthesis and evaluation (discuss).

      Discussions may include: effectiveness of policies against the sources of
      monopoly power, eg reduction of legal barriers to entry, control of
      anti-competitive behaviour. Where natural monopoly occurs, restrictive
      policies might not be in the consumer’s interest. Government policies might
      be rendered less effective by globalization. Government policies might move
      a market from monopoly towards a market structure which gives rise to
      allocative efficiency.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.

           affected by the price elasticity of demand.                                       [10 marks]

           • definitions of an indirect tax, price elasticity of demand, incidence
             of taxation
           • theory of how relative price elasticities influence the proportionate sharing
             of an indirect tax burden between producers and consumers
           • diagrams to show incidence of an indirect tax on consumers and producers
             for goods with elastic and inelastic demand curves, showing that the more
             elastic the demand, the greater the incidence on the producer, and vice versa
           • examples of goods with differing price elasticities of demand and the
             resulting differences in their incidence of taxation.

(b)   To what extent might the problems of negative externalities of
      consumption be resolved by the use of indirect taxation?                            [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of negative externalities of consumption, indirect taxation
      • theory of externalities with its implications for overconsumption/
        under-pricing and the opportunity to attempt to correct misleading market
        signals through an indirect tax
      • diagrams to show a negative externality of consumption being abated by the
        use of indirect taxation
      • examples of (demerit) goods, with negative externalities of consumption,
        which are subject to indirect taxes
      • synthesis and evaluation (to what extent).

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: the difficulty of
      setting indirect taxes at the correct level to reduce the negative externality to
      the social optimum/redress specific damage. Candidates may choose to set this
      response in the context of market failure.

             of minimal intervention by the government may lead to unequal returns

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of equity, efficiency in the allocation of resources
      • theory of how government policies (taxation, government expenditure on
        merit goods and subsidies and transfer payments) may promote equity but
        possibly reduce efficiency in the allocation of resources

        efficiency in the allocation of resources
      • examples of government policies to promote greater income equality in
        particular countries and their effects on the achievement of efficiency
      • synthesis and evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: consideration of the trade off between equity
      and efficiency, and whether transfer payments and progressive taxation
      reduce incentives to work. Government provision of merit goods may be less
      efficient than private provision. The use of indirect taxes and/or subsidies
      may move the economy closer to, or further away from, the position of
      allocative efficiency. Poverty reduction and investment in human capital may
      be consistent with the achievement of both improved income equality
      and efficiency.

      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

             economic growth
           • examples of labour market reforms, both interventionist and
             market-oriented, such as reducing unemployment benefits, reducing the
             power of labour unions and abolishing minimum wages, expenditure on
             education and training, introduction of minimum wages to increase
             participation rates, to increase consumption and promote economic growth.

  1 There is little understanding of the specific demands of the question.

    There are some errors.                                                        4–6

  3 There is understanding of the specific demands of the question.
    Relevant economic terms are defined.
    Relevant economic theory is explained and applied.
    Where appropriate, diagrams are included and applied.
    Where appropriate, examples are used.

(b)   “Market-oriented supply-side policies will always be more effective in
      promoting economic growth than demand-side policies.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?                                                  [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of market-oriented policies (as against interventionist policies),
        demand-side policies and economic growth
      • theory of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply and how either may be
        used to increase real GDP
      • diagrams to show increased real GDP resulting from changes to AD and AS
      • examples of market-oriented supply-side policies and demand-side policies
      • synthesis and evaluation (to what extent).

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: discussion of the
      term effectiveness in the context of economics. Candidates may distinguish the
      effectiveness of each policy in the short run and the long run.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
