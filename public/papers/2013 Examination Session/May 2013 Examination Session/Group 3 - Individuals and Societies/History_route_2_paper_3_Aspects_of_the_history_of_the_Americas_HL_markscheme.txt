Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
         structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
         insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
         than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8: The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present,
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

Independence movements

1.   To what extent was hostility between Spain and Britain the main cause for at least one war of
     independence in the Americas?

     Candidates may take different positions on the relative importance of antagonism/hostility between
     Spain and Britain, in comparison to other factors, as the main cause for wars of independence in the
     Americas. Examiners should remain open to alternative positions that are well-supported with
     knowledge and analysis. Any wars of independence in the Americas should be accepted. If
     candidates discuss multiple wars of independence make allowance for less depth of coverage.

     Candidates in agreement will probably emphasize the following as causes of hostility: impact of the
     Spanish colonial monopoly on English overseas expansion and Britain’s desire to advance
     economic interests in the Americas; formal restrictions and legal impediments, imposed by Spain,
     that hindered the ability of Britain to invest in different areas and activities in the Americas; rivalry
     over the expansion of commerce between the local elites in Spanish and Portuguese colonies and
     British representatives; Spanish resentment over Creole elites having been inspired by ideas of
     freedom and autonomy from British Enlightenment philosophers; the impact of the British
     Navigation acts.

     Candidates in disagreement will probably focus on: sentiments of independence which had already
     developed in many Latin American colonies as a result of their own evolution and treatment by
     European colonizer; Bourbon reforms caused tension and dissatisfaction among local communities
     in Latin America and royal attempts to improve administrative efficiency in their colonies was only
     partially successful; new perspectives among the younger members of the colonial population
     resulted from both the Enlightenment and changes caused by the high cost of European wars;
     Britain and Spain were allies during the period of 1808–1814 in order to expel Napoleon and his
     family from Spain; Spanish empire weakness as a result of the Napoleonic invasion.

2.   Compare and contrast the contribution of two of the following leaders to the process of
     independence in the Americas: Adams; Jefferson; San Martín; Bolivar.

     Adams
     From 1775–1776, Adams published a number of political essays in which he contended that
     Parliament had no authority to tax or regulate the colonies; he was an opponent of the Stamp Act;
     offered a plan for a representative government with a bicameral assembly as well as independent
     executive and judicial branches; represented Massachusetts in the second Continental Congress,
     was one of the strongest advocates of independence and was appointed to the committee to write the
     Declaration of Independence; was principal in writing the treaty of peace (Peace of Paris) with
     England; became the second President of the United States.

     Jefferson
     Jefferson published “A Summary View of the Rights of British America”, an essay criticizing the
     English monarchy as a form of government; supported “natural rights theory”, claiming government
     allegiance to the King was voluntary; was a member of the committee appointed by the second
     Continental Congress to frame the justification of independence and was the principal author of the
     Declaration of Independence, adopted in 1776; his statement as to the “inalienable rights of life,
     liberty and the pursuit of happiness” would become the principal expression of the American mind
     and influence other independence movements in the Americas; became the third President of the
     United States.

     San Martín
     San Martín was educated in Spain where he became acquainted with the ideas of the Enlightenment
     with special reference to individual rights and the autonomy of nations, though he remained a
     moderate monarchist. In the Americas, he participated as a member of the Logia Lautaro, sharing
     Enlightenment ideas and their implications for the revolutionary movements that had already begun;
     conceived the idea of the revolutionary militia as a continental force in Chile and Peru; accepted a
     wide variety of societal members into the revolutionary militia; became the revolutionary authority
     of Peru and thus helped consolidate the success of the wars for independence in Latin America.

     Bolivar
     Bolivar spent part of his youth in Europe, where he learned the ideas of the Enlightenment; from a
     wealthy, aristocratic Caracas family, which allowed him to gain the support of the Creole elite in
     Venezuela; defended republican and authoritarian principles in the emerging Latin American
     nations; in order to achieve his aims, he marched his troops from Venezuela towards the south
     through Colombia, Ecuador and Peru; believed that all groups in society should participate in the
     independence movement, thus enjoying popular support, including that of the indigenous
     community. However, candidates may distinguish between different stages in his political thinking.
     At first he was less inclined to favour popular participation out of the fear of slave revolts.

     For “compare”
     Depending on choices, candidates may find similarity in the influences of Enlightenment
     philosophy; reaction to colonial mismanagement; concepts of republicanism, etc.

     For “contrast”
     Depending on choices, candidates may emphasize differences in the societal structure; political
     experience; nature of the conflict; military versus political leadership; elected versus non-elected
     positions, etc.

     Reward candidates who support their analysis with relevant knowledge.

     If only compare or contrast is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

Nation-building and challenges

3.   How important was the Durham Report (1839) in the struggle by Canadians to achieve
     responsible government?

     This is not a question about the causes of the 1837 Rebellions in what was then known as
     “The Canadas”. Reward candidates who situate the Durham Report in the context of these
     rebellions, though the causes of those rebellions should not become the focus of the candidate’s
     answer. Students should know the three-pronged content of the Durham Report, in particular its
     suggestions about “responsible government” (eg appointment of executive branch and cabinet
     ministers, support for bills, 5 year elections etc). Candidates could place these in the context of the
     previous “system of government”: the “Family Compact” (Upper Canada) and the Chateau Clique
     (Lower Canada).

     Stronger candidates should refer to the role of other factors in the struggle to realize “responsible
     government” (eg the development of economic liberalism (free trade); the political success in
     Britain of the Reformers; the repeal of the Corn Laws; the actions of numerous Governor Generals,
     the Colonial Reformers and specific political actions by Robert Baldwin and Louis La Fontaine,
     etc). Higher marks will be achieved by those candidates who weigh the importance of the
     contribution of the Durham Report alongside the relative importance of the respective contributions
     of all the factors mentioned by the candidate.

     Allow candidates to challenge, or define in a more specific sense, the terms “Canadians” and
     “responsible government” in considering arguments such as, for example, that Durham’s
     conception of “responsible government” was founded on a relatively biased attitude towards the
     “self-government” of French Canadians.

4.   Analyse the effects of the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) on any two countries of
     the region.

     The most obvious countries are the United States and Mexico. The most obvious consequence of
     the war was the geo-political transformation which occurred under the terms of the Treaty of
     Guadalupe Hidalgo which was approved by the US Senate on 10 March 1848, and ratified by the
     Mexican Congress on 25 May 1848.

     United States
     Geo-political consequences
     In the Mexican Cession, the Mexican territories of Alta California and Santa Fé de Nuevo México
     were ceded to the United States; 1.2 million square miles (3.1 million km²) of territory added to the
     United States; Mexico recognized US sovereignty over all of Texas north of the Rio Grande; the
     Gadsden Purchase in 1853.

     Political consequences
     (Particularly in terms of the debate over expansion of slave territory in the United States); quarrels
     in the United States regarding the disposition of conquered Mexico; a strong “All-Mexico”
     movement urged annexation of the entire territory; abolitionists opposed that position and fought
     for the exclusion of slavery from any territory absorbed by the United States; the 1847 Wilmot
     Proviso; the 1850 Compromises.

     Social consequences
     Surge of patriotism, belief in “Manifest Destiny”; it helped train officers who later became the
     military leaders on both sides of the Civil War.

     Mexico
     Geo-political consequences
     Mexico lost 55 % of its national territory; the Rio Grande River became the boundary between
     Texas and Mexico, and Mexico never again claimed ownership of Texas.

     Political consequences
     Government tried to colonize its remaining northern territories as a hedge against further losses.
     Santa Anna was removed from power. The treaty had the effect of destabilizing Mexico for
     decades.

     Financial consequences
     United States agreed to pay $15 million. Mexico’s potential for growth and development was
     forever limited by the loss of territory.

     Social consequences
     Vast majority of Mexicans remained in the United States though they faced substantial
     discrimination; relocation of some Mexicans further south in Mexico; Latin American fears of
     further US expansion.

     Do not expect all of the above, and allow for some imbalance in terms of more consideration of one
     country than another.

     If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

United States Civil War: causes, course and effects 1840–1877

5.   In what ways, and to what extent, did the events of the 1850s contribute to the increase of
     sectionalism and the outbreak of the United States Civil War?

     Sectionalism between the Northern and Southern sections in the United States had roots within the
     economic and social differences that evolved from the colonial period through the early 1800s.
     However, the decade of the 1850s exhibited a series of crisis events that greatly escalated tensions
     between the two regions and which contributed to a political and social climate that limited the
     potential for compromise. The result was Southern secession upon Lincoln’s election in 1860.

      1850 Compromise – This legislation emerged from the acquisition of territory acquired in the
       Mexican–American War and the question of “free” or “slave” status for the territories and
       potential states. California was admitted as a free state and popular sovereignty was applied to
       New Mexico and Utah territories. It negated the long-standing Missouri Compromise (1820)
       that had maintained an uneasy political peace between the North and South. Particularly volatile
       was the inclusion of a new fugitive slave law that required Northern officials to assist in the
       capture and return of runaway slaves. The attempt of many Northern areas to nullify this clause
       through “personal liberty laws” led to the growth of the Underground Railroad, causing
       resentment in the South;
      Publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852) – The publication of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s novel
       portrayed the inhumane conditions of slavery, leading to the growth of abolitionists in the North
       and a vocal defence of slavery in the South;
      Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854) – The application of popular sovereignty to determine the “free” or
       “slave” status of Kansas led to “bleeding Kansas”, a lengthy period of lawlessness and violence
       in Kansas Territory that contributed to the emotional polarization of society;
      Dred Scott v Sandford (1857) – The Supreme Court ruled that slaves were not citizens and that
       owners could move slaves into the territories, in spite of Congress’s attempt to restrict this
       action. This enraged abolitionists and “free-soil” elements who had hoped to stop the expansion
       of slavery. It also caused the South to retain hope for the expansion of slavery in the territories;
      John Brown’s Raid (1859) – John Brown’s attempted take-over of the federal arsenal at Harper’s
       Ferry, Virginia, was for the purpose of initiating a slave rebellion that would spread throughout
       the South. His actions caused Southerners to perceive the North as increasingly radical in the
       support of extreme abolitionism and his capture and execution resulted in many Northerners
       viewing him as a martyr.

     Accept other events of the 1850s that could be considered as representing or contributing to the
     growth of sectionalism.

     Do not expect all of the above, but candidates should be specific in their analysis as to how each of
     the covered events led to more extreme sectionalism and the possibility of disunion.

6.   Why, and with what results, was there political opposition to the plans for Reconstruction in
     the United States between 1863 and 1867?

     Why
     Southern politicians opposed the changes sought by the Republicans as too radical and sought to
     limit and obstruct their efforts. Congressional Republicans, both moderates and radicals, had a
     variety of motives, which ranged from idealistic, to political and economic.

      The attempt by Congress to restore its power over domestic affairs after the civil war;
      The attempt by Southern states to limit post-war reform by the passage of “black codes”, the
       election of ex-Confederates to Congress, implementation of contract-labour laws and the
       restriction of civil liberties for freedmen. This caused resentment by those who believed the
       Union victory must be accompanied by significant social reform;
      President Andrew Johnson’s veto of expanded funding for the Freedman’s Bureau and a civil
       rights bill for freedmen along with his campaign against Radical Republicans in the 1866
       Congressional elections was seen as attempting to prevent reform;
      Concern that, with the elimination of the 3/5 compromise from the Constitution, the South would
       increase its representation in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College thus
       threatening the North for political supremacy;
      Altruistic desire for significant reform by some members of the Radical Republicans, (ie Charles
       Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens);
      Desire for economic dominance by the North, in its relationship with the South.

     Results
     President Lincoln’s plan was introduced in December of 1863 and asserted executive branch
     authority over the reconstruction process. States would be “re-admitted” once 10 % of the voters of
     a state took a “loyalty oath” and accepted the emancipation of slaves. Congress first asserted its
     intentions by passage of the Wade–Davis bill in 1864, which the President pocket-vetoed. President
     Andrew Johnson modified the plan to disenfranchise more Southern aristocrats. He kept most of
     the other lenient elements.

      Republicans overrode Johnson’s veto to restore funding of the Freedman’s Bureau and gain
       passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, declaring African Americans citizens and attempting to
       shield them from the “black codes”;
      Congress passed, in 1866, the 14th Amendment to federally enforce African American citizenship
       and provide “equal-protection” and “due-process” guarantees. States would also have their
       proportional representation reduced if African American voting rights were denied;
      In 1867 Congress took full control and applied “Military Reconstruction” which divided the
       South into five military districts and required seceded states to ratify the 14th and 15th (universal
       male suffrage) Amendments in order to be restored to the Union. The army commanders of the
       five districts were placed under the control of Congress;
      Congressional Republicans attempted to counter President Andrew Johnson’s authority by
       impeachment, but failed to obtain a 2/3 vote in the Senate, necessary for the President’s removal.

     Do not expect all of the above, but reward answers that address both demands of the question.

     If only “why” or “results” are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

The development of modern nations 1865–1929

7.   Examine the impact of immigration on one country of the region from the late nineteenth
     century to the early twentieth century.

     The broad timescale of the question is 1865–1929. While a small allowance must be made for
     references to movements just either side of these dates, do not accept more recent immigration
     patterns.

     The probable examples could be: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Canada and the United States, but
     any other country will do. Candidates should provide specific examples of immigrant nationalities,
     a clear idea about where they went, what they did and what impact they had on the society.

     Answers will vary according to the selection of the country, but some of the general aspects to be
     discussed might include: rapid industrialization, urbanization, ghettoization; commercial
     development in specific areas (eg the role of Italian and Spanish settlers in Argentina in the
     expansion of the cattle industry and the development of the wheat and shoe industries; in Brazil,
     role of Swiss immigrants in the cheese industries, Italians in the coffee industry; Japanese in the
     cotton industry). Political representation; social tensions; issues of ethnic integration; manual
     labourers/rural workers and established elite; cultural developments may also have relevance.

     Do not expect all of the above and allow others not included in this list.


8.   With reference to at least one country of the region, to what extent were the aims of
     Progressivism achieved by 1929?

     While candidates may focus solely on the United States, any country where Progressivism existed is
     acceptable. Definitions of Progressivism and relevant examples will vary dependent upon the
     country selected.

     Answers could include reference to some of the following: political aims – women’s suffrage, direct
     election of senators, curbing powers of political bosses, democratizing governing institutions;
     economic aims – progressive taxation, economic controls, corporate regulation; social aims –
     prohibition of drugs and alcohol, health and safety legislation.

     Specific measures that could be discussed include: political reforms – women’s suffrage, referenda,
     direct primaries; social reforms – child-labour laws, consumer protection laws, labour laws
     affecting women and workers’ compensation laws.

     Candidates choosing a Latin American country could associate Progressivism with “Order and
     Progress”. Reward answers that assess its achievements and make an evaluation of the attempts at
     reform (eg: the UCR in Argentina; “Batllismo” in Uruguay).

Emergence of the Americas in global affairs 1880–1929

9.   “The United States’ policies of the Big Stick and Moral Diplomacy in Latin America had
     different motives but similar consequences.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     Motives
      President T Roosevelt was an open advocate of imperialism and asserted the Roosevelt Corollary
       to the Monroe Doctrine, which sought to justify US intervention. President Wilson was initially
       a critic of imperialism and offered no policy statement in its support (even though he engaged in
       frequent interventions);
      Roosevelt and Wilson were similar in that both claimed altruistic motives, Roosevelt to protect
       Latin American republics from the debt-collecting and possible control by European powers and
       Wilson to support “moral diplomacy” and democratic principles and institutions;
      Both proclaimed “morality” as a basis to justify their actions, Roosevelt cited alleged “chronic
       wrong-doing” by Latin American countries as the necessity for debt-collecting interventions and
       Wilson withheld recognition of regimes that did not meet US proclaimed “standards of
       morality”.

     Consequences
      Both engaged in multiple military interventions in Latin American nations. Roosevelt intervened
       in: Colombia’s province of Panama to secure canal rights (1903); Dominican Republic debt
       collecting (1905); Cuba under the Platt Amendment (1906). Wilson intervened through: the
       blockade and occupation of Vera Cruz (1914); the protection of US lives, property and financial
       interests in Haiti and Dominican Republic (1915 and 1916, respectively); General Pershing’s
       invasion of Mexico in pursuit of Pancho Villa (1916);
      The actions of both Roosevelt and Wilson contributed substantially to the growth of
       anti-American sentiment due to violations of the sovereign rights of Latin American nations;
      Roosevelt’s interventions led to the acquisition of territory in the form of the Panama Canal
       Zone. Wilson’s interventions did not lead to further acquisitions (though he did purchase the
       Virgin Islands from Denmark).
      Roosevelt’s most significant intervention (to secure canal building rights) resulted in the United
       States receiving preferential treatment in the use of the canal and led to Colombia’s loss of
       territory. Wilson secured the repeal of such advantages and initiated legislation for a $25 million
       indemnity and an apology to Colombia (the apology was blocked by supporters of Roosevelt; the
       indemnity was paid during the Harding administration);
      Roosevelt intervened to establish and support a revolution (Panama to separate from Colombia);
       Wilson intervened to counter Huerta’s revolution and regime in Mexico.

     Do not expect all of the above and remain open to the possibility that candidates may successfully
     challenge the statement.

     If only one policy is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

10.   Evaluate the arguments that took place in the United States over ratification of the Versailles
      Treaty following the First World War.

      Arguments in Support of Ratification
      Many of the arguments in support of ratification were based on the principles of the 14 Points, not
      all of which were fully incorporated into the Versailles Treaty.

       The war costs, in terms of lives and money, must be redeemed by the peaceful resolution of
        future conflicts, which required the establishment of a League of Nations;
       The League would provide an international forum which would serve to resolve the
        controversies and faults that emerged from the passage of the Versailles Treaty;
       The United States was the only nation with the moral authority and altruistic interest to advance
        peace and democracy in the world and therefore must ratify the Versailles Treaty and become a
        member of the League;
       Peace must be achieved without the typical division of spoils or dominance of the vanquished
        that followed the end of war;
       The reduction of armaments would deter war;
       Self-determination principles would aid in the growth of democracy and human freedom;
       The desire of Democrats to support Wilson’s peace initiatives.

      Arguments in Opposition to Ratification
      Of the issues and arguments against, some were based on the elements of the 14 Points. Others
      were based on the actual content of the Versailles Treaty; still others were based on political,
      ideological and social aspects of the post-war period.

       The League of Nations would interfere with US sovereignty (based on Article X);
       The League would constitute an “entangling alliance”, in violation of the traditional values of
        the United States;
       The treaty might cause European nations to interfere in the Western Hemisphere in violation of
        the Monroe Doctrine;
       Wilson’s “October Appeal” (1918), in support of a Congressional Democratic majority, violated
        the spirit of non-partisanship maintained during the war;
       Several key Senators (ie Lodge and Borah) were political and personal rivals of Wilson;
       The post-war growth of disillusionment, based on emerging knowledge as to the realities of First
        World War conditions, and awareness of the desire of the European victors for punishment of the
        defeated nations, caused a desire to withdraw from international commitments;
       “Irreconcilables”, led by LaFollette, were unalterably opposed to the treaty while
        “Reservationists” were willing to accept modifications;
       Wilson’s refusal to accept reservations to the Versailles Treaty.

      Candidates should demonstrate knowledge of the arguments both in support of and in opposition to
      the Versailles Treaty. Accept some imbalance in emphasis based on a candidate’s individual
      knowledge and analysis.

The Mexican Revolution 1910–1940

11.   “The Mexican Constitution of 1917 was more radical in theory than in practice.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      In order to evaluate this statement candidates need to show a detailed knowledge of the content of
      the Mexican Constitution of 1917: how different its provisions were from, or similar to, what went
      on before in Mexico (eg Diaz’s dictatorial political system; haciendas and land distribution; foreign
      influence; influence of the Catholic Church; absence of workers’ rights; great social inequalities), as
      well as a sense of the extent to which its provisions were applied by the ensuing governments of
      Carranza, Obregon, Calles and the Maximato, Cardenas.

      Aspects of the Constitution likely to be discussed could include: the federal system, separation of
      powers, no re-election, provision of individual rights; educational reforms (Article 3); labour
      protection and rights (Article 123); natural resources (soil and subsoil), land reform, and restrictions
      on economic growth (Article 27); restrictions on Church and clergy (Article 130). Arguments for
      the application of its theory might refer to Calles’s educational reforms, land and labour reform;
      Cardenas’s agrarian reform and rights of urban and industrial workers. Arguments for limited
      application could include details about Carranza’s refusal to implement the more radical provisions
      of the document; Calles’s failures to enforce the separation of Church and State in education (the
      War of the Cristeros); his failure to implement Article 27 (subsoil and oil leases). Due to US
      objections, the law was rewritten allowing some concessions to the US, but reaffirming national
      ownership of subsoil; the Constitution did not prevent Calles’s Maximato; Cardenas’s reshaping of
      the political system; etc.

      Do not expect all of the above. Reward well-structured, clearly supported arguments.

12.   Examine the impact of the Mexican Revolution on two of the following: the arts; education;
      music.

      The Arts
      Likely topics might be the muralist movement lead by Diego Rivera, José Orozco and David
      Siqueiros, who were commissioned to paint “revolutionary” frescos on the walls of ministries and
      public buildings depicting revolutionary and indigenous themes or images of the social and political
      situation of post-revolutionary Mexico; Frida Kahlo is also likely to be a popular choice. A main
      theme is the way in which the movement disseminated the notion of legitimizing the Revolution
      among the masses, and served to consolidate a state ideology of common citizenship and
      progressive nationalism.

      Music
      No doubt Corridos such as La Cucaracha, alongside Banda and Pancho Villa’s use of wind
      orchestras will be popular choices. But rather than a simple description of stylistic developments,
      the main emphasis should be placed on the way in which music in Mexico was used for political
      and social commentary, to celebrate, to express and to further the aims and ideals of the revolution.

      Education
      It was a broad “developmentalist” ideology and proved to be exceptionally powerful in the later
      stages of the revolution when it allied to anti-clericalism; the results were poor as education
      improvement was de-emphasized in favour of agrarian reform; some rural schools were established,
      but the general education budget was not dramatically increased; obvious topics might include
      Vasconcelos’ extensive campaigns in education and literacy between 1920 and 1924.

      In addition to the above, other arts, such as literature and dance, are acceptable.

      If only one area of impact is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

The Great Depression and the Americas 1929–1939

13.   With reference to at least one country of the region, to what extent was the Wall Street Crash
      of 1929 a cause of the Great Depression?

      This should be a popular question. Candidates with a more solid knowledge of the topic might
      argue that the Wall Street Crash was only to some extent a cause of the Depression in the United
      States. While the collapse of the stock market in 1929 may have triggered economic turmoil, it
      alone was not responsible for the Great Depression. The Depression throughout the United States
      and the world was the result of a combination of factors that matured in the 1920s. The crash took
      money out of the system and led, via a vicious circle, to the Depression. However, the United
      States actually did weather the crash. Business activity did not begin to decline significantly until
      the mid 1930s. Fewer than 5 % of people in the United States owned stock so most were not
      directly affected. By April 1930 share prices had actually regained a fifth of the losses of the
      previous autumn. The really disastrous fall came in 1931–1932. Allow for candidates who argue
      that the crash was more a symptom than a cause of the Depression. The economic crisis of 1929,
      however, had a profound impact on all of the countries of the region. In Canada, because of its
      close links with the United States, it caused economic upheaval. In Latin America, as measures
      were taken in the United States to balance the economy, the vulnerability of its economy was
      exposed: the area’s foreign markets collapsed and the prices of its raw materials and foodstuffs fell
      much more sharply than those of the manufactured goods it had to import; difficulties in obtaining
      foreign credit/loans; laissez-faire policies initially contributed to deepening the crisis.

      Answers could use any country as an example but the popular choice is likely to be the United
      States. Once candidates have taken a position about the role of the Wall Street stock market in the
      Depression, it is expected that other causes of the Depression would be discussed in order to
      support the argument.


14.   How successfully did any one Latin American country deal with the challenges brought about
      by the Great Depression?

      Candidates are required to identify the problems caused in any one Latin American country by the
      Great Depression and to assess the effectiveness of state policies to curb them. Answers should
      demonstrate detailed knowledge of the challenges and policies and may assess their immediate
      and/or long-term effects. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina will be popular choices, but allow any other
      relevant case study to be used as this is an opportunity for candidates to write about their own
      country.

      Some of the challenges generally encountered as a result of the Great Depression could include: the
      decline of export prices and volumes, changes in the movement of international capital, inflation,
      social problems (land distribution, uneven distribution of income). Policies will often refer to state
      intervention and centralization, industrialization and import substitution. Assessment as to whether
      the policies were effective will vary according to the country of choice. Large countries like
      Argentina, Brazil and Mexico had internal markets of sufficient size to mitigate the effects of the
      decline of international trade. Smaller countries – such as the Central Americas – were simply
      unable to absorb local production. Better answers will probably show an awareness of long-term
      effects, such as the fact that the industrialization policies accentuated social and regional
      inequalities within many countries.

The Second World War and the Americas 1933–1945

15.   Assess the social impact of the Second World War on women and ethnic minorities in any one
      country of the region.

      It is expected that the majority of candidates will address both requirements from the same country.
      However, it is acceptable to approach separately the impact on women in one country and ethnic
      minorities in another. A comparative approach might be developed, but it is not a requirement.

      The United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Chile and Argentina might
      be popular choices although any other case of the region should be accepted. As a general
      statement, the level of involvement in the Second World War was a key factor for its social impact
      on women and minorities.

      Related to the impact on women, candidates will probably highlight: significant incorporation of
      women to the defence industries (especially in the United States and Canada) and workforce in
      general – sometimes covering the same responsibilities that were held by men but still earning
      lower salaries; some improvement in political participation as well as an increase in marriage and
      birth rates. Women also played important roles directly linked to the war front as nurses, assistants
      and members of entertainment groups for the troops.

      Ethnic minorities such as Latin American, Japanese, Germans, African Americans and Native
      Americans could be addressed depending on the country selected and its level of involvement in the
      war.

      The social impact on Latin Americans differed depending on their participation in the armed forces.
      In the United States they were incorporated as soldiers and members of white units. Later on, it
      resulted in the achievement of better social status for them and their families.

      African Americans entered the Second World War still racially segregated and largely limited
      to support roles in the military, as they had been in the First World War. However, in 1941,
      the United States government began to establish a limited number of all-African American combat
      units and the events of the war sometimes resulted in temporary integration of African Americans
      into white units, as well as more frequent combat roles. As a result, social consciousness about
      discrimination expanded and the civil rights movement eventually became stronger. This would
      also contribute to President Truman’s decision to begin official integration of the armed forces
      in 1948.

      The language of Native Americans (ie Navajo “code-talkers”) was the most noted contribution of
      the ethnic minority to the war effort. Japanese people and those having Japanese ancestry – with
      the excuse of possible disloyalty and espionage – were relocated in internment camps in the interior
      of the United States and Canada. Countries – such as Peru – having significant Asiatic immigration
      received political pressure to apply similar domestic policies with little result.

      Germans suffered comparatively less in the Americas, as they were part of big communities and,
      due to their European ancestry, even better integrated, though some were also placed in internment
      camps.

      If only women or ethnic minorities are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

16.   “The Second World War greatly transformed inter-American diplomacy and economic
      interaction in the years 1939–1945.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates can agree or disagree with the statement, but in all cases they should focus on
      diplomatic and economic factors and the way in which they were affected during the war. Some
      references to pre- and post-war periods may be necessary in order to develop the arguments, but the
      focus should remain on the period 1939–1945.

      Inter-American cooperation during the war set the stage for the post-war formation of the OAS.
      Two examples of this cooperation could be the 1939 Panama Declaration which created a
      Pan-American Security Zone and the 1940 Havana Conference which established an inter-
      American defense of Dutch and French colonies in the Americas and the promise of collective
      security. Diplomats were crucial for the increase of international trade and commerce – not only
      related to the acquisition of arms and military devices, as well as for the promotion of agreements
      and mutual cooperation. Some examples of that type of agreement were: (a) Inter-American Coffee
      agreement, (b) Inter-American Defense Board, (c) Summits of 1944, (d) Chapultepec Act,
      (e) Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Río Treaty), etc.

      Economic aspects which might be addressed include: transportation systems; electrification;
      expansion of local and national industries; increase of domestic market; relative post-war decline in
      the exports of crops; accumulation of finance and monetary resources; capital investment; labour
      markets. The war allowed rich countries to use their natural resources as an instrument for
      negotiation. Once the war was over, relations among some American countries were considerably
      changed.

      Stronger answers will focus and analyse the way in which complexity in the relations evolved in the
      interaction during the war.

Political developments in the Americas after the Second World War 1945–1979

17.   Compare and contrast the social policies of two leaders in the Americas from the mid 1940s to
      the 1970s.

      Candidates can choose any two leaders in the region. If the leaders came to power before 1945 but
      their policies and influence in their respective countries continued after 1945, they should be
      accepted as valid cases. Stronger candidates will address political context as the framework of
      social policies.

      Most of the countries had significantly transformed – in many cases improved – their social
      characteristics and structure after the Second World War, although with uneven results. Urban
      areas generally presented significant advantages over rural areas, with few exceptions. Access to
      employment, education, health services, transportation, housing and gender issues varied.

      United States
      The Second World War imposed changes to social domestic policies. Democrats and Republicans
      differed in their approaches, so depth and speed of change varied accordingly.

      Civil rights, employment, inflation and wages, rights of labour and expansion of access to housing,
      were policies addressed by Truman as a sort of extension of the New Deal legislation.

      Eisenhower: social security, formal integration of the armed forces (begun by Truman), questions of
      the federal role in education and health care, creation of an interstate highway system were all
      addressed with different degrees of effectiveness in the end.

      The “New Frontier” was designed and partially developed by Kennedy. His social agenda was
      initially retaken and continued by Johnson under the title of the “Great Society”: civil rights, attack
      on poverty, access to health programs (Medicare and Medicaid), federal aid to education.

      Nixon dedicated efforts to control the federal budget in relation to prices and wages, trying to
      reform the welfare system, shifting responsibility for some social programs to the state and local
      level (revenue-sharing), trying to guarantee minimum income, 18-year-olds got the right to vote and
      death penalty was revised.

      Latin America
      Perón, Vargas and Castro might be popular choices though any relevant Latin American leader
      should be accepted.

      Formation and/or consolidation of unions; legislation in order to improve the rights of workers,
      general work conditions and wages as well as free expression and protest; improvement in gender
      issues addressing parity of women and native communities related to basic rights as individuals and
      as citizens; access to educational and health programs for poor people; expansion of the welfare
      state to aged and disabled; general social security legislation were considered by almost all social
      policies after the Second World War.

      Ideological perspective and legality of the administration were determinant in shaping policies in
      Latin America. Thus, their acceptance, permanence and consolidation varied accordingly.

      Canada
      The time period of 1945 to the mid 1970s sees the development of the Canadian “welfare state”,
      especially under the liberal governments of St. Laurent, Pearson and Trudeau.

      The Canada Pension Plan is established (1951 – St. Laurent); unemployment insurance program and
      rise of organized labour (1960s/70s – Pearson and Trudeau); Universal Health Care is established
      (1967–1972 – Trudeau); Canada becomes a bilingual nation (1963–1969 – Pearson and Trudeau).
      In contrast, under the Conservative government of Diefenbaker (1957–1963) the focus is on the
      development of transportation infrastructure (St. Lawrence Seaway and Trans-Canada Highway).
      Diefenbaker’s government also established the first Canadian Bill of Rights (1960).

      If only compare or contrast is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


18.   Why was there a Silent (or Quiet) Revolution in Canada in the 1960s?

      This is a classic question about causality. The best answers will avoid a simple narrative of the
      variety of changes that took place in Canada throughout the 1960s which can be said to have
      constituted the “Revolution” as defined by the candidate. Higher marks will be scored where those
      elements are organized analytically and hierarchically, into immediate, short and long term
      political, economic and social causes. Allow the candidate to challenge the term “revolution” or
      even the phrase “Silent Revolution”, as long as the argument is supported by concrete evidence.

      The phrase “Silent” or “Quiet Revolution” is normally applied to the province of Quebec, rather
      than the country as a whole. The “revolution” itself is usually seen as beginning with Lesage in
      1960 and ending in the October Crisis of 1970, and is usually seen as involving such things as: the
      setting up of a welfare state; a public education system; secularization; federalization of politics;
      nationalization of electricity; rise of Quebec nationalism. With regard to causes, students might
      raise arguments about whether the trigger was Duplessis’ death in 1959 followed by that of his
      successor Sauvé; the unpopularity of the Catholic Church (due to its support for the United States in
      the 1949 Asbestos strike); corruption of Duplessis’ government; political reasons could include the
      rise of Quebec Liberalism; some argue the Quiet Revolution should be seen as part of a wider North
      American process already underway, and thus the logical evolution of a longer term process.

The Cold War and the Americas 1945–1981

19.   Explain the changing nature of the United States’ involvement in Vietnam between 1963
      and 1975.

      President Kennedy (1963)
      Kennedy, during the final year of his presidency, oversaw a substantial increase in the number of
      military advisors in Vietnam and allowed the CIA to participate in the overthrow of Diem as leader
      of SVN.

      President Johnson (1963–1969)
      President Johnson ordered US Navy operations off the coast of North Vietnam and used the alleged
      response to gain the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964) from Congress, providing a “blank cheque”
      for further US economic and military commitments in Vietnam; following Viet Cong attacks at
      Pleiku, Johnson ordered bombing attacks against North Vietnam (operation Rolling Thunder) and
      vastly escalated the size and combat role of US troop strength (approximately 185 000 by end of
      1965 increasing to 540 000 by 1968); “bombing halts” were announced in 1966 and 1967 but were
      temporary and had little effect; refused to support the Joint Chiefs of Staff request for 200 000
      additional troops following the Tet Offensive; in March of 1968, Johnson announced a more
      substantial group of restrictions: freezing of troop levels, bombing limitations and shift of more
      responsibility to South Vietnam in order to encourage peace talks.

      President Nixon (1969–1974)
      President Nixon engaged in secret bombing of Cambodia, followed by US forces invading
      Cambodia in 1970; used massive bombing against North Vietnam in 1972 in attempt to force
      settlement; began policy of “Vietnamization” that led to reduction from 540 000 in 1969 to 30 000
      troops by 1972; proclaimed the “Nixon Doctrine” that would limit US ground forces in future
      Southeast Asia conflicts; applied secret negotiations of Henry Kissinger to achieve Paris Accords of
      1973, providing a framework for the end of the war.

      President Ford (1974–1976)
      Following Nixon’s resignation in August of 1974, Congress reduced financial aid to South
      Vietnam. The Congressional elections of 1974 led to the election of representatives that further
      restricted funding and military operations. In a speech in April 1975, Ford declared an end to US
      funding and the war. By April 1975, Saigon had fallen to the control of the combined Viet Cong
      and North Vietnamese forces.

      Candidates are not required to structure their response by Presidential administration, but are
      expected to demonstrate a chronological progression as to the changing US role.

      Do not expect candidates to include all of the above, but reward those who demonstrate the ability
      to reflect both escalation and limitation in respect to US policy toward the war.

20.   Examine the effects of McCarthyism on society and culture in the United States from the late
      1940s to the late 1950s.

      Joseph McCarthy was elected to the US Senate in 1946 and made his initial reputation as an
      anti-Communist in a 1950 speech in which he accused the State Department of harbouring 205
      Communists. While McCarthy did not initiate the “Second Red Scare”, his use of the McCarthy
      Hearings to search for alleged subversion and his reckless sensationalism greatly encouraged public
      sentiment in support of extreme actions that often abused the civil liberties of the accused. As a
      consequence, even those anti-Communist extremes that preceded his election have become known
      as a part of “McCarthyism”.

      Major events of the period included, but were not limited to: the Alger Hiss case (1948) and the
      Rosenberg trial (1950) contributed to the perception of extensive communist infiltration of
      American society; the House Un-American Activities Committee blacklisted Hollywood directors,
      actors and screenwriters due to their alleged “subversive views”, making them unemployable;
      Congress passed, over President Truman’s veto, the McCarran Internal Security Act (1950) which
      required Communists to register and barred their entry into the United States.

      Among the effects of McCarthyism were: loss of employment and destruction of careers;
      accusations and penalties not based on evidence causing the violation of civil liberties and the “rule
      of law” principle; the suppression of dissent against the assumptions of the Cold War; the
      submission of politicians to the public hysteria that supported the hunt for subversives along with
      political exploitation of the fear of communism; support for vast increases of the defence budget
      and the growth of power and influence by the military–industrial complex; suppression of
      opposition to the Korean War; support for local, state and national “loyalty oaths” and loyalty
      review boards to oversee hiring practices; free reign for J Edgar Hoover and the FBI to engage in
      illegal actions against suspected “subversives” – the suspects were barred from access to the
      “evidence” or to knowledge of the accusations that led to their being fired; opposition to the United
      Nations, social welfare programmes, union organization, civil rights programmes, vaccinations,
      fluoridation, etc all of which were seen as Communist conspiracies.

      McCarthy’s efforts continued until public support declined after he accused the US Army (Army-
      McCarthy Hearings) of having come under Communist influence.

      While marks may be earned by the accurate definition of McCarthyism and evidence of knowledge
      as to the events of the era, candidates should be rewarded for analysis of the effects these events had
      on the domestic culture of the United States.

Civil rights and social movements in the Americas

21.   Evaluate the successes and failures of the feminist movement in one country of the region
      during the period 1945–1979.

      While the most popular choice will likely be the US, accept examples from any country that assess
      the advancement of women’s rights.

      Topics which have potential for evaluation include, but are not limited to:

       Political Leadership: the role of women in political activism; lobbying activities for issues of
        importance to women; leadership positions in political organizations; elected and appointed
        positions of leadership.
       Educational Opportunity: access to education (from elementary through post-secondary);
        percentage of women gaining degrees from secondary and university institutions; access to
        professional degree programs.
       Professional Careers: removal of exclusionary laws and customs for access to professions;
        percentage of women entering careers in law, medicine, engineering, etc; access to careers in the
        military.
       Protection of Women’s Civil Rights and Equality of Opportunity: gender-equality legislation;
        issues of equal pay; capacity to initiate anti-discrimination suits; judicial treatment of sexual
        harassment, sexual battery, rape, etc.
       Personal Freedom: access to contraception and abortion choices; mores regarding sexual
        “double-standard”.
       Portrayal of Women: how women are portrayed in print media, advertising, television and
        movies.
       Economic Status: percentage of women in work force, equality of compensation; access to credit
        and loans; women in entrepreneurial roles.

      Do not expect coverage of all the listed topics, but reward application of specific knowledge and
      analysis as to the achievements and limitations or failures of the feminist movement.

22.   How successful were United States governmental institutions in advancing civil rights for
      African Americans after 1945?

      Remain open to the idea that some candidates may challenge whether government institutions were
      the most effective agents of change or whether substantial change took place. Do not expect all of
      the below, but in any case, the focus must remain on US government institutions and candidates
      should be rewarded for answers that apply specific knowledge and analysis towards the demands of
      the question.

      Executive
       Truman: established a Civil Rights Commission that published a study (“To Secure These
        Rights”). In 1948, Truman issued Executive Order 9981 which began steps toward the
        integration of the armed forces.
       Eisenhower: appointed Earl Warren to position of Chief Justice of US Supreme Court (Warren
        would issue the historic Brown decision); use of federal troops to enforce federal court order
        integrating Little Rock, Arkansas Central High School.
       Kennedy: used of federal Marshalls and troops to enforce enrollment of James Meredith in
        University of Mississippi; Attorney General Robert Kennedy issued ruling requiring the
        Interstate Commerce Commission to end discrimination in interstate travel.
       Lyndon Johnson: support for 1964 Civil Rights Act which made segregation illegal in public
        facilities (“public accommodations law”) and additional federal enforcement of school
        desegregation; reaction to violence against peaceful Selma, Alabama marchers led to address to
        Congress in support of Voting Rights Act of 1965; publicly supported 24th Amendment
        abolishing the poll tax (voting tax); supported 1968 Civil Rights Act prohibiting discrimination
        in sale, rental and financing of housing.
       Nixon: applied the concept of “New Federalism”, Nixon’s administration helped to set up
        bi-racial state committees to aid in the implementation of school desegregation.

      Judicial
       1954 Brown v Board of Education: Chief Justice Warren and the Court unanimously held that
        the “separate but equal” doctrine in public education was unconstitutional.
       1955 “Brown II”: The Court added that the dual public education system must be abolished,
        “with all deliberate speed”. Due to tactics of opposition, integration proceeded very slowly.
       1956 Browder v Gayle: struck down Alabama law requiring segregation of buses (response to
        Montgomery bus boycott).

      Legislative
       1957 Civil Rights Act: established a permanent Civil Rights Commission; the Attorney General
        was authorized to seek injunctions against obstruction of voting rights by state officials.
       1960 Civil Rights Act: expanded the enforcement powers of the 1957 act and provided criminal
        penalties for obstruction of court orders.
       1962: Congress proposed legislation to outlaw the poll tax by constitutional amendment; the 24 th
        Amendment was ratified by the states and became effective in 1964.
       1964 Civil Rights Act: prohibited discrimination in public accommodations and schools;
        outlawed discrimination in federally funded projects; created the Equal Employment
        Opportunities Commission; provided additional enforcement powers on behalf of voting rights.
       1965 Voting Rights Act: suspended use of literacy tests and other discriminatory devices;
        authorized federal examiners to supervise voting registration in states that had low voter
        registration; directed the Attorney General to institute proceedings against the use of the poll tax.

Into the twenty-first century — from the 1980s to 2000

23.   “The presidency of Ronald Reagan marked a turning point in United States domestic affairs.”
      With reference to the period 1980–2000, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Much depends on what is meant by “turning point”, but answers should focus exclusively on
      Reagan’s domestic policies, the most likely of which are: supply-side economics; federal tax
      reduction; spending cuts; deregulation; his actions against labour unions. Possible “turning points”
      might be: the economic turn-around; the same economic recovery could be seen as a turning point
      in the income gap between rich and poor; his scaling back of affirmative action; restrictions on
      abortion; policies aimed at reducing the welfare state; his “revitalization” of the presidency after the
      Watergate problems and the tensions of the Ford and Carter years and the claim that he restored
      Americans’ self-confidence. The most popular “turning point” might be his neo-liberal
      “Reaganomics” – the reduction of restrictions on the free-market economy, in particular the stock
      market and corporate mergers. The huge federal deficits could be seen as fundamental in changing
      the context of future political debates about social programmes.

      This might be a question that attracts much rhetoric. Only reward solid and specific arguments
      focused on the question and limited to the time period specified.


24.   Analyse the reasons for the transition to democracy in one country of Latin America in the
      1980s and 1990s.

      Answers will vary according to the particular conditions of the country. However, some issues that
      influenced the transition were: the deep economic crisis with which Latin America was confronted
      at the time; the coalitions supporting the military juntas turned out to be relatively fragile; local
      industries felt threatened by multinational corporations, and the military’s policies of annihilation of
      any opposition aroused protest from intellectuals, artists, and middle sector representatives. Other
      pressures came also from below. One conspicuous feature of Latin American politics throughout
      the 1980s was the rise of civil participation, as ordinary citizens began to insist on their rights and
      demanded accountability from governments. In part this resulted from the uniting of opposition
      forces produced by the brutality of military repression and reduced US support for such
      governments. In part, it was an increased commitment to the electoral process, as people demanded
      free and fair elections. In Argentina, the defeat in the Malvinas War could be a relevant reason for
      political change. Another factor is the demoralization and division of the left.

      Note that the time period is the 1980s and 1990s.
