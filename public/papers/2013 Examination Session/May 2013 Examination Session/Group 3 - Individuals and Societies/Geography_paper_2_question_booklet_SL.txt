              (ii)   Referring to the diagram, identify two features of this system that make it
                     an example of fair trade.                                                                                                    [2]

      (b)     Explain how fair trade can help to alleviate local food shortages in regions where
              food crops are grown.                                                                                                               [6]

      (c)     “Food miles are an excellent indicator of agriculture’s environmental impact.”  
              Discuss this statement, referring to examples.                                                                                     [10]

		(ii)            State two examples of diseases of affluence.                                     [2]

      (b)   Explain why health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) is a better way to quantify
            the health of a community than infant mortality.                                       [6]

      (c)   To what extent have the management strategies for one named disease been
            successful?  Refer to one country or region in your answer.                           [10]
