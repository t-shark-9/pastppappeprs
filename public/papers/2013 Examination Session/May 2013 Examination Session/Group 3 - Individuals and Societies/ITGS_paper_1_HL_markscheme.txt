Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                               SECTION A

1.   Libraries and e-book loans

     (a)   (i)    Identify the steps a new library user must follow to log in to the library
                  and “borrow” an e-book.                                                    [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   register at the library as a new user or go to the webpage
                   receive new username and password
                   enter username and password
                   search for e-book (by category, by author, etc)
                   select book and check for availability
                   if the book is available, select it for download
                   select the file type for the e-book
                   download the selected book to the user’s device
                   if not available, make a reservation / be placed on a waiting list for the
                    book.

                  Award [1 mark] for any of the points stated above up to a maximum of
                  [4 marks].

           (ii)   When e-books are purchased by the library it needs to record
                  information about them in the relational database. All books require
                  ISBN, publisher information, author and title. State two pieces of
                  additional information that a library would need to record about
                  an e-book.                                                           [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   type of license, for example multi-user, site license

(b)   (i)    Some e-book readers use a proprietary file format, others use generic
             file formats. Explain one advantage for the company who produces and
             sells the e-books of using a proprietary format.                      [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
              proprietary formats provides a format that allows improvements/special
               functionality for the e-book
              the company’s e-books may only be used on their specific e-book reader
               (ie may not be downloaded into other readers, will increase sales of their
               own readers)
              some proprietary formats do not allow sharing, for example copying,
               printing or side-load (move between reader devices).

             N.B. The advantage must be for the company.

             Award [1 mark] for identifying an advantage.
             Award an additional [1 mark] for an explanation of the advantage up to a
             maximum of [2 marks].

      (ii)   Explain why a relational database has been chosen as the basis of the
             lending system.                                                       [4 marks]

             Answers may include:
              relational database avoids data redundancy, duplication of data – data
               will be saved once in a record and information tables is linked
              avoiding errors in data entry – information will only be entered and saved
               once
              less storage space needed – duplication of data would mean additional
               storage space would be required.

             [1 mark]
             A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the
             reason is not clear.

             [2–3 marks]
             A reasonable description of why a relational database has been chosen with
             reference to the lending system. The answer may be unbalanced and lack
             appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

             [4 marks]
             A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of why a relational database has
             been chosen with explicit reference to the lending system.

             N.B. Maximum of [1 mark] for no reference to the lending system.

(c)   A school library has introduced the loan of e-books. Discuss the impact on
      the students.                                                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive impacts on the students
       students may be able to “carry” many books in one electronic device without
        worrying about the weight
       students can make “annotations” electronically without scribbling on a book
        owned by the library
       students can combine the use of a book and a dictionary in case some
        clarification of terms is needed
       some electronic readers may have an application that will “read” the book
        (audio format)
       font size and background shades/colours can be changed to help readers with
        vision problems
       if there is a technical problem, it may be possible for the student to borrow the
        e-book again
       students may be able to collaborate using e-book note-taking features
       students can access the library 24/7 / students do not have to go physically go
        to library
       students may access to a wider range of e-books because e-books do not take
        up physical space
       student will not have to worry about missing the due date for returning the
        book which is automatically managed by the system
       student will not need to spend time in the library searching for a book –
        searching can now be done by a query on the e-reader.

      Negative impacts on the students
       students may need training to use the electronic reader
       students may not have access to e-books (eg no e-book reader, no Internet
        access, malfunctioning reader)
       students may be concerned with the e-book reader being stolen, damaged or
        lost
       students will spend additional hours viewing a computer screen
       the e-book reader could lead students to be distracted.

      N.B. Do not accept answers about how the student feels about using an e-book.

      Answers may include:
       government requires retailers of the equipment / manufacturers to take back
        obsolete equipment and dispose of it responsibly
       government can provide a service to collect obsolete equipment from
        homes/offices
       government may provide legal disposal/recycling locations
       government will offer financial incentives to customers (businesses,
        individuals, schools, …) wishing to upgrade IT equipment if they take their old
        equipment to official recycling locations
       government provides information in TV commercials, websites, help phone
        line about the ways to recycle and the dangers of e-waste

                   enter acceptable limits for the condition in the IT monitoring system
                   sensor measures the required condition
                   measurement is sent to IT monitoring system software
                   analogue measurements are converted to a digital format
                   the patient’s current condition is compared with acceptable limits stored
                    in the IT system
                   if outside limit, an alert message appears.

                  N.B. The focus is on the IT monitoring system. Do not consider attaching

      Answers may include:
       doctors can choose to directly receive patient data/alerts when conditions
        change
       continuous medical information of patients will be available to the doctor
       the warning signs of the IT monitoring system may alert doctors to conditions
        that they were not aware of
       doctors may need to carry an alert device
       doctors may have access to better results (ie additional analysis, more reports)
       doctors will need to be trained to use the new equipment
       new patient monitoring system may save the doctor time allow them to see
        more patients
       doctor may be assigned more patients under the assumption that they need to
        physically visit and check each patient less often with a IT monitoring system
       issues of liability for the doctor if something goes wrong (eg if a doctor fails to
        receive an alert and a patient dies ...)
       doctor can experience technical difficulties when the new patient monitoring
        equipment is implemented that hinders their work
       doctor can better determine which patients require immediate medical care.

      N.B. Only award marks for the implications for doctors.

      Do not accept personal considerations for doctors such as stress, distrust of
      equipment.

(b)   The design of user-friendly interfaces is a major part of any new system
      development project. Below are examples of two different types of interface.

      Contrast the usability of the two interfaces shown here.                                [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Interface A
       appearance is cluttered and difficult to use (ie too much information, too much
         functionality on one screen)
       requires specialist terminology to use the interface
       many options can be set at one time
       related functions are logically grouped
       end-user cannot change the layout
       familiar interface for specialist/advanced users.

      Interface B
       easier to navigate (ie fewer options appear on the screen at a time)
       icons represent functions instead to text options
       icons can be selected by tapping instead of clicking with a mouse
       on-screen grouping of icons can be determined by the end-user
       intuitive interface for non-specialists.

      between the developers, clients and end-users?                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       the developer gets to know exactly what the client wants
       needs might change during development
       understandings may be refined by frequent consultation
       end-users may not want to use the system if they are not involved
       new ideas can develop as the project progresses
       costs might change, requiring reconsideration of nature of solution
       if clients are involved regularly, they are more likely to be satisfied with the
        solution
       if clients are regularly involved, problems can be immediately solved saving
        time in the long run
       developers are less likely to be blamed for shortcomings if the project is
        regularly discussed with client.

6.   Speech to text software

     (a)   Identify six steps that speech recognition systems must go through in
           converting speech into text.                                          [6 marks]

           Answers may include:
            capture the speech using a microphone
            the microphone converts the sound waves into an analogue signal
            software converts captured analogue signal into a digital representation
            digital representation is held in memory as the speech is being captured
            software removes unwanted noise and sounds
            the digitized sound is normalized so that there is consistent loudness
            digital sounds or words are compared to a database of stored word patterns and
             associated text
            the “best match” for the text is then automatically displayed
            end-user is given the opportunity to edit the text file
            text file is saved.

(b)    Explain why subtitling software works better when re-speaking is used
       rather than using the original voices of the people being interviewed. [6 marks]

       Answers may include:
        re-speaking uses standard voice to be processed / voices differ a great deal
        software has been trained to understand the voice of the speaker
        speaker can speak at specified standard required by the software (ie optimal
         speed, intonation)
        speaker can avoid problematic words such as foreign words
        speaker can insert meaningful breaks so that words are properly recognized
        regional accents not a problem.

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
       it allows interaction of a range of persons with the computer that may not have
        access otherwise (eg disabled, young children)
       the size of the device can be small because it is not limited to keying in
        information
       it reduces the skill level needed so less training of users needed and this
        reduces costs
       faster interaction because no typing
       increases productivity.

      Disadvantages
       it is a complex area to develop
       problems of accents

(b)    Explain how expert systems can be used to help the manufacturer develop
       the next generation of robotic vacuum cleaners.                         [6 marks]

       Interpretation A: the expert system is being used to design a new generation
       of robotic vacuum cleaners.
        the knowledge engineer works with the human expert to describe the problem
          ie the factual information, procedural rules connected with robotic vacuums
        the knowledge engineer translates that knowledge into a knowledge base
        and designs an inference engine to process that knowledge
        the inference engine contains rules to help solve problem in designing the new
          robot
        fuzzy logic may be used to create rules for situations that are inexact
        a user interface allows the designers to interact with the expert system to get
          advice.

       Interpretation B: the expert system is being used to run the vacuum.
        the knowledge engineer works with the human expert to describe the problem
          ie how to determine if the floor is still dirty
        the knowledge engineer translates that knowledge into a knowledge base
        and designs an inference engine to process that knowledge
        the inference engine contains rules to address the problem
        fuzzy logic may be used to create rules for situations that are inexact ie more
          dirty/less dirty

      To what extent is the future of robotics likely to be more about single purpose
      devices such as a vacuum cleaner rather than humanoid/android robots?           [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Factors that encourage further development/use of single purpose devices
       less complex therefore less expensive to produce, purchase and maintain
       a wide variety of uses in areas which are unsafe for humans (Mars, inside
        active volcano craters, bomb detection in wars etc)
       require less battery power (less need to recharge, no need for a power source
        that holds lots of energy)
       not threatening ie no queasiness factor (there is now a term for this “uncanny
        valley”)
       useful for very specific purposes ie assembly lines in factories.

      Factors that limit single purpose devices
       lack of flexibility
       trend to multipurpose devices in other areas (ie phones) leads us to expect them
        to do more
       users want everything in one device.

      Factors that encourage development of androids
       need for care of aging/invalid/disabled people with fewer workers to do that
       uses that require human movement but are too dangerous for humans, ie
        security robots that patrol
       use as research tool to study human body structure and mechanics ie in
        building a robot that moves like humans you learn more about how humans
        move
       can perform jobs that are usually done by humans (receptionist, operate
        equipment designed for the human form etc)
       entertainment (ie animatrons in theme parks)
       to study human interaction and cognition (the android’s ability to elicit
        human-directed social responses enables researchers to employ an android in
        experiments with human participants as an apparatus that can be controlled
        more precisely than a human actor. Wikipedia, Android science).

      Factors that limit development of androids
       no long lasting power sources available yet
       extremely complex – ie very hard to develop human traits especially vision
       uncanny valley – the idea that “when human features look and move almost,
        but not perfectly, like natural human beings, it causes a response of revulsion
        among human observers” (wikipedia)
       loss of jobs that previously could only be done by humans
       legal issues – who is responsible if the android does something problematic
       shouldn’t human beings be caring for human beings instead of robots?

                            A response with no knowledge or understanding of the
       No marks               relevant ITGS issues and concepts.
                            A response that includes no appropriate ITGS terminology.
                            A response with minimal knowledge and understanding of
                              the relevant ITGS issues and concepts.
                            A response that includes minimal use of appropriate
         Basic                ITGS terminology.
                            A response that has no evidence of judgments and/or
      1–2 marks               conclusions.
                            No reference is made to the scenario in the stimulus material
                              in the response.
                            The response may be no more than a list.
                            A descriptive response with limited knowledge and/or
                              understanding of the relevant ITGS issues and/or concepts.
