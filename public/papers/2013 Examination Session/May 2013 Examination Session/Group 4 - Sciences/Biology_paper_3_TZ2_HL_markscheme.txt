examiners in this examination session.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

E3. cocaine is an excitatory drug;

    dopamine is then taken up again/reabsorbed by presynaptic membrane/dopamine
    receptors/transporters;
    cocaine prevents reabsorption of dopamine by the presynaptic membrane;

Option H — Further human physiology

H1. (a)    (children) with asthma have lower lung function / (children) without asthma have
           higher lung function                                                                      [1]

     (b)   7 % (units needed) (accept answers in the range of 6 % to 8 %)                            [1]

     (c)   female lung function higher than male;
           males and females both better (lung function) without asthma;
           males with asthma have a greater reduction in lung function / greater difference
           between males and females with asthma than without asthma;                            [2 max]

     (d)   asthma causes constriction/congestion/inflammation of the airways/breathing
           tubes/bronchi/bronchioles;
           units measure ability to exhale quickly/efficiently which could indicate asthma;          [2]

     (e)   allergens / pollutants / pollen / dust mites / cold (temperature) / viral illness /
           exercise / anxiety/stress / hereditary                                                    [1]



H2. (a)    insulin / growth hormone / glucagon / ADH / FSH / LH / other                              [1]

     (b)   pepsin secreted as pepsinogen / inactive precursor;
           activated by stomach acidity/low pH/HCl;                                                  [2]

     (c)   bile emulsifies/OWTTE lipids so enzymes can act on them                                   [1]

     (d)   hemoglobin from the red blood cells is absorbed/phagocytosed in the liver/by
           Kuppfer cells;
           hemoglobin is broken down into heme and globin groups;
           iron is removed from the heme groups;
           (residue from) heme becomes bilirubin/bile pigment (in hepatocytes);                  [3 max]



H3. during diastole the heart muscles/atria/ventricles are relaxed;
    blood enters the atria;
    during atrial systole the atria contract and blood moves into the ventricles;
    pressure (in ventricles) causes bicuspid/tricuspid/AV valves to close;
    (this) closing of valves causes first heart sound;
    during ventricular systole the ventricles contract causing blood to flow to aorta/
    pulmonary artery/arteries/out of heart;
    semilunar valves close so blood does not return to the ventricles;
    this causes the second heart sound;
    blood leaving atria/ventricles during contraction is caused by increased pressure which
    reduces volume;                                                                              [6 max]
