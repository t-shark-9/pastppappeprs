Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [45 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate‟s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through
      marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                  propellants/aerosols/compressors;
                  soil sterilants/pesticides;
                  fire extinguishers/retardants/foam expansion techniques;
                  production of polystyrene/styrofoam                                               [1 max]
                  Do not accept DDT.
                  Do not accept names of ODS such as CFCs as question asks for source of
                  ODS, or refrigerators as they are in the stem.

           (iii) Strengths: [1 mark]
                 signed up to by most states;
                 inclusive of developing nations as protocol provides support for
                 implementation;
                 implementation of legislation has been very successful in reducing emissions;
                 some replacements for ozone-depleting substances (ODS) have been found;
                 ozone hole is shrinking;

                  Limitations: [1 mark]
                  compliance is not yet 100 % / not all nations are involved with the Protocol;
                  illegal trade still exists;
                  some ODS are exempt from protocol as alternatives are not yet available;
                  some replacements for ODS are also ozone depleting (eg HCFCs) so
                  unsatisfactory;
                  need suitable disposal facilities for stockpiled/old ODS as they will leak into
                  atmosphere if no action taken;
                  disposal is a particular problem in less developed world;                         [2 max]
                  Accept other reasonable responses.

2.   (a)   (i)    sulfuric acid and nitric acid;                                                  [1 max]

           (ii)   transformation process: [1 max]
                  eg burning of fossil fuels in power plant/vehicles changes chemical energy
                  to heat/kinetic energy;
                  eg burning of fossil fuels in power plant/vehicles changes fossil fuels to
                  pollutant gases and ash / formation of acid rain from its precursors (NOx and
                  SOx) / oxidation in the atmosphere;
                  eg condensation of water vapour in clouds changes gas to liquid/ice;

                  transfer process: [1 mark]
                  eg rain moves water from clouds to land/river /dry deposition /wet
                  deposition;
                  eg water and pollutants/acids moved by river;
                  eg wind moves pollutants from power station chimney/vehicle exhausts to
                  other areas/clouds;                                                             [2 max]
                  Do not accept one word answers.

           (iii) acid rain/deposition occurs close to the source;
                 acid rain/deposition has more local/regional effects than ozone depletion or
                 global warming;
                 acid rain/deposition is influenced by regional climatic and geographical
                 conditions;
                 so involves adjacent states/countries in negotiation / many areas of world
                 not affected by acid rain/deposition;                                            [2 max]
                 Do not award marks for simply repeating “acid deposition is controlled
                 mainly by regional agreements” or the converse.

     (b)   (i)    downward trend in emissions of both SOx and NOx / SOx have reduced at
                  faster rate than NOx / NOx have reduced at slower rate than SOx;
                  NOx decline is more consistent/steadier than SOx / SOx decline is more
                  fluctuating than NOx;
                  NOx reduced by only 30 % (accept values between 20–40 %) in 17 years,
                  but SOx reduced by 70 % (accept values between 60–80 %)
                  NOx reduced by less than half as much as SOx / SOx reduced by more than
                  twice as much as NOx;                                                           [2 max]
                  Credit appropriate numerical comparison of the data.
                  Responses must compare and contrast.
                  Do not award marks for describing trends for only one pollutant.

           (ii)   technology: [1 mark]
                  catalytic converters fitted to more vehicles;
                  use of low sulfur diesel;

                  engines more efficient;
                  development of electric/hybrid/hydrogen cars;
                  Do not accept clean/green technology without transport related example.
                  Do not accept less polluting fuel without relevant example, or giving some
                  additional detail.

                  All three required to award [1 mark].

           (ii)   eg nut trees could be exploited for their timber;
                  but if left to grow provide an income of nuts;
                  that can be harvested throughout life of tree without liquidating capital;     [2 max]
                  Accept any other reasonable response.
                  Do not accept timber as an example.

           (ii)   the increase in natural capital/forest biomass/production/net productivity
                  (per unit time) that can be exploited without depleting/damaging original
                  stock /OWTTE;                                                                  [1 max]

           (iv) rate of growth may vary with fluctuations in biotic/abiotic factors / specific
                examples of these eg low rainfall in some years, that depletes stock below
                previous rates / depletion of soil nutrients/minerals / disease depleting
                resources/reducing population;                                                   [1 max ]

     (c)   construct stone lines/bunds across area/dams on slopes / use contour ploughing /
           mulching / afforestation /plant cover;                                                [1 max]
           Accept other reasonable responses



4.   (a)   (i)    Four appropriately named organisms, in the correct order and including
                  relevant named producer organism;
                  Arrows leading from low to high trophic levels;
                  Do not credit food webs.                                                       [2 max]

           (ii)   because there are fewer foxes eating snakes / removal of predator allows
                  prey numbers to increase;                                                      [1 max]

     (b)   in desert, water is limiting so lower productivity;
           in desert, soil nutrients are low due to limited decomposition of organic matter so lower
           productivity;
           greater competition for resources in a desert (in contrast to lower competition in higher
           productivity of a tropical rain forest);
           in desert fewer ecological niches so fewer species;
           in desert lower productivity reduces length of food chains;                       [2 max]
           Accept responses in the converse.
           Accept other reasonable responses.

           (iii) decomposers/detritivores / invertebrates and bacteria / invertebrates and
                 fungi / bacteria and fungi;                                                      [1 max]

     (b)   (because) most energy entering is lost to the environment as heat/
           respiration/waste as it moves from lower to higher trophic levels in the food chain;   [1 max]
           Response must explain how energy is lost. Do not credit responses which only
           give the 10 % or converse 90 % rule, without explanation.

     (c)   entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder/chaos or randomness in a system;
           the greater the disorder the higher the level of entropy;
           in metabolic processes/respiration, a high proportion of energy is always changed
           to heat;
           heat is a more disordered form of energy than stored chemical energy/lower grade
           energy/cannot do useful work (so entropy increases);                                   [2 max]

6.   (a)   (i)    log/logarithmic;                                                               [1 max]

           (ii)   species A has fewer deaths at a young age than species B (which could
                  indicate more parental care for young);
                  species A lives to a greater age than species B and k-strategists tend to be
                  longer lived;                                                                  [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for a suitable density-dependent factor. Must give name of
                  animal eg rabbit or tiger
                  eg competition/availability/supply of food/mating partners/nesting sites /
                  predation /disease;                                                            [1 max]
                  Do not accept plant example.

           (ii)   Explanation: [2 marks]

                  large populations maybe affected by food shortages/disease/predation so
                  population falls (below equilibrium/carrying capacity);

                  smaller populations allows more food per animal, so population rises
                  (overshoots equilibrium level/carrying capacity) / reduction in prey will
                  limit the predator population allowing prey population to grow/recover
                  (negative feedback);

                  cycle repeats again in subsequent years;



                  Accept either S-curve or relevant part of S-curve.
                  Award [1 mark] for a suitable sketch graph.                                    [3 max]

     (b)   Birth rates have decreased for reasons such as: [1 mark]
           better access to contraception;
           education/career opportunities for women;
           urbanization and change in need for large families;
           increased affluence so fewer children;
           decline in influence of religious prohibitions on birth control in some cultures;
           national strategies such as China‟s one child policy;

           Death rates have decreased for reasons such as: [1 mark]
           improved health care/sanitation;
           better diet/greater affluence;
           improved antenatal and postnatal care;                                                 [2 max]
           Accept other reasonable responses.

     (c)   larger population uses more energy/fossil fuels, so produces extra carbon
           dioxide/greenhouse gases;
           larger population uses more land for growing food eg rice / keeps more livestock,
