      determined values of pH were 2.4, 2.5, 2.4 and 2.4. What is the best description of the precision and
      accuracy of these measurements?

                  Precision               Accuracy
      A.         precise                  inaccurate

      B.         not precise              inaccurate

      C.         precise                  accurate

      D.         not precise              accurate
