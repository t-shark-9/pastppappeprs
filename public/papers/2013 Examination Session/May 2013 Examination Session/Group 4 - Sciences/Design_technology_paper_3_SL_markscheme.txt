Subject Details: Design Technology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. (a)    Award [1] for stating one reason why craft-produced breads are generally more
           expensive than mass-produced breads.
           craft production is a labour-intensive process / smaller batches more work/time
           input per loaf;
           more expensive raw materials / specialist ingredients;                              [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying how gluten in flour contributes to the final texture of
           dough and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           gluten is the protein in flour which hydrates to form an elastic matrix;
           this contributes to the elastic nature of the bread dough;                              [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of how the addition
           of yeast to bread dough contributes to the physical properties of
           bread [3 max].
           lowers the density of the dough/bread;
           yeast ferments sugar to carbon dioxide which aerates/produces small gas bubbles
           in the dough;
           the dough/gas expands during heating;
           cooking denatures the gluten so becomes inelastic/retains deformed shape/aerated/
           leavened bread;                                                                     [3 max]



A2. (a)    Award [1] for stating one function of primary food packaging.
           extends shelf life;
           adequately contains product so it does not leak;
           protects the product from damage;
           displays the product so the customer can see what s/he is buying;
           carries nutritional and other information about the food;
           prevents food deteriorating/being contaminated;                                     [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying one benefit of using biodegradable material for food
           packaging and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           can be composted along with the remains of any food it contains;
           less non-biodegradable waste goes to landfill;
           (allegedly) helps reduce global warming;                                            [2 max]
                                                –7–              M13/4/DESTE/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A3. (a)    Award [1] for one reason why it is important that governments raise public
           awareness of food-related health issues and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           eating the wrong balance of foods can result in a wide range of chronic/acute
           food-related issues, for example, obesity, diabetes, food poisoning;
           governments can reduce the incidence of these by providing educational materials
           to raise public awareness of health-related issues/reduce cost of healthcare
           provision;
           governments have a moral responsibility for public health;
           government policies educate public/advocate healthy eating;                        [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct points in an identification of why
           “The eatwell plate” system would not be appropriate for children below the age
           of two years [2 max].
           babies and very young children have different nutritional requirements to older
           children/adults;
           babies and very young children need energy-dense foods/their digestive systems
           cannot cope with the wide range of foods on the eatwell plate some of which are
           difficult to digest;                                                                   [2]



A4. Award [1] for identifying one reason why values of body mass index (BMI) might be
    misleading [2 max].
    BMIs relate to perfect people / fit and healthy people come in a wide variety of shapes
    and sizes;
    the bodyweight of sportspersons, (for example, bodybuilders), may be increased
    through being well-muscled;
    thus their BMI might be high but not indicative of increased risk of heart disease and
    other conditions associated with being overweight/obese;                                  [2 max]



A5. Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of each of how travel and
    the media have promoted the development of an international cuisine
    [3 max] for travel and [3 max] for the media.
    Travel:
    through travelling and eating out more in restaurants people are exposed to different
    dishes;
    on their return home they want to recreate their holiday experiences;
    supermarkets/other food outlets now carry a wide range of authentic ingredients so they
    are able to do this;

     The media:
     cookery books/programmes/commercials/articles in newspapers/magazines present
     dishes from other cultures;
     they show people how dishes from different cultures should be prepared/served;
     people are able to experiment for themselves;                                                [6]

A6. Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of each of three
    implications of urbanization for the food industry in developed countries. [3 max] for
    each factor.
    high population density / lots of people live in a small area;
    urban dwellers often totally reliant on the food industry for the provision of their
    dietary needs;
    they no longer have access to land for growing of food;

     food is a highly-perishable commodity;
     food processing (freezing, canning, etc) extends shelf-life of foods;
     this can facilitate distribution from rural areas where food produced to urban areas
     where food consumed;

     food manufacturers operate just-in-time (JIT) systems to deliver food to the point
     of sale;
     CIM/logistics enable this;
     they ensure the right amounts of food products are available as and when required by
     consumers;

     more food shops;
     provide access to food in urban areas;
     encourage/promote the development of new food products;

     better law enforcement;
     easier access for law enforcement officials;
     forces higher standards;                                                                [9 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of how the circuit
           operates when the switch is opened [3 max].
           when the switch opens, the voltage on the capacitor rises;
           the timer starts;
           when the voltage on the capacitor meets/exceeds that of the R1 R2 divider the
           comparator switches low, so turning on/activating the relay;

           when switch opens, current from the resistor flows into the capacitor;
           capacitor charges / its voltage rises from 0V;
           after some time it goes above/exceeds the voltage at the +/non-inverting input and the
           output from the op amp switches over/becomes zero/low;
           turns on/activates relay;                                                                [3 max]

     TDM users have an individual signal digitally coded in short duration pulses/bursts;
     pulses for each user are sent in order along the link in “packets”;
     the receiver must be synchronized with the user so information bytes can be correctly
     reassembled to produce signals;                                                              [6]
