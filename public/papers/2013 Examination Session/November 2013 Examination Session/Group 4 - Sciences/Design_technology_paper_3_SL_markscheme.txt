Subject Details: Design Technology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

3.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct points in a description of the role of B vitamins for
           athletes [2 max].
           B vitamins are important for energy production;

           potassium - It is important in the transmission of nerve impulses, the building
           muscle tissue and for the beating of the heart;                                            [2 max]

5.   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of each of two types of food spoilage
     [3 max] per type, [6 max].
     physical spoilage;
     protective outer layer of food is damaged, for example, by rough handling or pest damage;
     increases the chance of microbiological or chemical spoilage;

     chemical spoilage;
     leads to changes in the colour/taste of foods;
     for example, rancidity of oils/fats;

     microbiological spoilage;

6.   Award [1] for each distinct point in each of three ways in which on-farm processing can
     enhance the sustainability of the rural economy [3 max] per way, [9 max] total.
     processed foods command a higher price/cost more than unprocessed materials;
     therefore farmers get a larger share of the food dollar;
     this contributes to economic sustainability;

     on-farm processing creates jobs in the rural economy;
     therefore people do not have to migrate from rural areas to find jobs;
     this contributes to social sustainability;

     consumer confidence;
     provenance is increasingly important for consumers;
     knowing where and by whom the food was produced makes it more attractive to consumers;

     on-farm processing reduces food miles/the distance that food travels from the production
     to consumption;
     less energy is invested in the production/distribution of the processed food;
     this contributes to environmental sustainability;                                          [9 max]

           manufacturer might decide to use the quad logic chip shown in Figure B1 in
           circuit design [3 max].
           NAND (and NOR) gates are universal logic gates/all digital logic functions can be
           implemented without using other gates;
           the manufacturer would not have to hold different stock items;
           the manufacturer might get a better price for buying components in bulk;              [3]

           reprogrammability;                                                                    [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying way that programmable interface controllers have
           contributed to an increase in the portability of electronic products and [1] for an
           explanation [2 max].
           PICs are small but powerful devices;
           which have replaced larger/amount of components so overall product size can
           be reduced;                                                                           [2]

            which the resistance of R2 lies including units [2 max].
            brown = 1, green = 5, orange = 3 0s so 15000 Ω gold = + 5 % ;
            142500 – 15750 Ω/14.25 – 15.75kΩ;                                                         [2]

      (b)   Award [1] for showing the working and [1] for the correct answer [2 max].
            Vout/Vin = R2/(R1+ R2);

11.   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of each of two criteria for
      an appropriate solution for the supply of electricity to communities in remote areas of
      developing countries [3 max] per way, [6 max].
      the technology must be understood by local communities;
      it must be consistent with local skills and resources;
      so that it empowers them not subjugates them;

      cost-effectiveness;
      extending the National Grid is unlikely to be cost-effective;
      there needs to be a localized solution for the supply of electricity;

      the solution needs to be based on renewable resources,
      for example, hydroelectric, solar and wind;
      non-renewable resources are finite;

      the solution should not be based on fossil fuels unless they are particularly abundant in
      the area;
      fossil fuels are non-renewable;
      they also generate carbon emissions;                                                        [6 max]

      cost-effective solution;

      ease of installation;
      they are not as fragile as fibre optic cables;
      a copper wire system requires less technical expertise than a fibre optic system;

      maintenance;
      more straightforward maintenance required;
      less specialist skill/equipment required;                                                [9]

      there is a wider choice for consumers;
      consumers may choose furniture based on price range;
      or styles/surface finish/colour;

      many designs are modular;
      consumers can mix and match;
      to suit lifestyle/space available/match with existing furniture;;

      fixtures and fittings are standardized;

      instructions for assembly are included in the pack;

      furniture is flat-packed;
      can be stored easily by the retailer;
      transported by the consumer/promotes impulse buying;

      planned obsolescence;
      consumers do not expect furniture to last a long time;

      CAD/CAM requires high scales of production;
      cost effective production;
      cheaper products for the consumer;

      shorter lead times for furniture production;
      supports JIT production and reduces storage cost and capital investment in inventory;
      reduced costs for customer;

      reduced costs for customer;
      makes latest styles of furniture quickly/cheaply available to customers;
      facilitates ease of distribution;                                                         [9 max]

      may be too complicated for the user to remember how to operate the product;
      user may only be able to access a small proportion of the product’s functionality;

      good/intuitive user interface organization;
      ensures the product is easy to use;                                                    [2 max]

      Sure grip cutlery is designed to fit into the hand;
      so the full strength of the arm muscles can be used;
      but the Baroque cutlery is held by the fingers and requires more dexterity to use;     [6 max]
