Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer the
questions.

The Roomba® (Figure 8) was the first low-cost vacuum cleaning robot.  It was developed by the iRobot®
company which has a reputation for its pioneering corporate strategy. The Roomba® can be programmed to
clean at particular times of the day and can work without supervision while its owners are out at work. It is
30 cm in diameter and 10 cm high. It has rechargeable batteries that provide approximately 90 minutes of
cleaning for each charge and returns automatically to its base to recharge (Figure 9).
