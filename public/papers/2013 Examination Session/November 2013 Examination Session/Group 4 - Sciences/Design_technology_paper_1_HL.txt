29.   The mechanism operating a foot-operated trash/rubbish bin is a very simple linkage. It consists of a
      series of fixed and moving pivots and levers.  As a foot presses on the pedal the linkage (X) to which
      it is attached moves downwards forcing the next linkage (Y) to move upwards and to open the lid
      (Figure 15). Which element of the foot-operated trash/rubbish bin mechanism is an example of a
      fixed pivot?

Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer the
questions.

The original red Associated Equipment Company (AEC) Routemaster bus developed in 1954 became an
iconic feature of London’s streets (Figure 16). The bus is driven by an electric motor powered by a battery
pack recharged by a diesel engine that only runs when the battery needs charging so the redesigned bus
produces less pollution and has better fuel consumption. A prototype of a new Routemaster bus (Figure 17)
modelled on the original but with enhanced performance was used in a field trial on the streets of London
in February 2012. The windows allow more daylight into the bus and give the driver better kerbside views.
There are two staircases and three doors – one at the front, a ramped centre door and an open platform at
the rear to allow passengers to “hop-on hop-off” (Figure 18).
