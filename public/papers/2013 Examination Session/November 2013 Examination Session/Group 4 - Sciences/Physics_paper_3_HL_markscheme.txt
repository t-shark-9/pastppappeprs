This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

1.   (a)   realizes that motion of Canis Minor is due to Earth’s rotation (relative to stars);
           specific reference to west to east rotation of Earth and relative opposite rotation of
           Canis Minor;                                                                              [2]
           If second marking point is awarded then award first marking point also.

     (c)   (i)    apparent magnitude is smaller than/similar to absolute magnitude;
                  so Luyten's star must be closer than 10 (pc) / must be relatively close to
                  Earth;

                  Allow third marking point (ECF) after incorrect value for d only if value is
                  less than 1000 (pc).
                  Do not award the third marking point for vague statements that the distance
                  is within parallax range.

           (ii)   Allow a very wide range of upper limits:
                  up to X; (where 10 kpc < X < 10 Mpc)                                               [1]

           when VIN becomes  Vx , VOUT switches to –15 (V);
           when VIN becomes  Vx , VOUT switches to +15 (V);                                   [4]
           Accept similar arguments which refer to Vsupply instead of 15 (V).
           Accept answers which use values for Vx (  1.5(V)) in second, third and fourth
           marking points.
           Allow third and fourth marking points even if the polarities are the other way
           round.

                   Do not apply a marking penalty if attenuation effect of enamel is ignored,
                   as it is the same for both rays.
                   Award first and second marking point by implication if only the correct
                   working of the third marking point is shown.

                   least two significant figures in the final answer (3.059...).

            (ii)   intensity ratio is very small / intensity for A is much less than at B;
                   so if the contrast is correct for B, it cannot be correct for A / A will be
                   underexposed so contrast will be poor;                                                                     [2]
                   or
                   compared to B, the much smaller intensity for A is due to the filling;
                   for A, small changes in enamel attenuation coefficient will be insignificant
                   compared to that of the filling, so contrast is poor;

      (d)   acoustic impedance difference between decayed and good tissue is very small so
            reflection will be weak;
            the acoustic impedance of tissue/decayed tissue is much smaller than for enamel
            so contrast would be poor;
            difficult to get ultrasound signal into tooth given mismatch between acoustic
            impedance of air and enamel;
            there will be a strong internal reflection when reflection from tissue is incident on
            enamel from inside;                                                                                           [2 max]

                   five days is about 150 times the physical half-life, so activity will be
                   minimal long before time to excrete;
                   the effective half-life is almost equal to physical half-life, so biological
                   half-life is unimportant;                                                              [1 max]

            (ii)   reference to greater quality factor/RBE for alpha / OWTTE;
                   alpha particles have short range so concentrates effect on tumour;
                   short effective half-life so disappears quickly/no long-term risk;
                   as beta is low energy likely to be absorbed by tumour mass too;

21.   The question refers to high energy protons so accept the following:
      by experiments such as deep inelastic scattering;
                                                            (the question refers to high energy
      where high energy leptons/electrons/protons collide 
                                                            protons, so allow protons as well
      with protons;                                         as leptons or electrons)
                                                           
      the scattering data show that protons are composed of quarks/more elementary particles;
      at high energies quarks display asymptotic freedom;
      free quarks are not observed – showers of mesons/baryons/hadrons are;
      this is called quark confinement / this is known as hadronization;                           [4 max]
      or
      The question refers to high energy protons, which may elicit responses which refer to,
      for example, LHC proton-proton scattering or collisions. This is not on the syllabus,
      but award up to [3 max] to responses including any correct Physics.
      eg.:
      mention of two beams of high energy protons colliding;
      in a particle accelerator such as LHC;
      mention of re-creation of conditions in the early hot universe;
      mention of quark - gluon plasma;
      mention of discovery of W/Z/Higgs boson;



22.   (a)   nucleosynthesis is the production of nuclei/elements from (more fundamental)
            particles by fusion;                                                                       [1]

      (b)   in the very early universe the temperature/particle energy was too high for nucleons
            to be stable/exist/fuse;
            during the 17 minutes the temperature/energy range was suitable for maintaining
            fusion;
            after this time the temperature/energy was too low for fusion;                             [3]
            To award [3] responses must refer to temperature or (particle) energy.
