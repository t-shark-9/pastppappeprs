      “Green” Buses in Vancouver, Canada

       I visited Vancouver last month, and I was really impressed by how committed
       the city is to becoming green. You see, to make it easier for people to come to
       the city from other areas, all public transport buses are equipped with bike racks.
       Combining cycling and taking the bus is a great way to get around while making
 5     sustainability a part of people’s lifestyle.

       Bikes are allowed on buses any
       time and there is no additional
       cost. Yes, there is only space for
       two bikes per bus, but you can
10     easily wait for the next one.

       Putting your bike on the rack is no                     Image removed for
       problem. Before the bus arrives,                         copyright reasons
       you remove all loose items like
       water bottles or pumps. When the
15     bus arrives, you tell the driver you
       want to load your bike, and then
       you lower the bike rack by pulling
       on the handle. You lift your bike
       on the rack and secure it with the
20     support arm over the front tire.

       When you get off the bus, exit by the front door and tell the driver that you want
       to remove your bike. If the rack is empty after your bike is taken off, put it back in
       the upright position. You see, it’s fast and easy!

       Jack, the friend who showed me around his town, says he doesn’t like the fact
25     that large bicycles and motorbikes are not allowed on buses, but I still think
       it is a good way to reduce our carbon footprints and save the environment.
       Yes, with all the bike lanes and this “Bikes on Buses” idea, Vancouver is on
       its way to becoming a greener city, and it is encouraging people to adopt a
       healthier lifestyle.

       Building a Nation
       In 2012, the South African government
       launched its annual Youth Camp project.                            Image removed for
       Each province selects their participants                            copyright reasons
       according to set criteria.

 5     These Youth Camps intend to empower young
       people with values, skills and knowledge
       through outdoor adventure, games and other
       activities. The aim is to keep young people active, increase self-esteem, and promote patriotism and
       a strong sense of citizenship.

10     Mosa, who attended the ﬁrst Youth Camp, talks about her experience.

       How did you feel about being invited to attend Youth Camp and what were your expectations?

       I felt privileged to be invited to attend Youth Camp. I looked forward to creating memories,
       reaching out to others, showing courage and perseverance, and making friends.

       Did you have any concerns about going to Youth Camp?

15     My ﬁrst thoughts were: we will be spending seven days and nights in the wilderness, where it will
       be freezing cold with creepy crawlies all around. One would think the greatest freedom was being
       away from our parents; after all, we are teenagers. But the thought of managing by myself was
       the real concern.

       Which was the most memorable event, and what did you ﬁnd most difﬁcult?

20     My favourite memory is taking part in a cultural evening; an amazing fusion of ideas and
       diverse cultures. We showed great teamwork, shared ideas and staged a mind-blowing
       cultural concert. The worst was that we were instructed to leave all electronic devices at home.
       It was electronic withdrawal at its best.

       What was the main focus of the camp?

25     The focus of the camp was to gain understanding that everyone has a personal responsibility as
       a South African citizen. I learnt that being a South African citizen carries immense responsibility
       and accountability.

       What could be considered the most important lesson you learnt?

       I understood that no matter who we are, we have the potential to achieve greatness; that one
30     person can change society, even a nation. The camp was a true eye-opener. This opportunity
       has reinforced in all of us that the future success of South Africa lies in our hands. We are tomorrow!

                                             Why Teddy Bears?
            Most people love teddy bears and this does not
            stop when we leave our childhood behind us.

            The British seem particularly fond of their bears
            and in a survey it was discovered that up to
 5          35 % of British adults still take their bears to bed
            with them. These were primarily women who
            kept their bears from childhood, treated them                                                   Image removed for
            like friends, sharing problems with them                                                         copyright reasons
            and cuddling them during bad times.
10          Interestingly, almost 25 % of British
            businessmen admitted that they take
            their teddy bears with them on business
            trips.

            Psychologist Christopher Peterson noticed
15          a similar trend when taking an informal
            survey at one of his lectures: “I asked how
            many students brought stuffed animals with them to college. A large number of
            the 250 students present raised their hands. Thinking I saw a pattern, I asked for
            shows of hands separately by females and males. Indeed, there was a striking
20          pattern. About 80 % of the females had brought a stuffed animal to college, whereas
            fewer than 10 % of the males had done so – or at least admitted to it. But those
            few guys who raised their hands earned applause from their female classmates.”

            There are many psychological reasons for our love of teddy bears. Not only are they
            reminders of our carefree childhoods and of the loved ones who gave the bears to us,
25          but the stroking of the soft fur has also been found to be very therapeutic.

            On cuddling teddy [ – X – ], psychologist Corrine Sweet says that “it [ – 27 – ]
            a sense of peace, security and comfort. Studies have shown that touching a teddy
            bear can [ – 28 – ] stress.” As a result, teddy bears are often given to trauma victims.
            Clinical trials have [ – 29 – ] that cuddling, naming and speaking to a teddy bear
30          comforts people. Various police, fire and paramedic departments routinely provide
            teddy bears for their officers to use when helping [ – 30 – ], lost, and traumatized
            children.
