SOURCE A                Extract from The Rise of Modern Japan by WG Beasley, 1995. WG Beasley is Emeritus
                        professor of the History of the Far East at the University of London, UK.

On the night of 18 September 1931 a bomb exploded on the railway outside Mukden. Troops were
immediately moved to seize the city, and by the next morning the occupation of southern Manchuria
had begun … All this had been done, not only against the known wishes of the Japanese cabinet,
but also without the authority of the army high command … On 21 September 1931 China had appealed
to the League of Nations, leading to a Japanese denial that she had any territorial ambitions in China
and a promise to withdraw her troops. In due course the League appointed a commission of enquiry,
chaired by Lord Lytton, whose members arrived in Yokohama early in 1932, to be met almost at once by
the announcement creating Manchukuo … the report they wrote, while cautious and moderate in its tone,
left little prospect that the League would not support China. When the matter came finally to debate in
Geneva in February 1933, Japan chose to withdraw from the League rather than listen to condemnation.


SOURCE B                Extract from the introduction to The Lytton Report on the Manchurian Crisis,
                        League of Nations Publications, 1932.

Two resolutions were adopted by the Council [of the League of Nations] on 30 September and
10 December 1931. The first one was directed toward the taking of such temporary measures as were
deemed essential to prevent any worsening of the situation growing out of the events at Mukden on
18–19 September 1931. The resolution of 10 December 1931 went beyond the scope of the earlier one in
that it expressed the desire of the Council “to contribute towards a final and fundamental solution by the
two governments of the questions at issue between them”. The Council accordingly decided to appoint a
commission of five members “to study on the spot and to report to the Council on any circumstances which,
affecting international relations, threaten to disturb the peace between China and Japan, or the good
understanding between them upon which peace depends”.

SOURCE C                Extract from “Japan at War: History-writing on the Crisis of the 1930s” by
                        Louise Young, in The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered, 1999.
                        Louise Young is professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, US,
                        specializing in East Asian Studies.

One line of academic study on the Manchurian Incident looks at the diplomatic response of the League
of Nations and the escalating tensions between Japan and the Western powers, including the American
attempt to contain Japan through “moral diplomacy”, the French and British attempts at appeasement,
and the appointment of the Lytton Commission, whose critical report resulted in Japan’s withdrawal from
the League … The second set of studies focuses on … the increasing inflexibility of the Young Marshal
[Zhang Xueliang], the fear of the Chinese nationalist movement spreading to Manchuria and dissatisfaction
with the civilian authorities’ handling of the Manchurian question. These studies highlight the role of Japan’s
garrison force in Manchuria. On the evening of 18 September 1931 several Japanese army officers secretly
exploded a section of the Japanese railway, blamed the explosion on Chinese agitators, and used this as a
pretext to attack the forces of the Young Marshal.


SOURCE D                Extract from a statement made by Lord Lytton to the British House of Lords,
                        2 November 1932. Lord Lytton was the chairman of the League of Nations’
                        Commission of Enquiry into the events in Manchuria.

The first thing I should like to say about the report is that, although it is associated with my name,
any value which it may have is due to the fact that it is an international document. In addition to the
five Commissioners, who were drawn from five different countries, we were assisted in our work by experts
drawn from France, the United States, Holland and Canada, and since our conclusions were unanimous this
report may be regarded as the joint work of the nationals of at least seven different countries. I think the
report gains in value when we remember that it is the work of the nationals of many different countries. …
At the time of our appointment the governments of both China and Japan undertook at the Council of
the League to assist the work of the Commission, and I should like, therefore, to take this opportunity to
state publicly that this undertaking was loyally and thoroughly carried out by both the governments.
We received from both of them very valuable help.
