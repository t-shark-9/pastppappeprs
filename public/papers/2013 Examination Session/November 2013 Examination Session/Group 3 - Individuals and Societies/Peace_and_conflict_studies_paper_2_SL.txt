Answer two questions, each chosen from a different topic.

Topic 2: Social conflict

1.    With reference to at least two examples and using theory drawn from social psychology,
      analyse the link between conformity and violence.


2.    With reference to concepts of cultural and structural violence, and theories drawn from
      social psychology, examine the validity of the statement that “prejudice is a product of ignorance that
      hides behind barriers of tradition”.


3.    Using examples to illustrate your answer, discuss whether social learning theory gives a
      sufficient explanation for human aggression.




Topic 3: Conflict around the globe

4.    With reference to specific examples, analyse the military-industrial complex and how globalization
      has affected it.


5.    To what extent do you agree with the following statement: “Development should be viewed as a
      human rights issue, not as a question of simply increasing the gross national product.”?


6.    Evaluate the role of two of the outside parties in one regional armed conflict, and how successful they
      have been in influencing the behaviour of the core parties in the conflict.
