1.   Explain briefly the meaning of the following terms as used in Source A and Source D:

     (a) Obedience (Source A, line 10).                                                 [2 marks]

          The candidate who makes a superficial attempt to explain the term will gain [0 marks].
          The candidate gains [1 mark] for a sufficient explanation of the term such as
          “complying with a request in a response to vertical pressure”. The candidate will gain
          another [1 mark] for a reference to the document with an additional analysis, such as an
          explanation of how obedience to an authority such as a government is a personal choice
          and can be withdrawn. Candidates who meet the one mark response but also make
          reference to Peace and Conflict theory, such as how society’s acceptance of blind
          obedience can be considered a form of cultural violence, or how Gene Sharp’s Theory
          of Power explains obedience, can also achieve [2 marks].

     (b) Asymmetric conflict (Source D, title).                                         [2 marks]

          The candidate who simply rephrases the term (eg “A conflict that is asymmetric”)
          will gain [0 marks]. The candidate will gain [1 mark] for a brief explanation of
          the term, such as a conflict in which one party is more powerful than the other.
          The candidate will gain [2 marks] for demonstrating a more thorough understanding of
          the term, for example by using the document to explain how asymmetric conflict
          can become symmetric, or by referring to Peace and Conflict theory (eg by explaining
          the options an underdog has in confronting a top dog).


2.   With reference to post-conflict peacebuilding, analyse the statement “Stop the
     killing, we want to build a homeland for all Syrians.” (Source B, line 5). [4 marks]

     [1 mark] will be awarded for a superficial attempt to answer the question. Answers
     that indicate understanding of the term “peacebuilding” and how violence makes it
     more difficult to overcome hatred will gain [2 marks]. For [3 marks], the candidate
     will analyse the statement in the context of how creating negative peace (“stop the
     killing”) serves as a foundation from which deeper-rooted issues, such as prejudice
     and discrimination, can be addressed through peacebuilding.     [4 marks] will be
     awarded for an exemplary answer, showing a deeper understanding of how the
     methods used during conflict will affect the attempts to create positive peace
     through post-conflict peacebuilding, for example, by referring to Gandhi’s concept
     of ahimsa.

3.   Compare and contrast the opinions expressed about the conflict in Syria in
     Source B and Source C.                                                            [4 marks]

     Answers should focus on significant comparisons and contrasts between Sources B and C in
     their analysis of the Syrian conflict.

     [1 mark] will be awarded for a superficial attempt to answer the question. Answers that only
     mention comparisons, or only contrasts, will receive a maximum of [2 marks].

     For [2 marks], the candidate will mention the main comparison and contrast between Source
     B and C. The main comparison is that both sources acknowledge that Assad is using his
     forces to attack peaceful protesters. The main contrast is that Source C argues that violent
     protest is the most effective approach to the Assad regime, whereas Source B argues that
     non-violent protest is the most sensible option.

     For [3 marks] the candidate will mention at least two comparisons and two contrasts between
     these sources.

     [4 marks] will be awarded for an exemplary answer, showing a deep understanding of the
     interrelations of the two sources.
                                               –5–            N13/3/PCONS/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   With reference to all four sources and drawing from your own knowledge,
     examine the extent to which the strategy and objectives of non-violent
     protest are different to those of violent protest.                                   [8 marks]

     This is a mini-essay. Candidates should compare the strategy and objectives of non-violent
     protest with those of violent protest. They could argue, based on Sources B and C, that the
     strategy is different (the use of violence or not), but the objectives of both approaches are
     quite similar and both expect to be successful in their approach. Source A indicates that the
     objective of non-violent protest is to remove the military support for the regime, whereas the
     objective of the violent protest of Source C is to replace the regime by its own military.
     Source D could be used to argue that both approaches have the strategy to confront the
     oppressor (stage 2), but that with non-violent protest the strategy of non-violence is connected
     with its objective of more peaceful negotiations (stage 3) and positive peace in the future
     (stage 4).

     Answers that use only own knowledge or only information from the sources can receive a
     maximum of [4 marks]. Answers that only analyse strategy or objectives can receive a
     maximum of [4 marks].

     For [1–2 marks], the candidate must examine these issues superficially.

     For [3–4 marks] the candidate must answer the question with satisfactory, but limited,
     arguments or with little reference to the sources.

     [5–6 marks] will be awarded if the candidate analyses the strategy and objectives of
     non-violent and violent protest in a relevant and accurate way. The candidate must develop a
     solid thesis followed by a compelling and relevant argument.

     [7–8 marks] will be given if the candidate offers deeper insight beyond these references.
     Full marks can also be awarded to answers that challenge the assumptions made in one or
     more of the sources in a profound way, showing insights beyond the demands of the question.
