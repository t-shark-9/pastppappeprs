                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    economies of scale (line 16)                                                   [2 marks]

                  Economies of scale refer to the decrease in cost per unit produced, as the
                  total scale of the production facility increases.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding, with reference to both decrease in cost per unit and increase
                  in scale of production.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   empowerment (line 35).                                                         [2 marks]

                  Empowerment is a form of non-financial reward and a motivational
                  technique; it means that some power is given to employees so they can
                  make some of their own decisions regarding their working life (for instance
                  they may have control over how to use their time and decide which tasks
                  could be done from home).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above with reference to decision making.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].
                                            –6–              N13/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   With reference to RDB, distinguish between internal growth and external
      growth.                                                                 [4 marks]

      Internal growth (also called organic growth) refers to the growth of a business
      (RDB in this case) through increasing sales (for example, developing first-mover
      advantage in the market for “technologically advanced, energy-efficient ball
      bearings” (lines 95–96)) or developing marketing activities (hence Anna’s idea of
      using “engineers-turned-salesmen” (line 116)). Internal growth is also possible by
      cutting costs and selling goods at a lower price, thereby increasing market share,
      though there is no reference to this in the case study.

      External growth takes place through external solutions, such as joint ventures and
      mergers and acquisitions. Valdemar suggested strategic alliances which would be
      a form of external growth with companies based in Brazil, China and India.
      Strategic alliances would enable RDB to operate or at least sell directly in those
      countries, without having to develop its own marketing activities there.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for a basic definition of each type of growth. Award another
      [1 mark] for an application to RDB up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             –7–              N13/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of each new RDB factory being
      “jointly managed by one experienced RDB senior manager from Europe and
      one local manager familiar with the language and culture” (lines 100–101). [7 marks]

      Advantages include the following:
       the factories will benefit from having two managers who combine forces
        (in terms of synergy, when adding the experience of the European RDB senior
        manager and the field knowledge of the newly appointed local manager)
       having two complementary managers avoids the problem of RDB headquarters
        having to decide who to appoint as a sole manager: on their own, expats from
        northern Europe might struggle to be accepted and respected; on their own,
        newly appointed local managers might not appreciate the RDB culture of
        high-quality ball bearings
       for RDB as a whole, this means a more diverse workforce, which is in line with
        Anna’s ideas about reflecting customers’ profiles; diversity in the workforce is
        often seen as a vector of creativity; it is also more politically correct and it
        seems that Anna has that agenda too
       communication between head office and managers, and managers and employees
       accept any other relevant advantage.

      Disadvantages include the following:
       the two managers, being from different cultural backgrounds, could be
        prejudiced against each other, or could have different values and attitudes, which
        might create tension or conflict between them and hinder communication
        between them
       the two managers may have different management/leadership styles, which
        could be confusing for the employees, for example if one is more autocratic
        and the other more democratic
       the two managers may have different ideas about quality control, operations or
        marketing, which could slow the decision-making process in the factories
       accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      Candidates are not expected to refer to all of the above points for top marks,
      but their analysis must be balanced in order to reach the highest level of
      the markband.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   By the 1970s, Japanese companies had moved to just-in-time production
           (line 26). Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of just-in-time
           production.                                                           [4 marks]

           Advantages of just-in-time production stock control include:
            it improves the working capital cycle (as the companies only produce the ball
             bearings that have been ordered: they do not keep stock, so there is no capital
             “blocked” in the form of stock)
            it reduces storage costs (unlike with a just-in-case approach)
            it reduces the chances of holding unsellable stock (if business customers change
             specification or requirements)
            accept any other relevant advantage.

           Disadvantages of just-in-time production stock control include:
            unlike with a just-in-case approach, sudden large orders cannot be met (as there
             is no stock), so customers could then turn to competitors
            if the suppliers also operate on a just-in-time basis, it can create some delays
            accept any other relevant disadvantage.

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           N.B. Accept answers that only refer to just-in-time stock control.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant advantage/disadvantage identified, award an
           additional [1 mark] for the development of that advantage/disadvantage up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Using data from the additional information on page 3, calculate RDB’s:

           (i)    gross profit margin in 1970 and 1975.                                         [2 marks]

(c)   Interpret the results from your calculations in part (b).                               [7 marks]

      The gross profit margin of RDB declined significantly between 1970 and 1975,
      falling from 53.39 % to 43.90 % . Profitability from the manufacturing process
      declined. In the case study, mention is made of intensifying competition from
      Japanese manufacturers. In all likelihood, as Japanese firms became more fierce
      competitors, companies such as RDB had to lower sales prices of its products.
      With lower sales prices, the gross profit margin contracted.

      With the decline in profitability but with expanding operations, RDB’s liquidity
      weakened – though it was still strong. The acid test ratio fell from 2.75 times in
      1970 to 2.31 times in 1975. The expanded operations meant that RDB had to
      commit greater funds to support its growth thus decreasing liquidity.

      It is arguable that RDB’s acid test ratio was too high (that it had too much money
      tied up in low-yielding assets and that the decrease in the acid test ratio was
      actually a positive development).

      In isolation, the decline in gross profit margin is a negative development,
      the slight deterioration in liquidity less so. However, as part of a long-term trend,
      these developments were worrisome.

      Accept any other relevant interpretation.


      Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR) from calculations made in part (b).

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3. The balance
      required for higher marks means that both profitability and liquidity ratios need to
      be interpreted.

3.   (a)   Describe one consequence of the likely relocation of the factories
           (lines 96–99):

           (i)    for one internal stakeholder of RDB.                                              [2 marks]

                  An example of one internal stakeholder that would be affected by the
                  relocation is the workforce in the Swedish megafactory: as RDB would be
                  closing their workplace, many would be laid off. Some might be offered
                  jobs in the new factories (for example, some of the senior managers) but the
                  majority of workers’ jobs would be made redundant and the workers
                  themselves would become unemployed.

                  Accept any other relevant internal stakeholder with a description.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description of the consequence; award an
                  additional [1 mark] for the development of that point, up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks]. Award [0 marks] if the stakeholder is not internal or is not
                  precisely identified.

           (ii)   for one external stakeholder of RDB.                                              [2 marks]

                  An example of one external stakeholder that would be affected by the
                  relocation is the Swedish government: firstly, they would lose all the
                  business rates (taxes) paid by RDB; secondly, they would see an increase in
                  unemployment in the towns that were dependent on RDB (for direct and
                  indirect jobs); thirdly, as “the Swedish factory was so large that railroad
                  lines had been installed in order to deliver supplies and to transport finished
                  products” (lines 139–140), the Swedish government might try to put
                  pressure on RDB to keep the factory there.

                  Accept any other relevant external stakeholder with a description.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description of the consequence; award an
                  additional [1 mark] for the development of that point, up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks]. Award [0 marks] if the stakeholder is not external or is not
                  precisely identified.

(b)   Using information in lines 19–21, construct a position map of the ball bearing
      industry in the 1930s and place RDB and its two main competitors on it.        [4 marks]




      Award [1 mark] for the overall layout of the position map with both axes
      correctly labelled (quality and price) and high/low clearly indicated. N.B. it does
      not matter which axis is horizontal/vertical.
      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of RDB in the quadrant “high quality and
      high price”.
      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of UAB at the centre of the model
      (to show “medium quality and medium price”).
      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of FIB in the quadrant “low quality and
      low price”.

(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for RDB of becoming a public
      limited company (line 123).                                           [7 marks]

      Becoming a public limited company means that RDB shares would traded on the
      stock market. By selling shares to the general public, they would be able to
      rapidly raise more funds, hence Anna’s keenness, as that extra capital is essential
      to implement her “RDB 2020” vision. Supporting further expansion by changing
      status from a private to a public limited company is a common method to raise
      capital – however there are several disadvantages. RDB’s audited accounts would
      have to be released to the public, but more importantly RDB would become
      vulnerable to takeover bids and the Holstein family would also lose some control
      and ownership (hence Valdemar’s resistance). Moreover, the value of RDB shares
      may also be very dependent upon stock exchange fluctuations.

                                             SECTION B

4.   (a)   Outline why ball bearings are particularly important in the secondary sector
           of the economy.                                                              [2 marks]

           The secondary sector of the economy is about manufacturing (for example, the
           construction of cars and vehicles) – and this type of engineering often requires
           ball bearings (both in the car factories and in the cars themselves).


           Candidates are not expected to answer exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic answer (for example an answer that only defines
           secondary sector without explicit reference to ball bearings in manufacturing).

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear answer that conveys knowledge and understanding
           similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Describe an autocratic leadership style.                                             [2 marks]

           An autocratic leadership style is one where the leader wants to hold on to as much
           power, authority and control as possible, without delegating and without
           consulting the employees who are just expected to obey.


           Candidates are not expected to answer exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic description that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding by making one valid point about autocratic leadership style.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear description that conveys knowledge and
           understanding by making two or more valid points.

           For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].
                                             – 13 –            N13/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain Valdemar Holstein’s suggestion of hiring local salesmen who would
      be “paid low salaries, but with high commissions as an incentive”
      (lines 152–153).                                                          [4 marks]

      Valdemar has become aware of the importance of having a more diverse
      workforce, especially regarding the salespeople working in the field in Brazil,
      China, and India, visiting potential customers to try to generate orders from them.
      That salesforce needs to have knowledge of the local languages and cultures; to
      motivate them, Valdemar suggests a system of commissions ie besides a small,
      basic salary, they would receive a commission (typically calculated as a
      percentage) of the value of the business they create for RDB. This would be an
      incentive for them (because the more orders they get, the more they earn) and it
      would eventually benefit RDB too – a win-win solution.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Award [1 mark] for each basic point; award an additional [1 mark] for the
      development of that point, up to a maximum of [4 marks].

(d)   With reference to RDB, distinguish between primary research and secondary
      research.                                                                 [4 marks]

      Primary research is carried out by staff from RDB’s marketing department, who
      could be carrying out surveys or interviews from existing customers (or potential
      customers) to find out about their satisfaction level (to identify areas of
      improvement, for example after-sales service), about the image they have of RDB
      (to create a perception map), or about their specific needs (to develop new
      products if necessary).

      Secondary research (also called desk research) means using existing materials
      (published in professional journals, in the media, by consultants, etc); although the
      information is not directly about RDB, it can be useful by providing a background
      picture (for example, about trends in the demand for greener or more energy-
      efficient ball bearings, or about ball bearings adapted to the needs of the design
      community).

      Accept any other relevant point.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each definition (primary research, secondary research);
      award an additional [1 mark] for the application to RDB (giving an example with
      reference to RDB) up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(e)   Discuss the relative merits of producing ball bearings in small factories as
      opposed to the three European megafactories.                                 [8 marks]

      Megafactories have several merits, especially economies of scale (in different parts
      of the organization, for example managerial economies of scale, or getting
      discounts from suppliers or minimizing transport costs). The existing megafactories
      are also well established in their local environments with loyal workers who are
      clearly committed to the ongoing success of RDB (and may consequently be
      more productive). These workers are also highly skilled: RDB expertise (a tradition
      that is almost 100 years old!) is linked to the megafactories that seem very well
      suited for mass production (line production).

      Small factories however have merits too, especially in terms of flexibility: the
      case study stresses the fact that the Japanese competitors of the 1970s became
      successful thanks to their flexibility – and RDB does not seem as flexible, which
      is not surprising as it based on a different factory model (where configurations
      cannot be as easily modified and adapted). Small factories may be better suited
      for job production (for example, for one-off orders) or even for batch production.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      N.B. This question is not about offshoring, location and relocation: the focus is
           on size (small factories versus megafactories).

      It does not matter which conclusion candidates reach at the end of their discussion
      (ie whether it is better to produce ball bearings in small or large factories),
      however for top marks there must be a final conclusion.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
