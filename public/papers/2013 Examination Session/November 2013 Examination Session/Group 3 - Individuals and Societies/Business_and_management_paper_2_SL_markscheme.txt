                                                SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Define the term private sector.                                                     [2 marks]

                  The private sector (also called commercial sector) refers to those areas of the
                  economy mostly owned and run by private individuals, partnerships and
                  corporations, typically for a profit. Organizations in the private sector are not
                  controlled by the state. The private sector exists/operates in contrast to the
                  public sector, which are organizations majority owned and run by local,
                  regional/provincial, and national governments.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge
                  and understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   Identify two advantages for BF of operating as a private limited
                  company.                                                         [2 marks]

                  Advantages for BF of operating as a private limited company could include:
                   limited liability of the owners
                   it allows continuity in the event of the death of one of the principals/
                    principal shareholders
                   ownership of the company can be more easily transferred
                   shares could provide an additional source of compensation
                   with a private limited company, there is a convenient legal structure
                    (selling shares) to raise additional equity capital
                   banks, trade creditors, and other external sources of finance are generally
                    more inclined to lend money/provide finance to private limited companies.


                  Award [1 mark] for each correct and relevant advantage for BF of operating
                  as a private limited company identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      Award marks as follows:

      [1 mark] for each appropriately labelled axis – award up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].
      [1 mark] for an appropriately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.
      [1 mark] for an appropriately drawn and labelled total costs curve.
      [1 mark] for the identification of the break-even level of output.

      Award [0 marks] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than [3 marks]
      if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to scale. If a
      candidate produces a chart with no figures (which prevents determination if it is
      to scale) but in other respects it is fully accurate, award a maximum of [3 marks].

      Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the break-even point and
      label the arrow. However, accept as an “appropriately labelled” break-even point
      a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point provided that the line is
      labelled “break-even point”.

(d)   Examine one factor that might improve employee motivation and one factor
      that might worsen employee motivation if BF moves to a building in the
      industrial park in Belluno.                                              [5 marks]

      Factors that might improve employee motivation include:
       possible extra financial rewards
       growth and possible increased professionalization and visibility of business
       evidence that Antonio is thinking about the long-term health of the business
       accept any other relevant positive factor.

      Factors that might worsen employee motivation include:
       move from small town where people live
       increased commute time/costs
       slight decrease in the face-to-face feel of the business
       expectation that they produce more frames per month
       accept any other relevant negative factor.

      Overall, the move to Belluno represents a form of modernization of BF. In many
      ways, this transition will be de-motivating for the reasons identified above.
      On the other hand, Antonio’s moves show that he is concerned about the
      long-term viability of his family’s business and is taking the necessary steps for
      BF to be successful in the future, which could give comfort and satisfaction to
      the employees.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      N.B. Balance means that the candidate has considered both factors that improve
           and worsen employee motivation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(c)   Comment on your results to part (b).                                                   [3 marks]

      Both investment options, purchasing 10 motorcycles or 5 cars, are attractive
      investment options, with payback periods of 3 years (motorcycles) and 3 years and
      5 (or 4.46) months (cars) and ARRs of 16.67 % (motorcycles) and 13.94% (cars).
      The difference in ARRs is material. If no other factors were involved, it would
      clearly be better to invest in motorcycles. Over time, a 2.73% difference in
      investment returns (the difference between 16.67 % and 13.94% ) is substantial.
      There is also a difference in the payback period, indicating that the motorcycles
      are a better investment. However, these forecasted returns are just that, forecasts,
      and actual returns may vary.


      Award [1 mark] if the candidate recognizes that the motorcycles represent the
      better investment. Award [2 marks] if the candidate recognizes that the
      motorcycles represent the better investment and explains in numerate terms why.
      Award [3 marks] if the candidate recognizes that the motorcycles represent the
      better investment, explains in numerate terms why, and provides some other
      relevant comment (other factors could influence the investment decision, these
      investment appraisals are based upon forecasts and that actual returns could
      differ, etc). Award up to a maximum of [3 marks].

(d)   Analyse whether NTB should purchase the 10 motorcycles (Option 1) or the
      5 cars (Option 2).                                                       [5 marks]

      NTB’s decision whether to purchase motorcycles or cars probably depends on (1)
      the organization’s commitment to social responsibility, (2) Chinh’s concerns over
      increasing the scale of his business, and (3) Chinh’s long-term vision. Based upon
      the information provided, the motorcycles have a better average rate of return.
      However, from the point of view of social responsibility, NTB should purchase
      the cars. Though they consume petrol, they are much quieter than the motorcycles.
      In addition, Chinh will have far less paperwork than with the motorcycles, which
      rent on a daily basis.

      From an investment point of view, the reason that NTB has a lower rate of return
      from the cars is the lower profits in first year, when the organization is trying
      to establish its identity in the car rental market. Once it is established, Chinh
      predicts no problem offering car rental and the rate of return will improve to what
      he would have on motorcycles. Thus, if Chinh can accept the slightly lower rate
      in the first year, he will soon be making as much with cars as with motorcycles,
      the scale of his business will not be as large as with motorcycles, and he can
      appease the pressure group in Nha Trang.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      N.B. If the candidate fails to use figures in their argument, award a maximum
           of [3 marks].

(b)   With reference to Anigam, distinguish between above the line and below the
      line promotion.                                                            [4 marks]

      “Above the line promotion” refers to forms of advertising in a newspaper, on the
      internet, on television and on the radio where the business (in this case: Anigam)
      is not entirely responsible for the process, as another organization controls
      the process. For example, Anigam could advertise Anislim through short
      commercials on television and on YouTube, showing animals that are losing weight
      at the same time as their owners.

      “Below the line promotion” refers to methods of promotion where the business
      (in this case: Anigam) is in direct contact with customers (for example, through
      loyalty cards, point of sale displays, direct marketing, even public relations).
      As Anitox is sold B2B to veterinary clinics, Anigam is very likely to use below
      the line promotion with the vets it targets.


      N.B. Candidates are not expected to word their answer exactly as above.

      [1 to 2 marks]
      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some basic knowledge of the
      definitions of “above the line” and “below the line” promotion. Award [2 marks]
      for a theoretical answer that shows clear knowledge of the difference between
      “above the line” and “below the line” promotion.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      Award [3 marks] for a clear answer that is not just theoretical, but applies the
      concepts to Anigam. Award [4 marks] for a thorough answer that applies the
      concepts to Anigam and explicitly shows the difference between “above the line”
      and “below the line” promotion, with reference to different products of Anigam.

(c)   Explain one reason why a promotional mix chosen by Anigam might fail.                [2 marks]

      A promotional mix is a combination of different methods of promotion with
      specific targets. Anigam’s promotional mix may fail if the chosen methods do not
      properly target the intended segments, for example as Anitox is sold B2B to
      veterinary clinics, it would be inappropriate to target individual animal owners
      through television adverts, as they are not the ones who decide which drugs are
      used in their veterinary clinic. Likewise, a system of loyalty cards or regular
      purchase coupons would be inappropriate for Aniplus, as it would suggest that the
      drug does not work well, if customers are expected to buy it regularly.


      Do not credit elements of an answer about the marketing mix (the 4Ps or 7Ps),
      as the question is about a promotional mix, not a marketing mix.

      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some basic knowledge of the definition
      and/or purpose of a promotional mix.

      Award [2 marks] for an answer that explains one reason why a promotional mix
      chosen by Anigam might fail.

(d)   Analyse Anigam’s portfolio of animal drugs by applying the Boston consulting
      group (BCG) matrix.                                                          [5 marks]

      The BCG matrix distinguishes between four types of products according to
      their market share and to the growth rate of the market in which they are sold.

                                                    Relative Market Share
                                        High
                                                 High                 Low




                                                 Stars            Question marks
                   Market Growth Rate

                                        Low




                                               Cash cows              Dogs




      The Anigam portfolio of products lends itself well to a BCG matrix:
       Anitox is a cash cow (it “has a high 25% share of the global market” and
        the market is “growing very slowly”)
       Anisan is a star (“it already has a high 15% share of a rapidly growing
        market”)
       Aniplus is a question mark (the market “is growing rapidly” however it
        seemingly has a low market share, as it is not performing well)
       Anislim is not a perfect fit for the BCG matrix; it is too early to tell whether it
        will become a star, a question mark, or a dog.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      If the candidate presents the matrix theoretically, award up to [2 marks].
      Award [1 mark] for a basic presentation of the model with a minor error or
      omission, or poor labelling; award [2 marks] for a correct and accurate
      presentation of the model.

      N.B. For [5 marks], the candidate must demonstrate thorough knowledge of the
           BCG matrix and accurately address all four products.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(e)   With reference to Anigam and one other company of your choice, discuss
      reasons for the increase in the number of multinational companies.     [7 marks]

      “Positive” reasons for the increase in the number of multinational companies
      include the following:
       strategies of market development (to use a concept from the Ansoff matrix),
         when national markets are saturated
       potential growth in some foreign markets that are still untapped/available
       cost-saving (being closer to global customers and/or to cheaper labour and/or
         cheaper raw materials)
       differentiation from competitors
       exploitation of a brand name already popular, with market research showing
         potential
       financial motivation: taxes may be lower in some foreign markets
       accept any other relevant positive reason.

      “Negative” reasons for the increase in the number of multinational companies
      include the following:
       saturation within host-country market
       consolidation within a company’s industry is forcing companies to find means
         to grow
       government legislation or regulation within the home country are limiting
         domestic sales
       being forced to offshore as a means to reduce costs
       accept any other relevant negative reason.

      Accept any other relevant discussion of the reasons identified.


      N.B. To achieve more than [5 marks], candidates must include explicit examples
           of multinational companies (such as Starbucks®, Subway®, etc).

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

4.   (a)   Describe flow production in the context of a fast food restaurant such
           as Zeitim.                                                             [2 marks]

           Flow production (also known as mass production and line production) is the
           production of high volumes of standardized products using a continuous flow
           (with the image of an assembly line in a factory).

           In the context of a fast food restaurant such as Zeitim, flow production looks like a
           series of employees, in line, each adding one element to the food being prepared,
           eg for a sandwich: one worker slices the bread, one worker adds vegetables,
           another one adds some sauce, etc.


           N.B. Candidates are not expected to word their answer exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a theoretical answer that shows knowledge of the definition
           of flow production.

           Award [2 marks] for an answer that describes the process.

     (b)   With reference to Zeitim and other organizations of your choice, explain three
           ways in which businesses can differentiate their products from their
           competitors’.                                                                  [6 marks]

           Product differentiation can be achieved in the following ways:
            the product is radically different from competitors (eg the first iPads, iPods,
              iPhones)
            the product has minor yet unique differences (eg KFC®’s “original recipe”
              making its fried chicken taste slightly differently from its competitors)
            product specification (eg some clothing retailers specialize in very large
              sizes only)
            product portfolio (eg some bookshops have differentiated themselves by
              including a coffee shop on site, or by stocking books on specialized topics such
              as gardening or foreign literature)
            the product may be very similar, but branding ensures a difference of
              perception in customers’ minds (eg many fast food restaurants sell similar
              products, but only some are branded Zeitim or McDonald’s®).

           Accept any other relevant explanation.


           Mark as 2 + 2 + 2.

           For each valid method of product differentiation: award [1 mark] for a theoretical
           answer that shows knowledge of the method of product differentiation, award
           [2 marks] for an answer that explains the method (which could be through an
           example), ie providing both “theory” and “practice”.

(c)   Examine how branding may have contributed to the success of
      Zeitim restaurants.                                         [5 marks]

      Branding is a marketing strategy: it is about creating a name that potential
      customers will recognize and remember (brand awareness). Zeitim has creatively
      developed its own branding around the amusing use of the letter Z
      (“Zeitim Zalads”, “Zeitim Zandwiches”, “Zeitim Zmoothy”). This may have
      contributed to the success of Zeitim restaurants because customers learn to
      recognize the Zeitim range of products, both because of the underpinning humour
      and because of the uniqueness of the family brand (as with the “Mc” range at
      McDonalds®: McChicken Sandwich®, Chicken McNuggets®, McMuffin®, etc).
      In turn, this brand development may have contributed to brand loyalty; as the
      Zeitim products are highly standardized (flow production), customers know what
      to expect, even when they travel (to Asia and the Middle East), hence the success
      of Zeitim restaurants not only in high streets and shopping areas, but also in train
      stations and airports.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      N.B. To receive top marks (according to the generic markbands on page 3),
           a candidate must have some balance in their answer. If a candidate explains
           that factors other than branding may have contributed to Zeitim’s success,
           that is sufficient for “balance”.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   With reference to Zeitim and one other organization of your choice, discuss
      the use of franchising as a growth strategy.                                [7 marks]

      Franchising is often used as an external growth strategy. For franchisors, it is a
      means of rapid expansion (which was the case of Zeitim) with franchisees
      providing most of the finance (as opposed to internal growth, requiring capital to
      buy or rent premises). When the franchise model works, there are large profits to
      be made from royalty/copyright payments (on the marketing use of the brand
      name) and possibly from selling raw materials and equipment. There are also
      many advantages for the franchisee, who receives support from the franchisor
      (eg through marketing and staff training) and may benefit from the well-known
      brand name (or at least from a successful model of production or distribution).
      This is why franchising has been used in the restaurant industry by so many
      international companies such as McDonald’s®, Starbucks®, KFC® and
      Pizza Hut®.

      Franchising, however, has limitations and disadvantages, especially for the
      franchisee. It can be very expensive (not only in terms of start-up costs, but also
      as the franchisee may have to pay a percentage of profit to the franchisor, which
      may substantially cut the profit margin). Besides, the franchisor has little or no
      flexibility (for example a Zeitim restaurant may not be allowed to decide what
      drinks it sells, what advertising it does or what colour is chosen to repaint the
      walls). For the franchisor, using franchising as a growth strategy requires having
      high level of structures in place and tight control over the franchisees’ operations,
      as a negative story about one of them (eg about lack of hygiene) would affect the
      whole brand.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      N.B. To achieve more than [5 marks], candidates must include explicit examples
           of franchises (they may be national ones, this is acceptable as the question
           does not ask for international examples).

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

           The term dividends refers to payments made to shareholders from a company
           out of its profits, typically sometime after the close of an accounting period
           (quarter or year). The board of directors of the company will determine the
           payout rate as a fixed amount per share and, thus, each individual shareholder’s
           portion of the distribution corresponds to their proportion of the shares.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and

(b)   Explain the advantages for WV of operating both non-profit and profit-based
      shops.                                                                      [6 marks]

      The advantages for WV of operating non-profit shops are that it gives the
      organization the legitimate right to claim their mission of doing good: providing
      programmes, services, and products that are of public benefit. In the case of WV,
      villages in developing countries receive crucial economic benefit, as artisans can
      remain in the villages rather than migrate to other places for lucrative work,
      traditional skills are preserved, thus protecting the indigenous culture of these
      villages, consumers in developed countries like the United States are made more
      aware of markets and people in developing countries. As a result, in its non-profit
      shops WV can enjoy:
       the marketing advantages that come with being a non-profit shop (often free
         publicity, and favourable word-of-mouth)
       the human resource benefits that come with being a non-profit shop – generally
         easy to recruit staff and many are highly motivated
       tax-free status, at least on portions of its income that derive from the non-profit
         shops – governments typically do not tax the income of non-profit organizations
       accept any other relevant advantage for WV of operating non-profit shops.

      The advantages of operating profit-based shops include:
       the organization can grow faster than it probably otherwise would and draw on
        the energy and enthusiasm of entrepreneurs
       as a larger organization, WV may enjoy some economies of scale
       because of the profit imperative (and because WV would in some fashion have to
        be responsive to its profit-based franchisees), the profit-based shops would
        probably be more attentive to market conditions
       accept any other relevant advantage for WV of operating profit-based shops.


      Mark as 3 + 3.

(c)   With reference to WV, analyse the roles of a mission statement and a
      vision statement.                                                    [5 marks]

      A mission statement states the fundamental purpose of the organization. It defines
      critical processes and allows the firm and customers to know the meaningful and
      measurable criteria of the firm, thus allowing some understanding of the desired
      level of performance. A vision statement is more abstract. It outlines what the
      organization wants to be, or how it wants the world in which it operates to be.
      It concentrates on the future. It is a source of inspiration.

      Both mission and vision statements provide clear decision-making criteria.
      Because WV’s mission and vision powerfully outline socially responsible objectives,
      the mission and vision statements are crucially important tools providing guidance.
      The organization’s commitment to helping artisans, fair practices, environmental
      friendliness and green processes is constantly being challenged by merely the fact
      that the global economic downturn is putting pressure on artisans and franchisees to
      lower costs and/or offer products not fully consistent with the mission of the
      organization.

(d)   Discuss whether Yvonne should allow artisans to use “non-environmentally
      friendly materials in their products” to cut costs.                      [7 marks]

      Although for some organizations, the question of whether to “go green” is open,
      for a company such as WV, it is less so. Making some compromises on materials
      would not entirely work with the organization’s commitment to “Making the
      world a village by supporting local artisans”. And, perhaps, some might argue that
      making artisanal products available, even if artisans are using non-environmentally
      friendly materials, is still laudable. Nonetheless, once compromises are made, the
      company’s commitment to eco-friendliness would be weakened and could lead to
      further erosion of its vision and mission. Moreover, the organization would open
      itself to charges of hypocrisy by any competitors who were not making such
      compromises. To be consistent with both the vision statement and the mission
      statement of the organization, WV must continue to strive to live by its principles.

      On the other hand, the downturn of the global economy has probably put real
      pressure on WV and its franchises, and perhaps the only justification for making
      compromises would be if the very existence of the organization were at stake.
      Depending on the franchise agreement, Yvonne may not have full control over the
      products the franchises sell. Even if she does, she might not, practically speaking,
      have the power to monitor their activities. If the franchisees are in jeopardy of
      going out of business, some owners may do whatever they can to stay open and
      face whatever consequences Yvonne may try to impose.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      N.B. For [6 or 7 marks], the candidate must address at least two advantages or
           “pros” and two disadvantages or “cons”.
