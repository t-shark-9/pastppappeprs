          Mexican peso with respect to the USD or some other major currency with
          the demand for pesos increasing and shifting to the right or for providing an
          explanation that since interest rates in developed countries are low, savers
          sell their currencies and buy the Mexican peso to save in Mexican financial
          institutions, thus increasing the demand for pesos and leading to peso
          appreciation.

          For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram for the
          Mexican peso with respect to the USD or some other major currency with
          the demand for pesos increasing and shifting to the right and for providing

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of [3 marks].

          the right and a new higher level of real output or for explaining that (net)

          increases aggregate demand and thus real domestic output.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
       benefits of a currency appreciation:
        - reduced costs of imported inputs (paragraph )
        - domestic industry could be more competitive due to cheaper inputs
           (paragraph  and ) eg car companies
        - domestic exporters must be more price competitive (paragraph )
        - domestic producers must be more price competitive to be able to compete
           with cheaper imports. Forced firms such as Hernandez’s to be more
           competitive. As a result his “company’s hard-won competitiveness” means
           that he can survive the stronger peso for some time. (paragraph )
        - less pressure on inflation
        - possible improvement in living standards from cheaper imports
       costs of a currency appreciation:
        - exporters find it more difficult to compete because of higher export prices
           (paragraph )
        - domestic firms struggle to compete with foreign imports (paragraph )
        - balance of payment current account deficit
        - domestic tourist industry struggles
        - a decrease in employment in export industries
        - a decrease in unemployment in domestic industries competing with imports
        - reduced economic growth

 exports did not fall despite appreciation of the peso (paragraph ).
 Mexico is part of NAFTA - world’s largest FTA (paragraph ) – trade
  creation – exports still relatively competitive despite appreciation of currency
 appreciation has not hurt Mexico as much as it could have as China (Mexico’s
  main competitor (paragraph ) has experienced rising wage rates
 the appreciation may be self-correcting in a floating exchange rate system, so
  will not have a large impact in the long run
 the value of the peso has risen less fast than other Latin American currencies
  and so there is less impact
Any reasonable evaluation.

  - “Governments have started to give domestic firms an advantage over their
     foreign competitors” (paragraph ) - e.g. – subsidies - opportunity cost
     involved
  - protectionism may expand to include capital/financial controls
  - deadweight loss associated with protectionism
 the short-term benefits of trade protection could be outweighed by the
  long-term loss of competitiveness (paragraph ) and misallocation of
  resources.

          For explaining that since GNI per capita is similar in Moldova and India,
          this means that Moldova must have a higher value for life expectancy and/or
          mean years of schooling (or school enrolment/literacy – previous measure)

 interventionist supply-side policies (investment in health and education,
  industrial policies) can result in growth with development, improvements in
  quality of life, improved income distribution (paragraph )
 market-oriented supply-side policies may result in growth with increasing
  poverty and worsening income distribution - inequality increase by 14 %
  (paragraph )
 importance of improved income distribution for growth with development
  (paragraph )
 for growth with development need growth policies that address the causes of
  poverty (increased employment opportunities, investments in human capital,
  etc)
 even growth of 10 % per year (paragraph ) is unlikely to reduce poverty and
  improve standards of living if growth policies are not inclusive/aimed at
  poverty alleviation (investments in human capital, micro-credit for the poor,
  income redistribution policies, increased property rights, increased
  wages/improved labour conditions, improved human rights)
 growth may result in negative externalities which may lead to a lower quality
  of life.

Any reasonable examination.
