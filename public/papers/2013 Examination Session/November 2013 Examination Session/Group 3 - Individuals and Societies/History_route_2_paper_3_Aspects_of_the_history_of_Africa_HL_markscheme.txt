Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
        structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more than
        poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in quality
        and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but underdeveloped. The
        question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is present
        but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited
        argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
        place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at
        a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered. Knowledge
        is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally placed in context,
        and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt
        at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the
        views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound
        understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
        approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present, but not always
        consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the question,
        and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is used
        convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and
        contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
        and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-developed and
        supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may challenge
        it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high level of
        conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
        historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated
        into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

 Following a review of marking practices it has been agreed that in order to add further clarity to the
 markschemes for Paper 3, all caveats with regard to the awarding of marks for questions that include more
 than one component (eg, compare and contrast; reasons and significance; methods and success) will be
 removed.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best fit’ to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Pre-colonial African states (Eastern and Central Africa) 1840–1900

1.   Compare and contrast the rise of Unyamwezi under Mirambo and the Hehe under Mkwawa.

     In comparing the rise of the two groups under Mirambo and Mkwawa, it is important to note that
     both leaders were greatly influenced by the Ngoni. The rise of the two groups greatly depended on
     the military techniques which they borrowed from the Ngoni. These included the use of the short
     stabbing spear, big shields, etc. Economically they both traded more on ivory than slaves. They
     had large numbers of slaves who assisted in the construction of their empires. Many of the slaves
     were obtained through inter-tribal warfare. The Unyamwezi were considered by many to be the
     most important traders in the interior of Tanzania. They were involved in long distance trade. Due
     to a very strategic position and military might they controlled trade routes. Through trade,
     Mirambo was able to develop a well-equipped private army (the ruga ruga), which he used to
     establish his new kingdom. Mirambo’s courage and generosity earned him the loyalty of his
     people. This enabled him to set up the Urambo state, which he then expanded. The position of the
     state enabled him to control major trade routes in the region. Dues collected from Arab traders
     helped boost the economy of his new state. He then went on to welcome missionaries from the
     London Missionary Society into his state. Therefore, the kingdom was very prosperous under his
     rule. With his death came the collapse of the state he had founded. The sultan of Zanzibar refused
     to continue dealing amicably with the Unyamwezi.

     Mkwawa also used military tactics borrowed from the Ngoni to expand his territory. His warriors
     were well known for harassing caravans that used the busy trade route from Bagamoyo to Tabora.
     While Mirambo collaborated with the missionaries, Mkwawa’s relationship with the Germans was
     poor and this limited the possible developments in his territory. Like Mirambo he also imposed a
     levy (the hongo) on anyone who used the trade routes that passed through his territory. His conflict
     with the Germans led to him closing down the main Tabora–Bagamoyo trade route and eventually
     seeking help from neighbouring communities to fight against the Germans. This turned out to be a
     futile venture. To avoid humiliating defeat at the hands of the Germans, Mkwawa decide to shoot
     himself. Like Mirambo, his empire collapsed after his death.

2.   Discuss the reasons for the rise, and the nature of, the Mahdist state between 1881 and 1895.

     The Mahdist state was established in the Sudan in 1885. The rise of Muhammad Ahmad ibn
     Abdallah as Mahdi, “the guided one”, should be discussed. During this period of time, the Ottoman
     Empire was disintegrating and Islam at the time was seen as ridded by corruption. The aim of the
     Mahdi was therefore to establish a purified Islamic state which was seen by many Muslims as the
     precursor to the end of the world. The internal changes within Egypt which assisted in the rise of
     the Mahdist state (for example, the rise of Urabi Pasha after Khedive Ismail’s overthrow) are also of
     reference, and the appearance of the British who were unwilling to continue spending money on
     controlling the Sudan, should be discussed.

     Under the control of the Egyptians, the people of Sudan had been forced to pay very high taxes,
     and slave trade which was a lucrative trade in the area had also been stopped despite the fact that
     the Egyptian army officers continued in the trade.

     The role of Muhammad ibn Abdallah, who was a good leader in that he was able to unite the people
     of Sudan against the rule of the Egyptians, should also be considered. It could be mentioned that he
     had great support from the Muslim population of Sudan, especially those who supported the
     establishment of an Islamic state and also those who had suffered economically and hoped for
     change which they felt he would bring about.

     Some of his supporters included Ja’aliyin and the Danaqla who supported the slave trade since they
     had greatly benefited from it. Mention can also be made of the Baqqara, who were cattle keepers,
     who hated taxation in any form, and who did not want to be controlled by any form of government.
     The Egyptians’ underestimation of the Mahdi also worked against them. The Egyptian forces that
     were sent to fight against the Mahdi were highly demoralized and this made it difficult for them to
     fight against him. The Sudanese who considered the British “infidels”, all rallied behind the Madhi
     during his fight against them.

     Nature of Mahdist State
     This state was governed by the sharia laws. In this state, service to Jihad was considered very
     important. It was seen more like a military state. To maintain the Islamic nature of the state,
     Christians were persecuted. The state was divided into provinces headed by amirs. Al Jazirah,
     which was a rich area was controlled by the Khalifa.

     Financially the state was organized in the way Medina was organized during the time of Prophet
     Muhamad. All property collected during a raid was shared by all those involved. Conquered land
     was shared among the people who then had to pay both land and poll taxes. In the state all Zakat
     and tithes were paid to the state treasury. Citizens were fined for theft, drunkenness and use of
     tobacco. To support the Jihad, all firearms, godly silver etc were handed to the public treasury.

     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best

3.   Analyse the social, political and economic organization of the Mandinka Empire under
     Samori Toure.

     Social: He strengthened the links with other groups through marriage alliances.
     Political: Samori established his empire between 1867 and 1881. In 1873 he established his capital
     at Bisandugu. For political strength, he absorbed other Mandinka communities either through the
     use of force or through the formation of alliances eg in Futa Jalon. This helped him consolidate
     politically because it reduced any form of resistance. Fortresses were constructed for protection
     purposes. Samori organized the small chiefdoms into a united state controlled by him, and the army
     was an integral part of his state himself. His political system was further supported by a large
     standing army made up of war prisoners. His cavalry and infantry forces were used to protect his
     efficient political system which further won him the support of his people. To gain support from his
     people, he ensured that the military forces were organized on a national and not a local basis. The
     unity of the empire was further enhanced through ensuring that promotions were on merit.
     Economic: Samori traded slaves for horses and firearms. He was able to purchase arms through the
     use of gold from the Boure gold fields. Slaves and ivory were also sent to the north for trade.
     Agriculture was important. They were subsistence farmers who planted peanuts, rice, millet, and
     maize in the sahel region. The state controlled agriculture and also the markets to ensure that there
     was enough food for the people and the army. Women were expected to work in the rice fields.

     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best
     fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


4.   “The rise of strong leaders and kingdoms was the most important effect of the Mfecane.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     There were many effects of the Mfecane and the rise of strong leaders and kingdoms was one of
     them. Leaders like Dingiswayo, Zwide, Mzilikazi, Mosheshwe and Sobhuza may be discussed.
     A clear explanation of how they rose as a result of the Mfecane should be given. The focus of the
     discussion should be on how strong the leaders and their kingdoms were. These leaders emerged so
     as to defend their communities which would have otherwise been totally destroyed by the Mfecane.
     As these leaders tried to protect their people, they began to influence the communities around them.
     Other effects of the Mfecane must be discussed, for example the displacement of various
     communities, many of whom survived on banditry while others were reduced to cannibalism etc.
     As the Ndebele were fleeing, they totally disrupted the lives of every community they came across.
     Law and order was affected by the Mfecane. The social economic and political lives of the people
     in the region were affected by the Mfecane. Land was depopulated through the many deaths that
     occurred, agriculture and trade was interfered with. In the long run, the Mfecane paved the way for
     the Great Trek.

     Candidates should also consider the other effects of the Mfecane to earn high marks.

European imperialism and annexation of Africa 1850–1900

5.   “Economic factors were the major contributors to the partition of Africa.” To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     Economic factors did indeed play a role in the partition of Africa. Key factors such as the need for
     raw materials for industries in Europe, the need for alternative areas for European capitalist
     investment and the search for new markets since home markets were getting saturated need to
     be discussed. The role of traders in West and East Africa can be given as examples.
     Other factors contributing to the partition should also be discussed. Humanitarian/economic
     reasons, like stopping the slave trade, and the introduction of legitimate trade to replace it should be
     discussed. Strategic factors like the British interest in Egypt, etc, should also be considered. The
     role of missionaries, who saw it as their duty to evangelize and educate Africans and to “civilize”
     them, could be addressed. Uganda, Malawi, Nigeria, etc, can be used as examples. The role played
     by explorers in creating awareness of the interior of Africa should also be tackled. The political
     rivalries in Europe which were then extended to Africa, the emergence of new powers like Germany
     and Italy threatened to interfere with the balance of power in Europe might be addressed. Greed
     and prestige should also be considered. Countries such as Italy were looking for ways of
     channeling public opinion back at home from the internal problems, while others, such as Portugal,
     intended to find new areas to settle excess population.

     Candidates should not be expected to cover all of the issues mentioned above. Credit other relevant
     information/issues. The most important aspect of this answer is the extent to which economic and
     other factors have been appropriately addressed.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


6.   Examine the role of the Berlin West Africa Conference in the scramble for Africa.

     The Berlin conference played an important part in the scramble. Reasons why it was convened
     should be discussed. Britain, which was already industrialized, had already begun exploring the
     interior of Africa. As other nations began to industrialize, like Britain, they also set out to acquire
     colonies. To avoid conflict over the occupation of Africa, the Conference established that any
     country occupying a territory had to make the other colonial powers aware and that effective
     occupation had to be carried out. The European nations were also given right to free trade in the
     Congo Free State. How these factors contributed to the scramble should be discussed. It must also
     be made clear there were other factors that contributed to the scramble (the rise of Germany and
     Italy as new states who wanted to join the imperial race, the activities of Leopold II in the Congo,
     economic factors, nationalism and national prestige, European rivalry etc). The link between the
     rise of Germany and the Berlin Conference can also be drawn. It is important that a conclusion is
     drawn as to the importance of the Berlin Conference in the scramble for Africa.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Response to European imperialism (Eastern and Central Africa) 1880–1915

7.   Why did Menelik II organize resistance to the Italians and why did it succeed?

     In April of 1889, Menelik was crowned the Negusa Nagast (King of Kings), after which he signed
     the Treaty of Ucciali with the Italians. The treaty established the boundary between Ethiopia
     and Italy’s territory on the Red Sea. According to article XVII of the Treaty, Italy gained power
     over Ethiopia, which meant that the Italians would direct Ethiopian foreign policy. When Menelik
     decided to enter into an agreement with the French and the Russians in 1890, the Italians felt they
     were right to protest against this action. Menelik’s reaction was that the Italians had misinterpreted
     the agreement which, according to them, meant that the Italians were only expected to act as
     intermediaries and not have full control over them. This led to the setting up of Eritrea as a colony
     in 1890 and, with time, they extended their territory in the region up to 85 000 sq km. In 1893
     Menelik decided to renounce the Treaty of Ucciali leading to the Italians trying to gain the support
     of the chiefs in the North against Menelik. Menelik therefore had to organize resistance against the
     Italians. Using this as an excuse, and in the hope of avenging the defeat of the Italian forces at the
     Battle of Adowa in 1896, the Italian Prime Minister Francesco Crispi sent an Italian expedition to
     the Red Sea.

     Menelik’s success was due to his expansion in the South and East where he was first the King of
     Shewa and then Emperor. Through this he was able to strengthen his country and gain the support
     of the people in all these areas against the Italians. His main aim was to use these territories both to
     keep out the European powers and also to collect revenue from them for the benefit of his kingdom.
     Between 1872 and 1896 his territory had doubled in size. This enabled him to defend his territory
     against the attack by the Italians.

     Another reason for success was the military strength of the Ethiopians. Menelik had a large army
     and he imported weapons. He obtained weapons from the Italians and also received loans from
     them which he used to buy more weapons from Europe. By the time the Italians realised their
     mistake it was too late and Menelik had a strong army which he was able to use against them. The
     weaknesses in the Italian army should also be considered.

     Both the reasons for the resistance and the reasons for Menelik’s success must be discussed to gain
     high marks.

8.   Analyse the causes and the effects of the Maji Maji Rising of 1905 and the reasons for
     its failure.

     The Maji Maji Rising took place in Southern Tanzania aimed at expelling the Germans. There were
     various reasons for the rising and these need to be discussed. The rising began when African farm
     workers refused to go to work but instead ended up killing European traders and missionaries. The
     reasons for their actions included the fact that Africans hated the hut tax and forced labour, both of
     which were new practices introduced by the Germans. They disliked the fact that their traditional
     customs were not being respected and also that their land was being taken away by the Germans.
     They hated the ruthless rule by the Akidas and the Jumbes and this was made worse by the harsh
     rule of the Germans. The issue of compulsory cotton cultivation and low wages also contributed to
     the rising. There was also drought on the eve of the revolt.

     Many Africans died as a result of the Maji Maji Rising when their magic potions failed to protect
     them from the White men’s guns. Under Rechenburg forced labour was suspended, Africans were
     allowed to become Akidas. They were now able to own land, all European newspapers were closed
     down, Swahili became an accepted language for communication and Africans were allowed to grow
     cash crops. Africans realized that for them to be successful in any form of rising they needed to be
     more organized and they also realized the importance of a central authority. By 1907, forced labour
     on European farms was stopped by law. The Germans also realized that to avoid anymore risings,
     changes in their policies towards the Africans had to be made. At least 75 000 people died in the
     course of the revolt. The Labour Commissioner was appointed to ensure that labourers were treated
     well. Communication, education and health for Africans was improved.

9.   Describe the causes and effects of the Anglo–Asante wars between 1873 and 1900.

     These wars took place between 1873 and 1900 between the British and the Asante. By 1844, the
     British, under an agreement, took control of the Fante who were a vassal state of the Asante
     Confederation, thus infringing on the Asante sovereignty. This event caused a lot of tension
     between the British and the Asante. This tension was a long-term cause of the Anglo–Asante wars.

     One reason for the conflict was the failure of the British to respect the culture of the Asante people.
     All the gold in Asante belonged to the Asantehene according to Asante law and so anyone coming
     across gold had to hand it over to the Asantehene. When some Asante people discovered gold and
     refused to hand it over to the Asantehene, but instead ran away to the British Cape Coast Colony,
     the British refusal to hand over these people to the Asantehene Kwaku Dua I was seen as
     demeaning the Asantehene’s authority. This was a direct sign of disloyalty towards the Asantehene.
     To assert his authority, Asantehene Kwaku Dua I decided to send his army to the Gold Coast.

     The British refusal to hand back Elmina and the destruction of Kumasi also contributed to the
     tension that led to the Anglo–Asante wars.

     The effects of this invasion included the fact that the British were badly defeated and many people
     lost their lives. This was a very costly war for the British who decided to form a parliamentary
     select committee, whose aim was to find ways of looking into British policies in West Africa.

     Recommendations made by the committee included the fact that there should be no more expansion
     of British authority in the area, and that there should be no more treaties signed with African leaders
     to protect them. Since the British were intending to withdraw from the area, Africans were to be
     supported to prepare for self rule. In reality they never really withdrew but stayed on for some time
     after this war.

10.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Khama collaborate with the British between
      1875 and 1895?

      Khama was the chief of the Bamangwato, a Tswana group, from 1875. As a result of the scramble
      for Africa, the British found themselves in Khama’s territory. Cecil Rhodes and the British South
      Africa Company were also interested in the resources in the area. The activities of the missionaries
      can also be discussed. In 1885, at a meeting with the British, Khama hoped to get protection from
      the British whom he believed would support Tswana laws on the prohibition on the sale of alcohol
      and land. But when he realized that the British needed land for themselves, he decided to give them
      land so as to maintain good relations with them. His reason for supporting the British was to ensure
      that his territory would be protected from the Boers. Meanwhile he ensured that he offered the
      British land that was not of any benefit to him. In order to develop his kingdom further, he decided
      to request the British to introduce education in his territory. Khama’s men also accompanied the
      British South Africa Company forces on what was known as the Southern column, where they
      contributed about 300 men armed with rifles. He therefore played an important role in the British
      occupation of the interior. This went on until there was an outbreak of smallpox among his men.
      Khama withdrew his support at this point. This had a major impact in that it weakened the column,
      but eventually two other columns managed to reach Bulawayo and Lobengula was forced to flee to
      the north. As an outcome of his collaboration with the British, Lewanika also sought protection
      from the British which eventually led to the signing of the Lochner treaty in June 1890. With
      Khama and Coillard’s influence Lewanika was able to turn against practices like witchcraft and
      slavery. This also opened him up to more contacts with the West which eventually led to his visit to
      England in 1902. The results include the fact that he was able to maintain good relations with the
      British which ensured him of protection against the Boer. Education was introduced into his
      kingdom. Neighbouring communities also collaborated with the British seeing the benefits he had
      gained.

Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

11.   Explain the factors that led to the creation of the Bantustans and the impact they had on the
      lives of black South Africans between 1940 and 1980.

      As a result of the discrimination which took place against black South Africans, there were a series
      of disturbances which took place between 1959 and 1960. The height of this was the Sharpeville
      massacre of 1960 when police opened fire on demonstrators. With the belief that moderate African
      opposition had failed, extremist groups were founded and they believed in militant action against
      European domination. With more of the black leaders like Mandela being imprisoned, black South
      Africans adopted violent methods of resistance. With an increase in international outcry about the
      horrors of apartheid, Verwoed decided to set up black homelands where the various language
      groups could be re-settled. The main reason for the setting up of the Bantustans was to separate
      white South Africans from black South Africans in every way possible. With the creation of
      Bantustans Europeans were assured of their supremacy and they were sure that by dividing black
      South Africans it would be difficult for them to unite against the Europeans. By giving black South
      Africans autonomy in the Bantustans, they hoped the outside world would see the positive side of
      the apartheid regime and therefore support it. One of the main beliefs of the supporters of apartheid
      was that South Africa was to be divided along the lines of separate White and Black territory.
      According to the system, blacks were to be labourers. The Bantustans covered about 13 % of the
      country. These were formed as a result of the Homelands Act of 1951.

      Effects of the creation of the Bantustans included the increased resistance from black South
      Africans; some of the blacks working in the white areas had to travel long distances to get to their
      places of work leading to even more discontent. Some of the land that was given to the blacks was
      marginal and agricultural output was greatly reduced. The Bantustans were very small and
      congested lacking in essential social facilities. Poverty levels increased. The industrial
      development which was to take place in the Bantustans was a total failure and the general living
      conditions were below what had been expected by black South Africans. All these issues led to
      increased discontent among the black South Africans both within and outside the Bantustans.

12.   How effective was the resistance to apartheid in South Africa between 1948 and 1980?

      Candidates need to note that the resistance came from different parts of the population not just from
      black South Africans. The resistance to apartheid led to the development of more African political
      parties all aimed at the overthrow of European supremacy. The formation of parties like the
      African National Congress (ANC) should be considered. The Sharpeville massacre, the
      imprisonment of many black activists, forced exile, and even death, of some of the leaders who
      resisted apartheid should be discussed. Increase in migrant workers and the general disruption of
      the economic activities eg reduction in foreign investments can be discussed. Events like the
      Soweto massacre and the development of the independent churches can also be discussed. The
      response from the international world, eg boycotts due to the ruthless handling of those who resisted
      apartheid, can also be considered. There was the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe which was
      responsible for carrying out acts of sabotage. These eventually led to the passing of the General
      Law Amendments (Sabotage) Act of 1962 which introduced house arrest and also forbade the
      publications of anyone who was considered “banned”. The resistance to apartheid had a huge
      contribution to South Africa attaining Black rule under Nelson Mandela. All in all the resistance
      led to the relaxing of many of the apartheid laws which had created a lot of tension in South Africa.

Africa under colonialism 1890–1980

13.   Describe the successes and failures of British rule in Kenya in the years 1895–1963.

      The country was divided into provinces and districts for easy administration. Due to lack of
      centralized systems of government in many parts of the country, it was very difficult for the British to
      work closely with the various communities while establishing their political systems in Kenya. Many
      of the communities were governed by clan elders. With the establishment of colonial rule, there were
      a number of social, political and economic successes, but there were also some failures. The British
      were successful in the establishment of an efficient administrative system which covered the whole
      country. The transport system in Kenya was improved through the construction of the Kenya Uganda
      railway line from Mombasa to the interior of Uganda. Communication and trade was improved
      between the two countries. Road networks were also developed and this supported agricultural
      development especially in growing and marketing of cash crops like coffee and cotton. The Kenya
      highlands were opened up to more and more agricultural development. The numbers of European
      settlers in the interior of Kenya increased since land was made very cheap for them. This occupation
      led to a lot of resentment among the African inhabitants who resisted their traditional lands being
      occupied by foreigners. Forced labour, the kipande system and taxes were introduced leading to
      discontent among Africans. To the Europeans these may have been considered successes, but not to
      Africans. The railway construction was done by Indians, many of whom settled in various parts of
      the interior, where they set up businesses. Other developments included the construction of schools
      and hospitals, many of which were run by missionaries. With time small scale processing industries
      were established to produce consumer goods. Employment was created in various sectors. Many
      towns developed along the railway line and these became centres of business. In some areas British
      rule is seen as having intensified conflict between various communities. The formal education
      system, according to traditionalists, would be seen as having interfered with the African culture,
      African political systems etc. To this group of people the emphasis would be on the British rule
      having been negative and therefore a failure.

14.   Evaluate the success of the colonial administration in the Gold Coast in the years 1890–1957.

      The Gold Coast was considered important mainly because of its economic benefits, especially from
      cocoa and gold. The wages of workers in the mines were controlled by Europeans. Wages were
      kept very low with the aim of making more profit and keeping the miners working. As in other
      areas, the British used the indirect system of rule. In some areas, especially in the north, it was
      much more difficult to find rulers for the indirect system to be applied successfully. Under the
      governorship of Gordon Guggisberg, there was more African representation in the legislative
      council. There was also more economic development through the improvement of the transport
      system. Education was enhanced through the establishment of Achimota College in 1927. To this
      extent one can argue that the colonial administration was a success in that it played a part in the
      social, economic and political development of the Gold Coast.

      However, by 1948 resistance to colonial administration began in earnest. There was discontent,
      especially among ex-servicemen, who did not support economic control by foreigners. The
      situation worsened with the colonial administration insisting that cocoa plants infected by swollen
      shoots should be cut down. All this can be used to question how successful the colonial
      administration was. The weakness of the colonial administration is what eventually paved the way
      for the call for self-government and, under Kwame Nkrumah, the attainment of independence.

Social and economic developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries 1800–1960

15.   Analyse the impact of Islam in any two of the following regions between 1800 and 1960:
      Eastern and Central Africa; West Africa; North Africa.

      It is important to note that Islam as a religion impacts the social, political and economic lives of its
      adherents. With the spread of Islam, traditional cultures which were not compatible with Islam
      were eliminated. In Buganda, Islam became popular after Kabaka Mutesa converted in 1866. With
      Islam came the spread of the Arabic language, the construction of mosques and the introduction of
      Arab dress and culture in the interior of Africa. In Buganda those who opposed the spread of Islam
      were punished and some were executed. These effects apply both to Eastern and Central Africa.
      Trade also increased.

      Islam intensified in West Africa during the colonial period more than it had before this period. In
      West Africa Islam resulted in both unity and division. The divisions mainly occurred between the
      different Islamic brotherhoods which rivalled each other. There was also the emergence of many
      Islamic states in the savanna lands. The spread of Islam was marked by the jihads whose aim was
      to purify Islam. The effects of the jihads should be discussed. Islamic universities were constructed
      which helped in the spread of Islamic education. During the time of Al Hajj Umar any conquered
      community which did not accept Islam had their farms and homes burnt down. In the Sokoto
      Caliphate, Sharia law was applied. Tension between Muslims and non-Muslims intensified in some
      regions of West Africa. Arabic architecture was also embraced in some regions of West Africa.
      North Africa was also affected in the same way, although this was over a longer period of time.
      Towns developed, mosques were built and architecture was also influenced. Islamic culture was
      embraced by more and more people

16.   Examine the major changes in the role of women in either South or West Africa in the
      twentieth century up to 1960.

      The change in the role of women in the two areas may have been as a result of the spread of
      Christianity or Islam, the introduction of Western education and Western culture, introduction of
      new laws which have given women more rights, and also the introduction of new technology. With
      the introduction of Western education, women were able to gain skills for various careers which
      previously had been the reserve of men. This enabled women to start participating in the political
      life of the society. This was further enhanced by the introduction of laws which gave women the
      right to vote. Women, who had been confined to the home, were now able to seek employment
      outside the home and become more economically independent. The role played by women in
      religious activities also slowly increased. With Christianity women were able to participate more in
      community activities and they were no longer forced to stay in polygamous marriages which were a
      main feature of traditional societies. Women were able to participate in political roles in society
      although this change was often slow depending on the region. With new technology, women were
      now able to use machines to do most of the jobs that they had previously done manually and this
      gave them more time to participate in other activities. The extent of the degree of change in the role
      of the women varied between rural and urban areas. South Africa would be a good example of
      where the role of women was more affected by Christianity, while in West Africa the impact is both
      through the spread of Christianity or Islam, depending on the region being looked at.

Nationalist and independence movements (Eastern and Central Africa)

17.   For what reasons, and with what effects, did the Central African Federation collapse?

      After the failed attempts to amalgamate Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia
      (Zimbabwe), in 1949 a conference was held at Victoria Falls where it was agreed that a Federation
      be formed instead. This meeting was only attended by the Europeans. African leaders and the
      British colonial secretary who did not attend the meeting were in total opposition to the formation
      of the Federation. The British later agreed to the formation of the Federation in 1951. One problem
      of the Federation was that African interests were never to be considered greater than those of
      Europeans. This inequality factor was a major cause of problems in the Federation. The Africans
      were more interested in self-government and not in the formation of a Federation, which
      emphasized a partnership which to them would only foster inequality. One reason for the failure of
      the Federation is that it did not fully get the support of all the parties concerned. The Africans were
      suspicious about its aims from the beginning. The activities of various nationalistic groups also
      made it impossible for the Federation to work, eg the activities of Simon ber Zukas in Zambia. The
      formation of the Anti Federation Action Committee should also be discussed. The chiefs, including
      those of the Bemba and the Ngoni in Zambia, did not support the Federation which meant their
      people would also not support it. The constitution of the Federation was also not accepted by both
      the African members of the legislation in Zambia and the two whites who were in charge of African
      affairs. Despite all this the Federation came into existence in October 1953. The fact that
      Zimbabwe seemed to be the dominating power in the Federation did not go down well with Zambia.
      Zambia felt that it was not getting the rightful revenue it ought to have been receiving from the
      Federation. Many of the Africans did not benefit from the Federation and felt betrayed since they
      were the ones who had to pay indirect taxation. They therefore did not support the Federation. For
      most of the Europeans, the formation of this Federation was to lead to the settlers having more
      control of Zambia and Zimbabwe. The formation of the Federation failed, but it can be noted that it
      led to the growth of African nationalism. The Federation led to more investment and immigration
      of Europeans to Zambia. With the Federation there was improvement in the lives of European mine
      workers. There was more development in Zimbabwe whose capital, Salisbury (Harare), became the
      Federal capital. For the Africans, the social and economic gains from the Federation were limited.
      In some areas there was an increase in the growth of cash crops. Some Africans also got jobs in
      lower level industries. The slow pace of education for Africans and their involvement in politics
      should also be discussed. In general the Federation did not get the full support it required for it to
      continue surviving. In Malawi, the Federation was opposed because it would hinder political
      advancement. Leaders like Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda were not willing to settle for anything less
      than independence. The failure of the federation meant that each of the countries involved
      remained as independent states.

18.   “Without the Mau Mau, Kenya would not have attained independence.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      To some historians, Mau Mau was seen as a tribal movement among the Gikuyu which was ready to
      work with members from other communities. This so-called tribal movement’s aim was to serve
      the Kenyan Nation in general and not just a specific tribe. This is a group that is believed to have
      emerged in 1952 during the time of the state of emergency. With the arrest of the leaders of the
      Kenya African Union (KAU), many men went into the forest to begin guerrilla warfare against the
      colonialists. The fight against the Mau Mau went on for about four years and was very expensive
      for the British. Among the outcomes of the Mau Mau rebellion was the British realization that
      Africans needed to be given their rights and this eventually culminated in the attainment of
      independence. But it is important to note that there were other factors that also contributed to the
      attainment of independence, eg the role played by political parties which put pressure on the
      government to give Africans more rights, the trade unions, many of which began as economic
      rallying points, but with time turned political, African leaders who, even before the Mau Mau, had
      begun to make the British government aware of the needs of the Africans etc. Candidates should be
      able to identify all the factors that contributed to Kenya attaining independence and then show to
      what extent they think the Mau Mau was the most important factor.

Nationalist and independence movements (Southern and West Africa)

19.   Why did Nigeria achieve independence later than Ghana?

      Nigeria’s independence was delayed for a number of reasons and ethnic differences played a part in
      this delay. There were three main political parties based on ethnic groupings. One group supported
      by the Ibos was interested in the establishment of a united centralized Nigeria. This group
      dominated the South Eastern section of Nigeria. The Western region was dominated by the Yoruba.
      Under Governor Sir Arthur Richards a new constitution allowed for the creation of Houses of
      Assembly in the Northern, Eastern and Western regions. Richard’s constitution was replaced by
      Macpherson’s constitution, which allowed for the formation of the federal system. Some of the
      parties wanted Nigeria to have a loose federation. The slogan of the Northern Peoples’ Congress
      for example was “One North, One People”. All this disagreement and mistrust among the political
      parties contributed to the delay in Nigeria’s independence. There was also the role played by
      religious differences in the north which was Islamic and the other regions in the west and east that
      were more progressive. For independence to be attained, the British insisted that all the three
      regions had to have gained their self government and this further delayed independence.

      On the other hand, Ghana had strengths that made it gain independence three years before Nigeria.
      Ghana also had both ethnic and religious differences but not to the same extent as Nigeria.
      In Ghana there was already a long history of political unrest and also a huge number of educated
      lawyers and businessmen, all of whom played an important role in politics. By 1945 the Ghanaians
      already had reasons to protest against economic exploitation by the Europeans. The impact of the
      Second World War, for example the frustrations of ex-servicemen whose gratuities became
      worthless due to high prices, and the granting of import licenses only to European and Syrian
      businessmen all contributed to heightened nationalism in Ghana. The Burns constitution of 1946
      led to the creation of a legislative council with an African majority. The formation of the United
      Gold Coast Convention by JB Danquah in 1947 provided a channel through which the calls for
      early self-government were made. Ghana had a strong leader in the person of Kwame Nkrumah
      who was also the leader of the leading political party. The goal of his Convention People’s Party
      was “Self Government Now”. This political party had followers from all classes in society.
      This new political party became the major threat to the British government. The Watson
      Commission, led by Sir Henley Coussey, made recommendations aimed at constitutional changes
      for the benefits of Ghanaians. Under Governor Sir Charles Arden-Clark, Nkrumah was requested to
      form the first African government. The internal self-government developed between 1951–1957.
      All of the above contributed to Ghana’s fast achievement of independence.

20.   Analyse the role played by UNITA and MPLA in Angola’s attainment of independence.

      Angola attained independence in 1975. Both the Union for the National Independence of the
      Totality of Angola (UNITA) and the Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola (MPLA)
      played an important role in the attainment of independence. MPLA was led by a pro-Marxist
      Agostinho Neto. UNITA was founded by Jonas Savimbi, and played a part in the start of the
      liberation war in Angola which begun in 1961 led by MPLA, who tried to release their leaders who
      had been imprisoned in Luanda. The MPLA were influenced by activities in Belgian Congo. The
      resistance by MPLA was dealt with ruthlessly leading to many deaths. The Portuguese were not
      ready at this stage to give in to the demands for freedom. The second phase of resistance was
      delayed by the development that was taking place in Angola with the exploitation of its natural
      resources by the Europeans. In the second phase, there was a change of demands by the two parties
      whose main aim was more on who would control the country’s newly developed resources. This
      conflict therefore hindered unity which, in turn, delayed the attainment of independence. The
      Portuguese had to keep a huge military force in Angola which put a lot of strain on the
      government’s finances. This eventually contributed to them giving in to Angola’s independence in
      November 1975. The two parties therefore played an important part in the attainment of Angola’s
      independence.

Post-independence politics to 2000

21.   Using any two countries studied, discuss the reasons that contributed to the establishment of
      single-party states.

      Examples of single-party states must be correctly identified. The importance of a strong leader can
      be considered. All single-party states have to deal with the issue of opposition for them to be able
      to establish themselves in power. The opposition is therefore either banned or made to convert to
      the party in control. They take full control of the military, financial services, communication, etc,
      which they use for their benefit. Some use propaganda and also ensure that they address the needs
      of the people in their agendas. Single-party states will use rewards and punishments to deal with
      any form of opposition that existed. They used the allocation of resources to establish their power.
      In some countries, there were political mergers/coalitions that were eventually used to eliminate the
      opposition. They also came up with policies which appealed to a large part of the population.
      Proper use of communication was used by the political parties to either create awareness of their
      policies or for propaganda. There was the relative weakness of the civil society in the immediate
      post-independence period (there were weak trade unions, high unemployment, and the mass media
      was easily controlled etc). To establish themselves in power, single-party states used a combination
      of repressive and persuasive measures which candidates need to discuss.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

22.   Using any two post-colonial states, discuss the social and economic challenges to development
      that they faced up to 2000.

      The countries can be from any part of Africa. The degree of challenges differed from one country to
      another. In the pre-colonial period there was over-reliance on subsistence farming especially in the
      rural areas. During the colonial era there was the emphasis on the production of cash crops. During
      the post-colonial period many of the countries in Africa focused on the selling of agricultural produce
      and raw materials cheaply in European markets, where prices were controlled by the developed
      countries. This had an adverse effect on the production of subsistence crops and also on the economy
      of these countries in general. Many post-colonial African countries had their development hampered
      by poor means of transport and communication. Many of the roads were impassable during rainy
      seasons thus interfering with trading activities. Many rural areas which had been neglected during the
      colonial period had to be developed since most of the earlier developments had taken place in the
      urban areas. A lot of money was needed to sort out these problems yet money was not readily
      available. Even in the urban areas governments had to deal with issues of lack of adequate social
      facilities as more people moved into towns to seek employment. Other problems that can be
      considered would include high illiteracy levels, ethnic conflicts etc. There was also the need to
      increase food production with the increase in population. Urban centres grew as people moved from
      rural areas to seek employment. Political instability and corruption also added to the challenges.
      Many governments did not have money for development and therefore relied on loans which
      eventually put them into debt thus increasing their economic challenges.

Africa, international organizations and the international community

23.   “The Abyssinian Crisis was a death blow to the League of Nations.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      Abyssinia was important in bringing the League of Nations to its end because with the League’s
      failure to handle the Abyssinian crisis, the League was never taken seriously again. In 1935
      Abyssinia was attacked by Italy under Mussolini. Many reasons have been given for this attack.
      Some see it as a revenge for Italy’s defeat in 1896 at the battle of Adowa. Other historians suggest
      that Italy was undergoing a lot of economic problems due to the depression and the attack on
      Abyssinia was seen as a way of distracting the people from these internal problems. Much of
      Africa had already been colonized and Abyssinia was a rare region that was still free. It is also
      believed that Mussolini hoped for economic benefits in Abyssinia (eg oil) and also wanted to settle
      some of the Italian population there. It may have been to complete the Italian occupation of the
      Horn of Africa, since they were already in control of Eritrea.

      When Italy invaded Abyssinia in October 1935, Italy was seen as the aggressor by the League of
      Nations. As a result, the League imposed economic sanctions on Italy, but this did not include oil
      and steel. The United Kingdom, which was a permanent member of the League of Nations, also
      failed to block the Suez Canal to prevent Italian ships using it. The United Kingdom and France,
      who had signed the Stresa Front, did not want to offend Italy in any way. This led to them signing
      the Hoare Laval Treaty which gave Italy two thirds of Abyssinia. By May 1936, Italy had taken
      control over the whole of Abyssinia.

      The League failed to protect Abyssinia even after Haile Selassie’s plea to the League. The
      weakness of the League of Nations was made very clear here because economic sanctions had
      failed and collective security was not applied. It was clear that the League was not able to defend
      the smaller states when they were attacked by bigger powers and this led to a lack of confidence in
      the League of Nations which eventually led to its collapse.

      Candidates should also consider other events that contributed to the League declining for example
      the impact of the Great Depression and the emergence of aggressive leaders in the 1930s, the failure
      of the Disarmament Conference and the failure of the League over the Manchurian crisis and the
      Spanish Civil War.

24.   For what reasons, and with what effects, did any two African countries get involved in the
      Cold War?

      Examples that can be used would include Egypt under Nasser, Congo under Lumumba, Angola,
      Namibia, and Ethiopia under Mengistu, etc. In Egypt the events leading to the Suez Crisis and its
      effects can be considered. The Soviet Union supported Patrice Lumumba while the Americans
      supported the UN peacekeeping forces to the Congo. In all these cases, the need to spread
      Communism and the fear of Communism brought in both USSR and US into these countries. Some
      of the effects of the Cold War included heightened tension which, in some cases prolonged conflicts
      which led to death and devastation like in the Congo Crisis. In other cases it delayed independence
      as in the example of Namibia. In cases like the Congo Crisis, the United Nations had to get
      involved to sort out the Crisis and its effects on the country.

      In Angola, the USSR supplied weapons to Cuba who, in turn, supplied weapons to the MPLA. On
      the other hand the US backed South Africa, which supported UNITA. All this heightened tension
      in Angola and contributed to the delayed independence.

      The economic and political situations in the chosen countries which contributed to their
      involvement in the Cold War should be considered.
