These sources and questions relate to Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution of 1989.

SOURCE A                Extract from The Fall of Communism in Czechoslovakia by Ján Čarnogurský, 2006.
                        Ján Čarnogurský was prime minister of the Slovak Republic.

Naturally, only a minority in a society puts up resistance against an authoritarian regime. However,
this minority can motivate more and more people to take part in the individual events that are part of the
process of undermining a dictatorship. In Czechoslovakia during the 1980s the number of people willing
to sign a petition, make a proclamation or protest against a trial was increasing, as was the number of
people willing to join a demonstration. The responsibility of the active minority lies in not driving people
into protests against the regime that would put them at too great a risk. If resistance leaders assess the
social situation in their country incorrectly, and take protests further than the level supported by at least a
significantly large group of people, they usually end in failure and such a failure tends to strengthen the
existing dictatorship.

Between 1988 and 1989 a group of lawyers in Czechoslovakia drafted a Czechoslovak constitution to
be applied after the fall of Communism. It was a constitution that met all the standard requirements of
democratic states. However, the future constitution project did not reflect the real political pressures that
arose shortly after the collapse of Communism in Czechoslovakia.


SOURCE B                Extract from “New Year’s address to the nation” by Vaclav Havel, published on
                        the Czech Republican Presidential website, 1 January 1990. Vaclav Havel was
                        president of Czechoslovakia in 1990.

Three days ago I became the president of the Republic as a consequence of your will, expressed through the
Federal Assembly. You have a right to expect me to mention the tasks I see before me.

First is to use all my power to ensure that we step up to the ballot boxes in a free election, and that our path
toward this historic event is dignified and peaceful.

My second task is to guarantee that we approach these elections as two self-governing nations who respect
each other’s interests, national identity, religious traditions and symbols and to see that the interests of the
Slovak nation are respected and that no office, including the highest, is closed to it in future.

My third task is to support everything that will lead to better circumstances for our children, the elderly,
women, the sick, the hardworking labourers, the national minorities and all citizens who are, for any reason,
worse off than others.

SOURCE C               Extract from 1989 as a Return to Europe: On Revolution, Reform,
                       and Reconciliation with a Traumatic Past by Dragoş Petrescu, 2008.
                       Dragoş Petrescu is a faculty member of the Department of Political Science,
                       University of Bucharest.

Two major elements have to be taken into consideration when providing an in-depth analysis of
the 1989 revolutions: (1) violence should not be considered a necessary element of revolution;
and (2) mass protest should be regarded as an important precondition of a revolution.

A combination of circumstances played a role in the unfolding of events in 1989. International media and
Radio Free Europe contributed heavily to the collapse of Communist regimes in East–Central Europe.
Nevertheless there were external factors that had a strong influence on the collapse of Communism
in Europe. Some authors mention the 1978 election of a Polish Pope, others emphasize the role of
American President Ronald Reagan and his determination to establish a weapons system that weakened
the Soviet Union economically and militarily, as factors leading to the breakdown of Communist regimes
in East-Central Europe. All these assertions are true, and have to be seriously considered. However,
two external factors were of major importance in the collapse of Communism in East–Central Europe:
(1) the Gorbachev factor; and (2) the “snowball effect”.

A detailed analysis of what ordinary people in East-Central Europe wanted when they poured into the
streets and asked for a regime change would go beyond the scope of this paper, yet many people simply
wanted to live better and it was clear that the communist regimes were not able to provide for their
populations in this respect.


SOURCE D               Extract from Candle Demonstration – March 25 1988, written on the occasion of
                       the twentieth anniversary of the demonstration, by The Ladislav Hanus Fellowship.
                       Founded in 2002, the Fellowship is a non-governmental educational organization
                       seeking to form strong Christian leaders.

Around 2000 people attended the half-hour demonstration in Hviezdoslav Square, Bratislava;
thousands were in adjacent streets. No speeches were made during the demonstration – the people
expressed resistance with burning candles and prayers. The state police reacted with violence – they used
clubs and water cannons against the demonstrators. Tens of people, including those who were there
by chance, were arrested and cross-examined for hours.

The main organizers were detained the entire day to prevent them from joining the meeting.

The aggression against the quiet prayer demonstration met with critical reactions in the democratic world.
News of the Bratislava event was broadcast by the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation], Voice of
America, Radio Free Europe and Vatican Radio.
