1.   (a)   (i)    Define the term recession indicated in bold in the text (paragraph 2).       [2 marks]

                  Level                                                                           Marks

                      The idea that there is a fall in output or a deep slowdown.

                    2 There is clear understanding.                                                 2
                      An explanation that it occurs when an economy experiences two
                      consecutive quarters of falling output (negative growth).

           (ii)   Define the term current account indicated in bold in the text
                  (paragraph ).                                                [2 marks]

                      The idea that it involves measuring exports and imports.

                    2 Accurate definition.                                                          2
                      An explanation that it is a measure of the flow of funds from trade in
                      goods and services (value of exports minus imports), plus net income
                      flows (profits, interest, wages, rents) and net transfers of money
                      (foreign aid, grants, pensions, etc).

(b)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain the reason for the improvement in
      Bolivia’s terms of trade (paragraph ).                                 [4 marks]

      Level                                                                                Marks

        1 There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                       1–2
          For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram showing an
          increase in demand for commodities and an increase in the price of
          commodities or an explanation that increasing demand for exported
          commodities leads to a rise in export prices (relative to import prices) and
          therefore an improvement in the terms of trade.

        2 There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.                      3–4
          For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram showing an
          increase in demand for commodities and an increase in the price of
          commodities and an explanation that increasing demand for exported
          commodities leads to a rise in export prices (relative to import prices) and
          therefore an improvement in the terms of trade.

      Students may take another approach to explain an increase in the price of exports.
      If correctly labelled and explained, this may be rewarded fully.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

(c)   Explain what is likely to have happened to any of the components of Bolivia’s
      financial account as a result of its current account surplus from 2004-2010
      (assuming no change in the capital account).                                  [4 marks]

      Level                                                                                Marks

          An awareness that the surplus on the current account between 2004 and
          2010 means that there is a deficit on the financial (plus capital) account.

        2 The written response is accurate.                                                 3–4
          An explanation that the deficit on the financial account may have come
          about as a result of any one of the following:
           an increase in foreign reserves (paragraph )
           lending abroad
           purchasing foreign assets.

           Alternatively, candidates may argue that excess funds generated by the
           current account are used to purchase overseas financial assets that appear on
           the financial account.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the change in Bolivia’s exchange rate policy in moving from a fixed
      exchange rate to a managed float in late 2010 (paragraph ).                 [8 marks]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      Arguments in favour of a fixed Bolivian Boliviano: (the opposite of these
      arguments could also used to explain the disadvantages of a managed float)
       high degree of certainty for stakeholders, allowing planning of investment and
         consumption spending; since 80% of imports are used by the manufacturing
         sector, a fixed exchange rate gives more certainty to manufacturers –
         (paragraph )
       reduced uncertainty associated with currency fluctuations encourages trade
       avoidance of exchange rate fluctuations with trading partners that are also fixed
         to the dollar
       the Bolivian central bank has large amounts of international reserves with
         which to support the Boliviano (paragraph )
       as long as there are current account surpluses, there is no fear of running out of
         international reserves
       reduced risk of inflation from a depreciation of the Boliviano.

Arguments in favour of a managed float: (the opposite of these arguments could
also used to explain the disadvantages of a fixed exchange rate)
 easier to adjust to external shocks
 ease of adjustment may be especially important to a country like Bolivia,
   which is highly dependent on a few commodity exports subject to high price
   volatility
 greater flexibility offered to policy makers to carry out independent monetary
   and fiscal policy, as interest rates and government spending do not have to
   respond to the needs of maintaining the fixed exchange rate
 an appreciation of the Boliviano is needed to reverse inflation, which was over
   10 % in mid-2011
 reduced inflationary pressures will reduce costs of imported inputs for
   manufacturers (paragraph )
 as the Boliviano appreciates, the current account surplus is likely to be reduced,
   due to lower imports and greater exports, helping to achieve a reasonable
   balance in the current account
 reference to the M-L condition (or inverse M-L condition)
 the achievement of a reasonable balance in the current account over the longer
   term will help avoid problems resulting from persistent current account
   surpluses (lower consumption and investment spending, reduced export
   competitiveness).

Any reasonable evaluation.

To reach Level 3, students must do more than deliver a standard discussion of the
advantages and disadvantages of a fixed exchange rate versus a managed float
exchange system. There must be an awareness of the Bolivian context. This
might be related to the persistent current account surpluses, or the inflationary
pressure that might have been the result of an undervalued boliviano.

      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that

      Responses may include:
       an explanation of how Japan might intervene in the yen market to bring about a
        depreciation. (paragraph )

      Arguments in favour of intervention:
       Net exports may rise as exports become more competitive and imports become
        more expensive
       Reference to the ML condition; the effect on net exports depends on the price
        elasticity of demand for exports and imports;
       an increase in net exports results in an increase in AD, which may help to bring
        Japan out of recession (paragraph ), raise business confidence (paragraph )
        and help to bring about some inflation, which would be positive in Japan’s
        deflationary environment (paragraph )
       increased revenue for exporters (paragraph )
       may offset the effect of the trade protection in export markets (paragraph )

       Japan has little alternative, at least in the short run, to stimulate economic
        growth considering its economic situation

Arguments against intervention
 possibility of a currency war (paragraph )
 prevents the economy from re-structuring away from a dependence on exports
  (paragraph )
 Japan may be accused of currency manipulation
 may spark increased protection in export markets
 can only do this by accumulating reserves, since interest rates have fallen to
  zero (paragraph ).

          to any reason, including any of the following:
           uncertainty about export revenues makes it difficult for an ELDC
             government to plan its spending on development objectives
           falling prices mean that governments have less revenues to finance
             investment in development objectives
           trade barriers in EMDCs prevent producers from accessing markets and
             raising incomes.
           If comparative advantage is lost, this might result in structural
             unemployment and a fall in living standards.

 interventionist supply-side policies (investment in health and education,
  industrial policies) can result in growth with development, improvements in
  quality of life, improved income distribution (paragraph )
 market-oriented supply-side policies may result in growth with increasing
  poverty and worsening income distribution - inequality increase by 14 %
  (paragraph )
 importance of improved income distribution for growth with development
  (paragraph )
 for growth with development need growth policies that address the causes of
  poverty (increased employment opportunities, investments in human capital,
  etc)
 even growth of 10 % per year (paragraph ) is unlikely to reduce poverty and
  improve standards of living if growth policies are not inclusive/aimed at
  poverty alleviation (investments in human capital, micro-credit for the poor,
  income redistribution policies, increased property rights, increased
  wages/improved labour conditions, improved human rights)
 growth may result in negative externalities which may lead to a lower quality
  of life.

Any reasonable examination.
