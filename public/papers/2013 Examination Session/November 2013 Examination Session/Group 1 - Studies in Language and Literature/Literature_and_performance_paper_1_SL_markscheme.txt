                                 ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
Assessment Criterion A                                                           Maximum [5 marks]

The task is essentially focused on an analysis of a chosen passage from a prose text. Through this
analysis the level of understanding will be evaluated by the examiner. This “understanding” of the
text should include the relevance of the passage and its place in the context of the novel as a whole.
A synopsis of the plot of the text may be a first step towards demonstrating understanding but
“good” and “perceptive” understanding will evaluate style and theme as well as plot detail. The
analysis and understanding of these elements of the text will be always conducted with a view to the
performance of the chosen passage. The importance of support and validation of all ideas through
reference to the text is crucial. The text is fundamental and reference to it mandatory.


Assessment Criterion B                                                         Maximum [10 marks]

The “ideas” for performance are generated from the text and should not be independent of it.
The textual “justification” required to support the “ideas for performance” in Criterion B will be
drawn from a thorough contextualization of the passage and a secure understanding of its relevance
to whatever issues the questions raise.

The association of “good” and “excellent” with the word “practical” attests to the value of ideas that
can be realized in a practical staging context. These are ideas for the stage or a staging area and
temptations to propose grandiose scenarios more applicable to “blockbuster” cinema than theatre
should be resisted.

The candidate may draw diagrams or make sketches if it is thought that these are necessary to
communicate the “ideas for performance” but such visual additions are not mandatory.
                                                –4–            N13/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Assessment Criterion C                                                          Maximum [5 marks]

This criterion evaluates the clarity and coherence of the language used in the essay and looks at the
appropriateness of the register, style and terminology which the candidate employs.

Clearly in an exercise which demands a facility in two disciplines, namely literature and
performance, the candidate will be expected to demonstrate a facility in the use of the terminology
specific to each discipline. As a writer of prose the candidate will be assessed on clarity, variety,
precision and concision. The clarity of a written communication depends on accuracy in grammar,
spelling and sentence construction. The effectiveness of a written communication will depend on
the use of vocabulary, a sense for precision or accuracy of expression and concision which argues
for an economy of expression. The persuasiveness of a piece of writing will depend on choice of
idiom and style.


These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.
                                                 –5–             N13/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The following elements are particularly relevant to Criteria A, B and C:

Question 1

Criteria A

An average candidate will choose a passage from the novel which is connected to the question.
The student is likely to justify this choice with a general attempt to put the passage into context with
the rest of the novel. The candidate will be capable of selecting some relevant quotation from the
text that will go some way to justifying the choice though justifications and rationale for choice are
likely to be expressed in general rather than specific terms.

The good candidate will choose a passage that is clearly relevant to the question and will justify this
choice by placing the selected passage into an active relationship to the rest of the novel. There will
be a concern to show the relevance of the context to the question. This will be validated by relevant
and detailed quotation from the passage which will establish a coherent link between the text and
the question.

The excellent candidate will choose a passage that represents a perceptive approach to the question.
This will be carefully justified by relating the passage to the context of the novel and the direction
of the question. There will be detailed and well selected quotation which justifies the relevance of
the selected passage both to the novel and to the question. The quotations will resonate and
establish a powerful link between the text and the question.


Criteria B

The average candidate will link ideas contained in the selected passage to ideas for staging it.
In this question the importance of the character and perhaps the setting as well will be prominent
features under consideration. What is said and done in the passage by the selected character will
involve the candidate in staging decisions. These are likely to be credible but understood in
general terms. Staging choices, while interesting, may lack practicality or be a little vague.
Production effects will be part of what the candidate explores with possible reference to sound,
set design and lighting, not only as a way of registering setting but also perhaps as reflections of the
character’s mood.

The good candidate will see how ideas in the selected passage link to dramatic ideas for staging.
Ideas for staging will be practical and appropriate cognizance will be taken of the possible ways of
employing production elements in order to establish mood and setting for the character on stage.
The choice of the character will be informed and interesting and will take the importance of the
character to the wider context of the novel into account. There will be clear justification for the
staging choices the candidate adopts in clear references to the detail of the selected passage.
The exploration of the character and setting is likely to be more specific than general
with thoughtful choice of textual reference and quotation. The exploration will result in a
focused staging. There will be a sense of character development in the staging and there will be an
understanding of the importance of the audience in relation to staging decisions and a consequent
appreciation of the link between actor and audience.
                                                 –6–             N13/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The excellent candidate will immediately link ideas in the selected passage to dramatic ideas for
staging. The relationship between these ideas will be interesting and relevant to significant aspects
of the novel. Ideas for staging will be original and clearly justified; there will be a precise focus on
how production elements may be carefully employed to convey the drama of the scene to an
audience through the release of the dramatic potential of the original passage. The choice of the
character will be insightful and the accompanying setting will complement the action in an
evocative way. The exploration of character and setting will be highly specific with a
comprehensive understanding of the exercise of transformation clearly registered by the candidate
through apposite reference and quotation. There will be a strong sense for the dramatic meaning the
staging will be communicating to an audience and the direction of actor and design of setting will
clearly register this for the audience.


Criteria C

The average candidate will write clearly but there may be lapses in grammar and spelling.
These will not compromise the overall coherence of the essay. The examiner will not have to
struggle to confer meaning. The argument of the essay will be reasonably structured but may not be
entirely consistent. The candidate will usually write in quite general terms, occasionally managing
to be more specific. There will be adequate reference to the text. The register will be satisfactory
with some understanding of the two sets of terminology respectively applied while writing about
literature and performance.

The good candidate will write in a way that is clear and engaged. Lapses in grammar and spelling
will be few. Sentences will be varied in length. There will be some indication of an individual
style of expression. The argument of the essay will be structured in a way that satisfactorily
conveys meaning, sometimes of specified and detailed points. The candidate will write with
recognition of the importance of detail and there will be clear referencing to the text. The register
will be appropriate with a demonstrable understanding of the two sets of terminology respectively
applied while writing about literature and performance.

The excellent candidate will write in a way that is clear, varied and precise in the use of critical
vocabulary pertinent to literature and performance. The argument of the essay will be persuasive
with perceptive use of referencing and quotation from the novel. The structure of the essay will
enhance its persuasive qualities. The register will be effective with a use of sentence structure and
language reflecting an individual style of expression that conveys a purposeful argument in a
concise manner. The transformation will be explored in specific detail.

Question 2

Criteria A

An average candidate will choose a passage from the novel which is connected to the question.
The dominant theme will be identified. This choice of theme may not be entirely apposite.
The student is likely to justify this choice with a general attempt to put the passage and theme into
context with the rest of the novel. The candidate will be capable of selecting some relevant
quotations from the text that will go some way to justifying the choice though justifications and
rationale for choice are likely to be expressed in general rather specific terms.

The good candidate will choose a passage that is clearly relevant to the question; the dominant
theme will be clearly identified. The selection will be apposite. This choice of the passage will be
justified by placing the selected passage into an active relationship to the rest of the novel.
There will be concern to show the relevance of the context to the question. This will be validated
by relevant and detailed quotation from the passage which will establish a coherent link between the
text and the question.

The excellent candidate will choose a passage that represents a perceptive approach to the question.
The dominant theme will be clearly identified and be entirely appropriate. This will be carefully
justified by relating the passage to the context of the novel and the direction of the question.
There will be detailed and well selected quotation which justifies the relevance of the selected
passage both to the novel and to the question. The quotations will resonate and establish a powerful
link between the text and the question.


Criteria B

The average candidate will link ideas contained in the selected passage to ideas for staging it.
In this question the importance of the dominant theme and how the passage chosen may best
illustrate its dramatic potential will be a key factor. The average candidate may struggle a little to
explore the dramatic potential of the theme selected but will be able to identify dramatic aspects
of it. These are likely to be credible but understood in general terms. Staging choices,
while interesting, may lack practicality or be a little vague. Production effects will be part of what
the candidate explores with possible reference to sound, set design and lighting, not only as a way
of registering setting but also perhaps as reflections of a thematic preoccupation from the point of
view of the author. This exploration is likely to be approximate and may lack clear focus
and precision. In this sense the relationship between the dramatization of a dominant theme and its
intended effect on the audience may not be entirely clear.

The good candidate will see how ideas in the selected passage link to dramatic ideas for staging.
Ideas for staging will be practical and appropriate cognizance will be taken of the possible ways of
employing production elements to fully convey the importance of the dominant theme. The choice
of the theme should underline its dramatic significance and its overall importance in the wider
context of the novel. There will be justification for the staging choices the candidate adopts in clear
references to the detail of the selected passage. The exploration of the dominant theme will be more
specific than general with thoughtful choice of textual reference and quotation. The exploration
                                               –8–             N13/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


will result in a focused staging. There will be a sense for thematic development in the staging and
there will be an understanding of the importance of the audience in relation to staging decisions and
a consequent appreciation of the link between the theme and the action on stage.

The excellent candidate will immediately link ideas in the selected passage to significant themes in
the novel. Ideas for staging will be original and clearly justified; there will be a precise focus on
how production elements may be carefully employed to convey the drama of the scene to an
audience through the release of the dramatic potential of the original passage. The choice of the
dominant theme will be assured and thought provoking; the exploration of the dominant theme will
be highly specific with a comprehensive understanding of the exercise of transformation clearly
registered by the candidate through apposite reference and quotation. There will be a strong sense
of the dramatic meaning the staging will be communicating to an audience and the staging of the
scene will clearly register this for the audience.

Question 3

Criteria A

An average candidate will choose a passage from the novel which is connected to the question
dealing with love. The student is likely to justify this choice with a general attempt to put the
passage into context with the rest of the novel. The candidate will be capable of selecting some
relevant quotation from the text that will go some way to justifying the choice though justifications
and rationale for choice are likely to be expressed in general rather than specific terms.

The good candidate will choose a passage that is clearly relevant to the question of love and will
justify this choice by placing the selected passage into an active relationship to the rest of the novel.

Criteria B

The average candidate will link ideas contained in the selected passage to ideas for staging it.
In this question the importance of human love will be the prominent feature under consideration.
What is said and done in the passage will involve the candidate in staging decisions. These are
likely to be credible but understood in general terms. Staging choices, while interesting may lack
practicality or be a little vague. Production effects will be part of what the candidate explores with
possible reference to sound, set design and lighting, not only as a way of registering the drama of
the scene but also providing a setting for it. This exploration is likely to be approximate and may
lack clear focus and precision. In this sense the relationship between what is being played out on
stage may not be always predicated on the key relationship to the audience.

The good candidate will see how action in the selected passage link to dramatic ideas for staging.
Ideas for staging will be practical and appropriate cognizance will be taken of the possible ways of
employing production elements in order to establish the necessary setting for the drama of love
being played out. The nature of the scene and the aspect of love that is dramatized will be
interesting and significant. There will be clear justification for the staging choices the candidate
adopts with references to the detail of the selected passage. The exploration of the subject of love is
likely to be more specific than general with thoughtful choice of textual reference and quotation.
The exploration will result in a focused staging. There will be a sense of a developing action and
there will be an understanding of the importance of the audience in relation to staging decisions and
a consequent appreciation of the link between the audience and what is dramatized on stage.
