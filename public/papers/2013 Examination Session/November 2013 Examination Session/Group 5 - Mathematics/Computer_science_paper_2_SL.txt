Answer all the questions.

1.    Consider the array data and the program fragment shown below.

                  [0]       [1]     [2]       [3]       [4]       [5]
       data       -2         2       4         3         0        -1

      public double[] doIt(double[] inArray)
      {
           int n = inArray.length;
           double[] outArray = new double[n];


            for(int i=1; i<n-1; i=i+1)
            {
                 outArray[i] = inArray[i-1] + inArray[i] + inArray[i+1];
                 outArray[i] = outArray[i] / 3.0;
            }

            return outArray;
      }

      The method doIt is called by the statement double[] d = doIt(data);.

      (a)   By copying and completing the following table, trace the method doIt for this call
            and show the contents of the array outArray after each pass through the loop.          [4 marks]

                        outArray       [0]      [1]         [2]     [3]     [4]      [5]
                        Original          0       0          0       0        0       0
                        i=1
                        i=2


      (b)   State the effect of the doIt() method on the values in the array data.                  [1 mark]

      (c)   Outline why the loop cannot start and end on the indices of the first and last
            elements of the input array.                                                           [2 marks]

      (d)   Construct statements to modify the doIt() method so that the first and last
            elements of the output array are also computed. The first element of the output
            array will be the average of the first two elements of the input array. The last
            element of the output array will be the average of the last two elements of the
            input array.                                                                           [2 marks]




                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      Similarly, for the two-dimensional array data2 shown below, an average value can be
      calculated for each interior element as follows.

      The average value for the interior element marked X is the average of itself
      and its four neighbouring elements which are marked A, B, C, and D.
      (Average = (X+A+B+C+D)/5.0)

       data2       [0]      [1]      [2]       [3]      [4]      [5]
           [0]
            [1]              A
            [2]     D        X         B
            [3]              C
            [4]

      (e)   Construct a code fragment that computes the average for the value at
            data2[1][4].                                                                      [2 marks]

      (f)   The method doIt2(double[][] in2Array) fills a two-dimensional output
            array out2Array[][] so that:

                  • each interior element of the array out2Array is the average of
                    the corresponding element and its four neighbouring elements
                    (as explained above) in the array in2Array
                  • all elements on the edges of out2Array are kept at their default value
                    of zero.

            Construct the method doIt2(), which is called by the statement
            double[][] e = doIt2(data2).  It has been started below.

            public double[][] doIt2(double[][] in2Array)
            {
                 . . .
            }                                                                                 [6 marks]

      (g)   Outline how the elements on the edge of out2Array could be given values
            equal to the average of the corresponding element and its neighbouring elements
            in in2Array.                                                                      [3 marks]

2.    A program is written to help farm management.  The following class is used to create
      objects representing fields in a farm.

      public class FarmField
      {
        String fieldName;               // Unique name for the field
        int fieldSize;                  // Size of the field in square metres
        int soilType;                   // A value indicating soil acidity
        int fertilizerType;             // A value indicating the type of fertilizer
        int cropType;                   // Crop type: 1=Corn, 2=Soybeans, 3=Alfalfa, etc.
      }

      (a)   (i)    Construct an empty FarmField object named firstField.                            [1 mark]

            (ii)   Construct the statements that will assign values of a 12,000 square metre
                   field named “Back forty” to the firstField object.                               [2 marks]

            (iii) Construct the statements that will assign values, to the firstField object,
                  indicating that it has a soil acidity value of 8 and the crop type is soybeans.   [2 marks]

      The program stores the data for all the fields in a single array of FarmField objects
      called allFields[].  The size of the array exceeds the number of FarmField objects.  
      Unused elements at the end of the array are null.  The current number of fields is
      stored in the variable numberFields.

      (b)   Construct the method, findLargest(), that will return the size of the largest
            field in this array.  It has been started below.

            int findLargest(FarmField[] allFields, int numberFields)
            {
                 …
            }                                                                                       [4 marks]

      The allFields[] array is to be kept sorted so that allFields[0] is the FarmField
      object representing the largest field, allFields[1] the second largest, etc.

      (c)   Construct the method, insertField(), that will insert a new FarmField object
            at the appropriate place in the allFields[] array.                                      [7 marks]

      (d)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of the size of the array
            allFields[] being greater than the number of FarmField objects.                         [4 marks]

This question requires the use of the Case Study.

3.    (a)   Outline two precautions that a mobile device user can take to prevent their data
            from being compromised if they lose their mobile device.                           [4 marks]

      (b)   Outline two reasons why a phone designer might choose to integrate a solar
            power panel into a mobile device.                                                  [4 marks]

      (c)   Identify three reasons why many Bluetooth devices can operate in the same
            office building without interfering with one another.                              [3 marks]

      (d)   Compare the use of Ethernet with Bluetooth for data communication in
            smartphones.                                                                       [3 marks]

      Many mobile phones now have GPS integrated into them so that the user’s location
      can be sent to data services.

      (e)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of letting a mobile device transmit the
            user’s location.                                                                   [6 marks]

      (f)   Smartphones contain several different kinds of memory.

            (i)    State the type of memory in which applications (“apps”) would be stored
                   when the mobile device is powered off.                                      [1 mark]

            (ii)   Describe the function of cache memory.                                      [3 marks]

      (g)   Discuss the effects that the widespread ownership of smartphones is having
            on students.                                                                       [6 marks]
