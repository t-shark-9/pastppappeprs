                                           Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.

Using the markscheme

1     General

      Mark according to scoris instructions and the document “Mathematics SL: Guidance for e-marking
      November 2013”. It is essential that you read this document before you start marking. In particular,
      please note the following. Marks must be recorded using the annotation stamps, using the new scoris tool.
      Please check that you are entering marks for the right question.

      • If a part is completely correct, (and gains all the “must be seen” marks), use the ticks with numbers to
        stamp full marks. Do not use the ticks with numbers for anything else.
      • If a part is completely wrong, stamp A0 by the final answer.
      • If a part gains anything else, all the working must have annotations stamped to show what marks are
        awarded. This includes any zero marks.

      All the marks will be added and recorded by scoris.

2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

      • Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked,
        and marks awarded according to the markscheme.
      • It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding
        M mark(s), if any. An exception to this rule is when work for M1 is missing, as opposed to incorrect (see
        point 4).
      • Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, eg M1A1, this usually means M1 for an attempt to use
        an appropriate method (eg substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the correct values.
      • Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded independently; so if the first
        value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award A0A1A1.
      • Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks, unless there is a note.
      • Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.
      • Most M marks are for a valid method, ie a method which can lead to the answer: it must indicate some
        form of progress towards the answer.
                                                 –4–                   N13/5/MATME/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3   N marks

    If no working shown, award N marks for correct answers – this includes acceptable answers (see accuracy
    booklet). In this case, ignore mark breakdown (M, A, R).

    • Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
    • There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
      penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
    • There may not be a direct relationship between the N marks and the implied marks. There are times when
      all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks: this indicates that we want to see some
      of the working, without specifying what.
    • For consistency within the markscheme, N marks are noted for every part, even when these match the
      mark breakdown.
    • If a candidate has incorrect working, which somehow results in a correct answer, do not award the N
      marks for this correct answer. However, if the candidate has indicated (usually by crossing out) that the
      working is to be ignored, award the N marks for the correct answer.

4   Implied and must be seen marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets eg (M1).
    • Implied marks can only be awarded if the work is seen or if implied in subsequent working
        (a correct final answer does not necessarily mean that the implied marks are all awarded). There are
        questions where some working is required, but as it is accepted that not everyone will write the same
        steps, all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks for the question.
    • Normally the correct work is seen in the next line.
    • Where there is an (M1) followed by A1 for each correct answer, if no working shown, one correct answer
    is sufficient evidence to award the (M1).

    Must be seen marks appear without brackets eg M1.
    • Must be seen marks can only be awarded if the work is seen.
    • If a must be seen mark is not awarded because work is missing (as opposed to M0 or A0 for incorrect
      work) all subsequent marks may be awarded if appropriate.

5   Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer (final or intermediate) from one part of
    a question is used correctly in subsequent part(s) or subpart(s). Usually, to award FT marks, there must be
    working present and not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part. However, if
    the only marks awarded in a subpart are for the final answer, then FT marks should be awarded if
    appropriate. Examiners are expected to check student work in order to award FT marks where appropriate.

    • Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded for work which uses
      the error, but M and R marks may be awarded if appropriate. (However, as noted above, if an
      A mark is not awarded because work is missing, all subsequent marks may be awarded
      if appropriate)
    • Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.
    • If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer FT marks.
    • If the error leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the sum of an
      infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s) for the final
      answer(s).
    • The markscheme may use the word “their” in a description, to indicate that candidates may be using an
      incorrect value.
    • If a candidate makes an error in one part, but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent part(s), award
      marks as appropriate, unless the question says hence. It is often possible to use a different approach in
      subsequent parts that does not depend on the answer to previous parts.
                                                 –5–                    N13/5/MATME/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


    • In a “show that” question, if an error in a previous subpart leads to not showing the required answer, do
      not award the final A1. Note that if the error occurs within the same subpart, the FT rules may result in
      further loss of marks.
    • Where there are anticipated common errors, the FT answers are often noted on the markscheme,
      to help examiners. It should be stressed that these are not the only FT answers accepted, neither should N
      marks be awarded for these answers.

6   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). A candidate should
    be penalized only once for a particular mis-read. Use the MR stamp to indicate that this is a misread. Do
    not award the first mark in the question, even if this is an M mark, but award all others (if appropriate) so
    that the candidate only loses one mark for the misread.

    • If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer marks.
    • If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the sum of an
      infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s) for the
      final answer(s).
    • Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.

7   Discretionary marks (d)
    An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not cover the
    work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used and a brief note written next to the mark
    explaining this decision.

8   Alternative methods
    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question specifies a
    method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt, contact your team
    leader for advice.

    • Alternative methods for complete parts are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
    • Alternative solutions for parts of questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR. Where possible,
      alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these alternatives start and finish.

9   Alternative forms
    Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

    • As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
    • In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in brackets
      immediately following the answer.
    • In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations),
      will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the bracket or
      the form in brackets (if it is seen).

10   Accuracy of Answers

     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the final answer to the
     required accuracy. When this is not specified in the question, all numerical answers should be given exactly
     or correct to three significant figures

     Candidates should NO LONGER be penalized for an accuracy error (AP). Examiners should award marks
     according to the rules given in these instructions and the markscheme. Accuracy is not the same as
     correctness – an incorrect value does not achieve relevant A marks. It is only final answers which may lose
     marks for accuracy errors, not intermediate values. Please check work carefully for FT. Further
     information on which answers are accepted is given in a separate booklet, along with examples. It is
     essential that you read this carefully.

     Do not accept unfinished numerical final answers such as 3/0.1 (unless otherwise stated). As a rule,
     numerical answers with more than one part (such as fractions) should be given using integers
     (eg 6/8). Calculations which lead to integers should be completed, with the exception of fractions which are
     not whole numbers.

     Clarification of intermediate values accuracy instructions

     Intermediate values do not need to be given to the correct three significant figures. But, if candidates work
     with rounded values, this could lead to an incorrect answer, in which case award A0 for the
     final answer. However, do not penalise inaccurate intermediate values that lead to an acceptable
     final answer.

11   Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 2, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (eg TI-89) are not
     allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics SL guide says:
            Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of calculator
     notation in the working.

12   Style

     The markscheme aims to present answers using good communication, eg if the question asks to find the value
     of k, the markscheme will say k = 3 , but the marks will be for the correct value 3 – there is usually no need
     for the “ k = ”. In these cases, it is also usually acceptable to have another variable, as long as there is no
     ambiguity in the question, eg if the question asks to find the value of p and of q, then the student answer
     needs to be clear. Generally, the only situation where the full answer is required is in a question which asks
     for equations – in this case the markscheme will say “must be an equation”.

     The markscheme often uses words to describe what the marks are for, followed by examples, using the
     eg notation. These examples are not exhaustive, and examiners should check what candidates have written,
     to see if they satisfy the description. Where these marks are M marks, the examples may include ones using
     poor notation, to indicate what is acceptable. A valid method is one which will allow candidate to proceed
     to the next step eg if a quadratic function is given in factorised form, and the question asks for the zeroes,
     then multiplying the factors does not necessarily help to find the zeros, and would not on its own count as a
     valid method.

13    Candidate work

      If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way crossed out
      their work, do not award any marks for that work.

14.   Diagrams

      The notes on how to allocate marks for sketches usually refer to passing through particular points or having
      certain features. These marks can only be awarded if the sketch is approximately the correct shape. All
      values given will be an approximate guide to where these points/features occur. In some questions, the first
      A1 is for the shape, in others, the marks are only for the points and/or features.
      In both cases, unless the shape is approximately correct, no marks can be awarded (unless otherwise stated).
      However, if the graph is based on previous calculations, FT marks should be awarded if appropriate.
