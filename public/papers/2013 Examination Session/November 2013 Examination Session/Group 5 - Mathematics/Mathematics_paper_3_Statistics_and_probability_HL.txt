Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

      A traffic radar records the speed, v kilometres per hour (km h–1), of cars on a section of a road.
      The following table shows a summary of the results for a random sample of 1000 cars whose
      speeds were recorded on a given day.

            Without calculating J , explain why J ⊂ I .                                                     [2]

      A farmer is selling apples and oranges. The weights X and Y , in grams, of the apples and
      oranges respectively are normally distributed with X ~ N (180, 142 ) and Y ~ N (150, 122 ) .

      (a)   Find the probability that the weight of a randomly chosen apple is more than 1.5 times the
            weight of a randomly chosen orange.                                                                [7]

      (b)   Katharina buys 4 apples and 6 oranges. Find the probability that the total weight is
            greater than 1.5 kilograms.                                                                        [7]

      Jenny tosses seven coins simultaneously and counts the number of tails obtained. She repeats
      the experiment 750 times. The following frequency table shows her results.

            a suitable χ 2 test.

            (i)    State the null and alternative hypotheses.

      Francisco and his friends want to test whether performance in running 400 metres improves
      if they follow a particular training schedule. The competitors are tested before and after the
      training schedule.

      The times taken to run 400 metres, in seconds, before and after training are shown in the
      following table.

            Competitor                       A            B         C        D           E

            Time after training             73            69        55      72           65

      Apply an appropriate test at the 1 % significance level to decide whether the training schedule
      improves competitors’ times, stating clearly the null and alternative hypotheses. (It may be
      assumed that the distributions of the times before and after training are normal.)
