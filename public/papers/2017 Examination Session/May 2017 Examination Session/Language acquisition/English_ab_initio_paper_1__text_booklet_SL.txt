                    Start planning your budget now
         Part 1     If you want to study in Australia, it is time to think about your ﬁnances

         If you have chosen Australia as your destination for university, you will be anxious to know
         how much it will cost you. Getting a good idea of the expenses – which include tuition,
         meals, board and travel – will help you plan your budget in advance. Here’s what you
 5       need to know.

           Study costs
           The costs of studying in Australia depend on the university and the level of study you
           choose. As an international student, you must pay the fees before you start to study.
           There may be other costs, for example, for access to sports facilities and clubs and for
10         course materials.

           Scholarships to study in Australia
           There are many scholarships, grants and bursaries that can support you ﬁnancially with
           your studies in Australia. They are oﬀered by the Australian government, universities
           and other public and private organisations.

15         Internships
           Internships are temporary work placements in workplaces and universities. Internships
           can be paid or unpaid. The number of working hours each day or each week varies.



         Part 2     The Win Your Future Competition

         The Win Your Future Competition is a seven-week online competition. Students who enter
20       the competition must create a digital postcard describing their hopes for the future and how
         an Australian education can take them there.
         Seven ﬁnalists will be brought to Australia for a study tour. The winner will receive:
               One year’s free tuition
               A bursary of $15,000
25             Health insurance
               Return ﬂights to Australia
               An internship.
         The winner must regularly post a blog about his or her one-year study experience in
         Australia.

               Halloween in Canada
             Halloween is celebrated in Canada on or around 31 October.
             The ancient Celts1 believed that it is the night in the year
             when the dead can come into the world of the living.

             Irish and Scottish immigrants brought Halloween traditions         A carved pumpkin to
    5        to Canada. Some people decorate their homes and gardens            frighten your friends
             for this celebration. They may put decorations of skeletons            at Halloween!
             and ghosts in their gardens. Then they invite neighbours to
             visit the garden in order to frighten them. Other people may have parties for adults or
             children; everyone comes dressed in frightening costumes. Popular activities at parties
10           are watching horror films and trying to make guests jump in fright when they think they
             see a ghost.

             Many children go out to play trick-or-treat. They dress up as ghosts, witches, skeletons
             or other characters and visit homes in their neighbourhood. They ring doorbells and,
             when someone answers, they call out “trick or treat”. This means that they hope to
15           receive candy or other snacks. This is a “treat”. They will play a “trick” (a joke) if
             they do not get anything to eat. Usually, the children receive a treat and they do not
             play tricks.

             Children also take part in a Canadian tradition of Trick-or-Treat for Unicef 2. Instead
             of asking for candies, children collect money to support this charity. They also have
20           competitions to earn money – a competition to carve the best pumpkin, for example.
             This money helps thousands of children in many countries to receive a basic education.

             31 October is not a public [ – X – ]. Schools, organizations, businesses, stores and post
             offices are [ – 25 – ] as usual. Public transport services also run on their [ – 26 – ]
             timetables. If people are driving in the neighbourhood in the evening it is important to
25           be careful of children because some wear [ – 27 – ] costumes.

                    Interview with Mahesh Sharma
                                 Environmentalist and Photographer

         Mr Mahesh Sharma is a passionate photographer and a well-known environmentalist in our city.
         I had the opportunity to interview him during Environment Week.

             Question [ – X – ]

         I was born in Amet, Rajasthan* and went to school there. In 1970 my family moved to
         Udaipur, Rajasthan. I have two daughters. The older one is married and lives in New Zealand.
 5       The younger one is ﬁnishing her university degree in Udaipur.

             Question [ – 28 – ]

         I used to photograph the moments I loved. For example, I have taken photos of the Gangaur
         festival for almost twenty years. I like this festival because it is the only one which belongs to
         Udaipur – it is our own festival.

             Question [ – 29 – ]

         It was a small incident which changed my life. When my younger daughter was in school
10       she participated in a poster competition and wanted to make a poster on water pollution.
         She asked for my help. I decided to do something unique so I took some photos of polluted
         water going into our lakes. Later, I made a collage of all the pictures and gave it to her.
         The teacher and the students liked the poster. On that day I also realized the threat of
         polluted water to the environment. I took more photos of polluted water and made posters
15       that I showed in various places. A few days after this, a group of environmentalists used my
         posters and photographs to explain to the public what was happening to the environment.

             Question [ – 30 – ]

         Ignorance by local government and by the citizens,
         as well as poverty and illiteracy, are the main reasons.
         Secondly, we, the citizens and authorities, no longer
20       appreciate the importance of lakes. We consider
         them a place to leave garbage.

             Question [ – 31 – ]

         Poster and photo exhibitions can send a powerful message. We must also make laws to stop
         people putting rubbish in lakes.
