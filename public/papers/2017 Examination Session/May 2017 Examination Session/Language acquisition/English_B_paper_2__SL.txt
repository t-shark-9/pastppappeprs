Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.   Cultural diversity

     You have just read an article which claimed that home-schooled children tend to be more highly
     motivated and therefore perform better academically. Write a blog entry reflecting on your own
     school experience and whether you think you would have benefited from home schooling.


2.   Customs and traditions

     Every year your school organizes an excursion to an English-speaking country to learn about its
     customs and traditions. However, the trip this year lacked the cultural element. Write a report of
     the trip for the school management, explaining why you felt the cultural aspects were missing and
     suggesting some changes for future excursions.


3.   Health

     A recent survey conducted at your school revealed that many students are not getting enough
     sleep. Your teacher has asked you to give a talk to your classmates explaining the importance
     of sleeping well and suggesting ways in which sleeping habits can be improved. Write the text of
     your talk.


4.   Leisure

     You love going to the cinema. You have decided to create a film club to discuss and share films
     with other cinema fans in your local area. Write a leaflet giving information about the club and
     encouraging people to join.


5.   Science and technology

     You downloaded a new application (or “app”) for your mobile phone that you enjoyed but it had
     some problems. Write an email to the app creator in which you describe your experience of the
     app and what improvements you would recommend.
