             (decidimus) they just turn to dust and shade (pulvis et umbra). Do not accept images or

             that points out the fact that death reaches all mortals such as: Tullus was famed for his
             wealth and power, but could not evade death; Ancus was famed for his religious observance
             and military prowess, but could not evade death. An example from each king must be
             mentioned.
