                                  Indian meals and families
        Laurie David, author of The Family Dinner,
         suggests that the “art” of eating together in the
         United States has been lost, and argues that it is a
         custom that needs to be revived. David suggests
         that sitting down with one’s family for a meal is
         important for keeping family history alive and
         helping children acquire proper manners. Besides,
         the practice helps them reach higher levels of
         self-esteem and academic achievement.

        Unlike the United States, there is a broader general awareness amongst people of all ages and
         regions of the importance of a sit-down family meal in India. Namrata Nandakumar, a university
         student, says, “Food is important here, and we try to have all meals together as a family. It’s the
         time when we interact and share things about our day.”

        Madhu Gadia, a renowned cuisine expert, says that in India food is something that is simply
         meant to be eaten with the family. She says, “it’s very rare for people to eat by themselves,” and
         adds that cooking is just something that people take huge pride in.

        Gadia also states that the great value placed by families on a unique, secret spice recipe, which
         is kept by each and passed down through the generations, is a source of pride for many Indians.
         She explains, “Families seem to have their own little mixtures of how they season the food…
         everybody seems to have their own. Those are your own personal family blends.” Gadia adds
         that this unique part of Indian identity seems centred on each family: “I’ve never heard anyone
         say ‘this is my in-law’s garam masala*’.”

        Nikhat Aslam, a university professor, explains  [ – X – ]  cooking has helped her  [ – 2 – ]  with
         her two sons over the years. “Often, when there are guests home for larger dinners or
         gatherings, both my boys will  [ – 3 – ]  help me put things together in the kitchen…It’s easy
         to bond, talk about problems and  [ – 4 – ]  offer words of wisdom when sprinkling dressing
         over chicken. It’s far easier than sitting face-to-face and having that serious talk with ‘mother’.
         Cooking has helped  [ – 5 – ]  interesting and long lasting bonds  [ – 6 – ]  my family,” she said.

                     An interview with organic farmers
         What is it like to be an organic farmer?
         What better way to find out than to ask
         two of the leading organic farmers across
         Australia, Gerard and Deborah.

 5       What do you do on your farm?                                    Removed for
         We produce organic grass-fed beef and we                      copyright reasons
         add value to this product by making beef
         pies.

         [–X–]
10       We were certified for several years, but
                                                        Gerard and Deborah from Nicholls Rivulet
         in recent years we felt being certified
                                                        Organic Farm.
         made little difference to the demand for
         our products. We have always farmed
         organically and sustainably and we felt that we did not need to pay for the privilege of doing so.
15       The feedback on the taste and the quality of our products support our decision.

         [–8–]
         Animal care and well-being are an integral part of the quality of the food we produce.
         The farming method used promotes good health for our animals. We have chosen the best
         slaughterhouse* even though it costs more.

20       [–9–]
         Genetic modification has a lot of hype around superior production. We have concerns about it
         and the long term impact on soil and, in turn, human health.

         What is the main challenge you face growing organic products?
         Because we are a small farm, our main challenge is keeping up with the demand for
25       our products.

         [ – 10 – ]
         The organic certification system in Australia is too costly for the small producers; more and
         more local growers are choosing not to be certified.

         [ – 11 – ]
30       Read as much as you can, look at everything, try different things and be patient
         and perseverant.

         NOMOPHOBIA: a rising trend
         Tim Elmore
         September 2014

         Whenever I find myself needing something in order to cope,
         I always check my lifestyle and my health. This may sound crazy, but
         my rule is that I don’t allow myself to be brought under the control of
         anything. Outside of food, water and shelter, I guard myself against
 5       subjection to any addiction that begins to dictate my behavior. This
         includes technology. I recognize that technology makes my life easier
         and it enables me to work more efficiently. My principle, though, is this:
         technology should be a servant, not a master!

         Nomophobia is the fear of being without a mobile device, and it’s on
10       the rise among today’s high school and college students, to the extent
         that the average adolescent would rather lose a pinky-finger than a
         cell phone! Many of them also prefer texting or tweeting to actually
         talking to others…

         The term Nomophobia is an abbreviation for “no-mobile-phone phobia,”
15       which was coined during a 2010 study. They found that about 58
         percent of males and 47 percent of females suffer from this phobia, and
         an additional 9 percent feel stressed when their mobile phones are off.
         Interestingly, the study found that the stress levels caused by the average
         case of Nomophobia are much the same to those of “wedding day jitters”
20       and trips to the dentist.
                                              –5–                 M17/2/ABENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/T


                In the U.S., Nomophobia’s gotten worse. Let’s review:

                • 65 percent, about two in three teenagers, sleep next to their
                  smart phones.
                • One in five teens would also rather go without shoes for a week
25                than take a break from their phone.
                • About half never switch off their phone.

                So what should we do to achieve a balanced approach?

                • Be sure there are daily times when you turn off the cell phone and
                  either have face-to-face conversations or be in solitude.
30              • Balance screen time and in-person time each week. For every
                  hour you invest in front of a screen, you invest another in human
                  contact.
                • Try a technology fast every month, where you actually go for a
                  day or more without a computer, tablet or phone. This may
35                sound hard, but it’s worth trying it from time to time!

                Do you see signs of Nomophobia in yourself? What else would you add
                to my list above? Leave a comment below!
