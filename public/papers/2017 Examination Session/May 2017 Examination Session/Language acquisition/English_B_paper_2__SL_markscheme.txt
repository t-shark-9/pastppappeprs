You must make sure you have looked at all pages. Please put the          annotation on any
blank page, to indicate that you have seen it.

When using the On Page Comments annotation, please keep the following in mind:
 • Avoid covering the candidate’s own writing. This can be done by writing your
    comments in the margins then running the arrow attached to the ‘on-page comment’
    annotation to the appropriate place.
 • Provide all comments in the target language.
 • You may provide summative comments at the end of the script, but please do NOT
    record numerical marks on the scripts.

Criterion A: Language

• How effectively and accurately does the student use language?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is generally inadequate.
   1–2     A very limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are rarely clear.
           Command of the language is limited and generally ineffective.
   3–4     A limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are sometimes clear.
           Command of the language is generally adequate, despite many inaccuracies.
   5–6     A fairly limited range of vocabulary is used, with many errors.
           Simple sentence structures are usually clear.
           Command of the language is effective, despite some inaccuracies.
   7–8     A range of vocabulary is used accurately, with some errors.
           Simple sentence structures are clear.
           Command of the language is good and effective.
   9–10    A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately, with few significant errors.
           Some complex sentence structures are clear and effective.


Clarification

Word count
At SL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words. Failure to write the minimum
number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under criterion A. The whole text should be taken
into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have few language gaps, and slips or flaws rarely affect meaning.

          The message has not been communicated.
          The ideas are irrelevant and/or repetitive.

          The message has barely been communicated.
          The ideas are sometimes irrelevant and/or repetitive.
   3–4
          The development of ideas is confusing; supporting details are limited and/or not
          appropriate.
          The message has been partially communicated.

          appropriate.
          The message has been communicated fairly well.

Question 1: Cultural diversity

school experience and whether you think you would have benefited from home schooling.

          whether home schooling would have benefitted them) OR both parts of the question
          (reflecting on own school experience and whether home schooling would have
          benefitted them) in a confusing manner (N.B. “cover” means “in more than two
          sentences”)

          provided
        • makes very little or no use of paragraphing and cohesive devices.

          sentences”)
        • reflects superficially and with basic detail on own experience using one or two ideas

          noticeable digression into other aspects eg social skills, friends, time management,
          etc

 5–6      them or not. (Superficial link is made to motivation and academic performance)

          whether home schooling would have benefitted them) with some detail OR both
          parts of the question (reflecting on own school experience and whether home
          schooling would have benefitted them) in a superficial or basic manner
        • supports the arguments provided using few explanations and examples. Examples
          should be predominantly based on personal experience(s)
        • uses few paragraphs and cohesive devices to structure the development of the
          ideas presented.
        • focuses on the context of their own school experience with little digression into
          schooling methods in general
        • reflects on own experience using at least two clear ideas related to motivation and
          academic performance) presented with some detail. Little digression is made into
          other general aspects e.g. social skills, friends, time management, etc)
        • explains clearly and with some detail whether home schooling would have been
          beneficial for them or not (in terms of motivation and academic performance)
 7–8    • addresses both parts of the question (reflecting on own school experience and
          whether home schooling would have benefitted them) competently and with some
          detail

          Examples should be predominantly based on personal experience(s)
