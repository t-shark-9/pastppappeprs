General marking instructions

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where
     it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
     awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
     comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
     additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
     question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to
     a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
     enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp “SEEN” on any page that contains no other annotation.

8.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
     this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
  semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                     explanation etc.

     read/write speed;
     Cache memory is static RAM and this memory doesn't need to be constantly refreshed;        [2]


5.   The OS allocates (and deallocates) specific sections of memory to each
     program/process/module;
     This ensures that the memory assigned to one program is not overwritten;
     Uses secondary/virtual memory to allow more processes to run simultaneously;
     Note: Do not accept vague reasons.                                                         [2]

7.   Some compression methods (lossy) discard data;
     Decompression will not return the complete file/some detail will have been removed;
     Which in some cases eg audio/video may be unacceptable;
     If original not saved/lost there is no way to recover it;                                  [3]

              Find/calculate the midpoint/median value between HI and LOW;
              If the array value at midpoint equals the search value; then the search value
              is found;

            Paging allows similar-sized sections of data;
            identified by specific addresses;
            To be swapped between RAM and secondary memory/storage;

            Example answer:
            Main memory is divided into page files/swap files/sections so that data from these sections
            can be transferred to and from secondary storage. The addresses of these sections in main
            memory are linked to virtual addresses in secondary memory and the links stored in a table.
            When a page is needed, the table is accessed to recall the page into the correct locations in
            main memory.                                                                                [2]

            The listed software would require a lot more RAM to run efficiently;
            Paging/VM would be regularly used;
            In order to load the required modules;
            Thus slowing down the operation of the laptop;
            The laptop does not have a dedicated graphics processor;
            Which would be required for a multimedia game;
            This would result in low quality graphics;                                                  [3]

      (c)   A stack is a LIFO data structure;
            In the game it allows the “undo” function to work / movements/steps can be retraced;

      Note: Do not give any marks if the proposed structure is not dynamic.

      A binary search tree could hold a series of nodes each of which contains the data for each
      reading;
      and two pointers (to the left and right child);
      Each node is inserted according to the temperature, higher temperature to the left, lower to
      the right;
      An in-order traversal would output the data sorted in descending order of temperature;

      Note: Linked list would not minimise processing but should get credit.

            An embedded system is a system that performs a specific/dedicated function;
            For a larger system for which it is physically part of:
            In this example, the control system is actually part of the electric motor;              [2]

      (b)   To control the output (values);

            OR
            To control the system performance/behaviour of the system/;
            by routing back the output values as input values;

      (c)   Award up to [6 max].
            The desired speed is set/inputted and the (speed) sensor / input transducer measures the
            (current output) speed;
            This analog signal (from the speed sensor) is converted into digital;
            And sent back to the controller/processor;
            The error/difference between the output speed and desired/input speed is calculated and
            compared to pre-set values to determine whether speed should be adjusted;
            If the speed/power should be adjusted by an amount dependent upon the error then signal is
            sent to the output (transducer);
            The above process is repeated continually;                                              [6]

      (d)   The sensor sends an interrupt to the operating system;
            When it measures a value outside of the normal range;
            Such as an abnormal temperature/pressure;
            The operating system sends a signal to operate an actuator (output transducer);
            In order to bring the system back to normal;                                            [5]
