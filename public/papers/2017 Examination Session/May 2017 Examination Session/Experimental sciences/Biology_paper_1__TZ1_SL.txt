      What is the reason that cladograms based on DNA sequences are more reliable predictors of the
      phylogenetic relationship of species than cladograms based on protein sequences?

      A.    Amino acids are not as chemically stable as DNA nucleotides.

      B.    DNA mutates but amino acids do not.

      C.    Several different triplets of bases can code for the same amino acid.

      D.    There are 20 different amino acids but only 4 nucleotides.
