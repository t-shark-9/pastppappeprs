Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Design consultants Teague and Sizemore worked together to create the Denny Bike, an urban bike with
auto-shifting, electric assist, smart lighting and an integrated lock, see Figure 11 and Figure 12. The bike
was created in response to a competition from a manufacturer to create a new and innovative product.
Taking into account the environment that the bike will be used in, the designers will have had to carefully
consider what materials and production processes to use. Through assessing the needs of potential users
in this environment, the team has incorporated both radical and incremental developments within the
overall product.
