General marking instructions

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-
     hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check (✓) must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
     awarded. When marking Question 4, use the RM™ Assessor underline tool to underline key parts,
     and then use the textbox tool to add a comment stating which band the response is in, as well as any
     supporting explanation.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
     comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
     additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
     question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to
     a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
     enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp “SEEN” on any page that contains no other annotation.

8.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
     this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.


General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
  got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
  minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
  accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.

• Question 4 is marked against markbands. The markbands represent a single holistic criterion applied
  to the piece of work. Each markband level descriptor corresponds to a number of marks. When
  assessing with markbands, a “best fit” approach is used, with markers making a judgment about
  which particular mark to award from the possible range for each level descriptor, according to how
  well the candidate’s work fits that descriptor.

General guidance

 Issue             Guidance
 Answering         • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity      • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses        eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include
 prescribed in       two descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 the questions     • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
                     explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                     This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation
                     etc.

1.   Award up to [4 max].
     Marks are awarded for:
     What is Boolean logic?
     What is Fuzzy Logic?
     Why would fuzzy logic be appropriate? / Why wouldn’t Boolean logic be appropriate?
     What would the use of fuzzy logic achieve?

     Boolean logic requires precise inputs/1s and 0s;
     Fuzzy logic operates with partial truths/imprecise data/values between 0 and 1/probabilities;
     Precise data may not always be available (or might lead to a wrong diagnosis)/imprecise data
     might (more) accurately reflect the condition/situation (allow an example);
     Fuzzy logic (through these partial truths/etc.) can give a definite answer/course of action/higher
     truth/more accurate diagnosis/ranked by probabilities (NOT just statistics);                    [4]


2.   Award up to [4 max].
     Marks are awarded for:
     Identifying the use of RFID;
     Outlining the role of NFC [2 marks];
     Describing the beneficial consequences up to [2] marks;

     RFID tags can be used to identify the patient;
     NFC enabled sensors/transducers/wearables can record patient data (allow example);
     Which can be transmitted to a nearby NFC reader/smartphone;
     Which can alert the patient (for whatever reason eg take medicine);
     And/or transmit this data (via the WAN) to the doctor/hospital (Note: given in Case Study),
     thereby eliminating/reducing the need for the patient to be in a hospital because the
     hospital/doctor can be alerted in the case of an emergency/can monitor the patient’s health; [4]

     Note: for the last mark point it must be clear that the data is being used in some way.

3.   (a)   Award up to [4 max].
           Marks are awarded as follows:
           The importance
                  ▪ The meaning of interoperability [1 mark];
                  ▪ Why it is important in this scenario [1 mark];
           The issues
                  ●   Award [1 mark] for each issue that is outlined up to [2 max];
                  ●   Award [1 mark] for identifying 2 issues if no issue has been outlined;

           The importance – [2 max]:
           EHR systems require data to be transferable between different systems/used on different
           platforms/systems (hardware and software) to be compatible;
           So that the data is accessible in different areas or countries/health care systems are
           compatible / so patients can be treated wherever they are/so data can be (easily)
           analysed/accessed in any centre/country OR allow an example that demonstrates the
           importance;



           The issues – [2 max]:
           Systems will use different hardware/OS/software/languages/formats so they will have to
           change to a common format;
           Changing systems will be expensive/time consuming;
           If a new system is introduced staff will have to undergo re-training;
           Databases might be different so data would have to be stored in a common format/put in a
           common place (cloud);
           Translation systems would have to be put in place so that all data is understandable;
           There might be problems in getting the different parties to agree on a particular standard; [4]

(b)   Award up to [6 max].
      Marks are awarded as follows:
      Award up to [2] marks for each advantage and each disadvantage that is clearly discussed
      up to 3 issues (3x2). Award [1] mark for only identifying/outlining an issue. To gain 5 or 6
      marks at least 1 advantage and 1 disadvantage must be addressed. Accept one answer from
      each of the following categories.

      Advantages for the patients
      Patients can be treated more effectively + good reason, eg as their past history can be seen
      including any medication/allergies they might have by any health worker with legitimate
      access;
      Doctors/nurses/ambulance etc. can get quick access to patient details;
      Should save time in deciding appropriate treatment;

      Advantage for the administrators
      Prospective donors can be located more easily as there will be a larger pool of potential
      donors;

      Advantage for researchers
      Having a large database of patients with the whole range of characteristics / ailments will
      greatly help in epistemological studies / bioinformatics;

      Disadvantages for the patients
      There will be privacy issues, as the medical data will now not be restricted to local health
      centres but made available potentially across countries. More chance of data being misused
      / hacked + consequence;
      Combining current systems into one interoperable system may result in errors /
      misunderstandings as not all systems are the same. This could lead to dangerous problems
      due to wrong diagnosis;

      Disadvantages for the administrators / doctors
      Putting the system in place is expensive in terms of money and time.
      Costs of systems / re-training;
      This might take money from other parts of the health budget;                             [6]

4.   Award up to [12 max].

     Technologies to be considered, but not limited to:
     Telemedicine, Tele surgery, 3D bioprinters, Robotics, Augmented Reality, Wearables/NFC,
     (Expert Systems), DDSS/CDSS;

     Discussion should include (with technical details):
     The way in which EHR, imaging in diagnosis and improved fuzzy logic based systems
     can increase reliability of expert systems, which could improve doctors’ diagnoses/change
     the way they work;
     The interpretation of images that are more complex/informative means that staff may need
     retraining or be replaced by technical experts. Technical retraining may be required for
     doctors and surgeons to use read and interpret the technology;
     An explanation of augmented reality and its effect on surgery;
     An explanation of robotic surgery and the reduced need for expert surgeons – surgeon skills
     will be different/less manual;
     Conclusion may predict the change of doctors and surgeon’s jobs and whether there will be a
     reduction in numbers and change in conditions;

     Note: We need to limit this to the use of technology about which we already know / which is
     already in development and not to consider any speculations about what might happen in the
     future.

     Note: The candidate should focus on changes that would impact upon the doctors rather
     than patients.
