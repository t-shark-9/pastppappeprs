Option A — Databases

1.   A school stores details about the parents of its students in a database management system.

     (a)   Outline two reasons for choosing to use a database for this storage.                      [2]

     (b)   Identify one item of data that would be stored in this database management system.        [1]

     (c)   Outline a technique that could be used to reduce data input errors.                       [2]

     One of the functions of the system is to allow parents to pay for their children’s school
     lunches online. Parents are notified, by email, with the amount that they owe. After
     payment, a confirmation is sent to the parent by email.

     (d)   Describe the interaction between the parent and the database management system
           when processing a payment.                                                                [5]

     (e)   Explain how the database is accessed when many parents pay online at the same
           time.                                                                                     [3]


2.   (a)   Define the term relational database.                                                      [1]

     (b)   Explain the role of entity-relationship diagrams when modelling data.                     [4]

     TABLE_1 and TABLE_2, shown below, are taken from a school’s relational database.
     TABLE_1 holds data about all of the students at the school and TABLE_2 holds data about
     participants in the school chess club. The tables’ primary keys are underlined.

                                                  TABLE_1
                                    Student_ID        EmailAddress
                                         12           fred@mail.com
                                         34            ng@mail.com

                                                  TABLE_2
                              Member_ID           Student_ID       Position
                                    1                12            Captain
                                   13                34           Secretary
                                   11                21            Member

     (c)   Limited to the data shown, outline an issue that may arise when using the tables.         [2]

     (d)   (i)   Describe an issue that could occur after deleting, in TABLE_1, the record for the
                 student whose Student_ID is 12.                                                     [2]

		(ii)           With reference to the situation in part (d)(i), outline which property of data
                 ensures that, in a relational database, the deletion of records has no unwanted
                 effects.                                                                            [3]

(Option A continues on the following page)
                                                   –3–                    M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

(Option A continued)

3.   A phone company stores the SMS text messages that are sent between its own subscribers
     and only these subscribers.

     • Each subscriber that sends messages has an associated data structure where details of
       their SMS text messages are stored.
     • The sender’s phone number and name, followed by the details of each individual SMS
       text message are collected as they occur.
     • The details stored for each SMS text message are the receiver’s phone number, name
       and text message.

     For example, consider the following two data structures:

                            1111, fred, 1234, smith, Hi there, 1234, smith, Call me, …
                            1234, smith, 1111, fred, Later, …

     The first data structure is associated to a sender whose phone number is 1111, and has sent
     two SMS text messages to another subscriber whose phone number is 1234.

     The second data structure is associated to a sender whose phone number is 1234, and
     currently contains the details of just one message.

     (a)   With reference to the data organization in the two examples,

		(i)           outline one limitation of using a table to store this collection of data exactly as it is
                illustrated.                                                                                [2]

		(ii)          construct a single table that could store all the data for each message separately,
                for each subscriber. Your answer should include the example data shown above.               [4]

     (b)   Define the term data redundancy.                                                                 [2]

     (c)   Construct two tables to remove any data redundancy from part (a)(ii).                            [4]

     (d)   Using the tables from part (c), suggest the steps for a query to obtain, for any SMS text
           message, the name of the receiver.                                                               [3]

     The phone company hires a database administrator.

     (e)   Outline one function that a database administrator should perform regularly.                     [2]

     (f)   Discuss an ethical issue that could arise if external agencies could obtain and analyse
           the phone company’s data.                                                                        [3]




                                        End of Option A

                                                                                                    Turn over
                                                    –4–                 M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.   A local sports league arranges a series of games between four teams over one year.
     Each team plays every other team 10 times. Using the number of games won and
     lost in previous years, a table of probabilities is calculated and held in an array PROB.
     The contents of PROB is represented by the following diagram.

                        PROB                   1          2      3        4
                                      1                0.5       0       0.5
                                      2       0.2               0.8      0.5
                                      3       0.9      0.1               0.4
                                      4       0.3      0.5      0.4

     The content of PROB[2, 3] is 0.8 and indicates that the probability of team 2 winning
     against team 3 is 0.8. For the 10 games played between these two teams it is likely
     that team 2 will win 8 of them.

     (a)   With reference to the table, state the probability of team 3 winning against team 2.      [1]

     PROB[i, j] is the probability of team i winning against team j.

     (b)   Using this notation, identify the probability of a draw between team i and team j.        [2]

     (c)   State the total number of games that each team plays in one year.                         [1]

     Based on these probabilities, a table is set up in a spreadsheet to store the expected number
     of games that each team will win and lose this year.

     The table, PROB10, is in the same format using rows 1–4 and columns A–D as shown
     below.

                      PROB10                   A          B       C       D
                                      1                   5       0       5
                                      2        2                  8       5
                                      3        9          1               4
                                      4        3          5       4

     A macro is created, in this spreadsheet, to calculate and store the expected number of
     draws for each team, so that cell A1 holds the total number of times team 1 is expected
     to draw, B2 holds the total number of times team 2 is expected to draw and so on.

     (d)   With the use of an illustration, demonstrate the processes that would be carried out
           by the macro.                                                                             [3]




(Option B continues on the following page)
                                                   –5–                    M17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

(Option B, question 4 continued)

     During the year, results of each game are used to complete a separate table, PLAYED.
     For each team, PLAYED stores the number of games lost, won and drawn against each
     other team in a format similar to PROB10.

     After each game, information including the team numbers and scores, is sent in the form
     i, j, m, n. For example 2, 3, 6, 1 indicates that team 2 scored 6 and team 3 scored 1.

     (e)   Using the data i, j, m, n construct an algorithm to insert the correct data into the table
           PLAYED. You can assume that the table contains zero values at the beginning
           of the year.                                                                                  [4]

     Each team is ranked based on how many games they have won that year.
     This is then compared with the data in the expected tables.

     (f)   With reference to this scenario, distinguish between a mathematical model and a
           simulation.                                                                                   [4]

     (g)   Discuss the benefits of comparing the expected results with the actual results.               [4]

5.   A reservoir is being planned, to provide water for a local town. A simulation is carried out to
     aid the planning process.

     • The initial volume in the reservoir is preset to an appropriate level.
     • The input will be from rivers and will vary according to the climate.
     • The output will be through a large pipe that is large enough to carry enough water
       for the daily needs of the people in the town.

     To avoid the reservoir exceeding a dangerous level, a series of outlets are planned to
     divert water away from the reservoir if the level of water reaches a certain limit.

     The following variables, each calculated at the same moment in time, are used in
     the simulation:
     yy V represents the volume of water in the reservoir
     yy R represents the volume of input from the rivers and any rainfall
     yy T represents the volume of output via the pipe that sends water to the town
     yy E is the excess volume emptied through the planned outlets, if the volume in the reservoir
        exceeds D.

     The volume that must not be exceeded is represented by D, and its value is fixed.

     (a)   State the relationship between V and D that avoids any danger.                              [1]

     The simulation is used to determine the volume of water that needs to be emptied through
     the outlets when the danger level of the reservoir is reached.

     (b)   Describe the factors to consider when identifying suitable ranges of values of R, T and
           E to use in the simulation.                                                                 [6]

     The results of the simulation are to be displayed graphically showing the estimated water
     level.

     (c)   Discuss the way in which a series of graphs could be created over time, and interpreted.    [6]

     Software is used to design the reservoir incorporating all points at which water can
     enter and exit the reservoir and all materials to be used.

     (d)   Explain how the results of the simulation could be used to help the design of the
           reservoir.                                                                                  [4]

6.   (a)   Outline a situation where 2D visualization would be more appropriate than
           3D visualization.                                                                          [2]

     An artist is planning to create a statue, but decides to do some planning before she starts.

     (b)   Outline the advantages, to the artist, of using a computer aided design (CAD) and
           graphic processing software for 3D modelling, instead of a series of sketches drawn by
           hand, to experiment with designs.                                                          [3]

     (c)   Outline the basic steps used in the process of rendering to give a 3D visualization of
           the final proposed statue.                                                                 [4]

7.   An e-business, X-Sprintz, sells running shoes online. The web pages of their website contain
     several elements.

     (a)   Outline two reasons why X-Sprintz would put their banner across the top of their
           web pages.                                                                                [4]

     (b)   Identify one piece of information that might be present in the footer of X-Sprintz’s
           web pages.                                                                                [1]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A large company with locations in different cities has taken an OOP approach in creating an
administration program that manages all aspects of its business. These aspects include:
yy the sale of all of the different products that the company manages
yy the salaries for managers, office staff and sales personnel.

10.   (a)   By making use of an example from the above scenario, distinguish between a class
            and an instantiation of a class.                                                        [3]

      The different modules in the program each open up a graphical user interface (GUI).
      Each GUI has a similar design, but contains differences specific to each module.

      (b)   By giving two examples, explain how the principles of inheritance can be incorporated
            into the design of this administration program.                                         [4]

      (c)   Describe how the use of libraries can facilitate the development of programs
            like this company’s administration program.                                             [3]

11.   The company employs several sales personnel to sell its products to different retailers.
      Each branch of the company keeps track of its own sales with a suite of programs that
      include the two classes SalesPerson and Sales.

      class SalesPerson // each object contains details of one salesperson
      {
        private String id;
        private Sales[] salesHistory; // details of the different sales
        private int count = 0;				 // number of sales made

       //constructor for a new salesperson
       public SalesPerson(String id)
       {
      		 // code missing
       }
            // constructor for a salesperson transferred (together with
            // their sales details) from another branch
       public SalesPerson(String id, Sales[] s, int c)
       {
      		 // code missing
       }
            public int getCount(){return count;}
            public String getId() {return id;}
       public void setSalesHistory(Sales s)
       {
      		 salesHistory[count] = s;
      		 count = count + 1;
       }
       public double calcTotalSales() // calculates total sales for the
      														 // salesperson
       {
      		 // code missing
       }
         public Sales largestSale() // calculates the sale with the largest
       													// value
         {
      		 // code missing
         }
       }

      Each instance variable is initialized when a SalesPerson object is instantiated.

      (a)     Complete the constructor public SalesPerson(String id), from the
              SalesPerson class.                                                                 [2]

      (b)     Explain why accessor methods are necessary for the SalesPerson class.              [3]

     (c)     (i)   Construct unified modelling language (UML) diagrams to clearly show the
                   relationship between the SalesPerson and Sales classes.
                   Note: There is no need to include mutator or accessor methods or a constructor.     [4]

		(ii)             Outline a negative effect that a future change in the design of the Sales object
                   might have on this suite of programs.                                               [2]

     The company employs several sales personnel. The different salesPerson objects are held
     in the array salesPeople.

     The Main class contains various methods that operate on the SalesPerson and Sales
     classes. The array salesPeople is declared globally. The Main class contains the following
     code:

     SalesPerson[] salesPeople = new SalesPerson[6];
     salesPeople[0] = new SalesPerson("100");
     salesPeople[1] = new SalesPerson("101");
     salesPeople[2] = new SalesPerson("102");
     salesPeople[0].setSalesHistory(new Sales("A100",300.00,10));
     salesPeople[0].setSalesHistory(new Sales("A200",1000.00,2));
     salesPeople[1].setSalesHistory(new Sales("A300",2550.40,10));
     System.out.println(salesPeople[2].getId());
     System.out.println(salesPeople[0].getCount());
     System.out.println(salesPeople[1].getSalesHistory(0).getValue());
     System.out.println(salesPeople[0].calcTotalSales());

     (d)     State the output after running this code.                                                 [4]

     (e)     Construct the method calcTotalSales(), in the SalesPerson class that calculates
             the total value of the sales for a specific SalesPerson object.                           [5]

     The salesPeople array contains 100 instantiated objects.

     The company wishes to reward the salesperson whose sales have the largest total value.

     (f)     By making use of any previously written methods, construct the method highest(),
             that returns the ID of the salesperson whose sales have the largest total value.          [5]

     (g)   Construct the method addSales(Sales s, String id), in the Main class, that will
           add a new Sales object s, to the salesperson with a specified ID.
           Note: You can assume that the ID is a valid one.                                         [4]

     A further class in this suite of programs is the Payroll class. This class is run at the end
     of each month to calculate each salesperson’s salary, which is based on the sales that have
     been made during that month.

     (h)   Suggest changes that must be made to the SalesPerson class and/or the Sales
           class to allow these calculations to be made.                                            [3]
