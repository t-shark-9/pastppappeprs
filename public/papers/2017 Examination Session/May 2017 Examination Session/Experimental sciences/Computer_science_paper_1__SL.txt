                                                Section B

Answer all questions.

11.   A large company has taken over another business. This takeover has required various
      changes to be made. One of the changes requires data migration.

      (a)   (i)   Define the term data migration.                                                          [1]

		(ii)            Describe two problems, concerning data migration, which the company may
                  have to overcome.                                                                        [4]

      (b)   Other than data migration, describe two aspects of change management that may
            arise from this takeover.                                                                      [4]

      The company produces industrial chemicals. One of the chemical processes is represented
      by the following logic diagram.


      A
                                                    OR
                                                                          X

                      B                                                                AND             C

                                                                          Y
                                                  NAND


      (c)   (i)   Construct the truth table corresponding to this diagram.                                 [3]

		(ii)            Identify the single logic gate that is equivalent to this diagram.                       [1]

      (d)   Outline how truth tables can be used to test that any two logic diagrams are equivalent.       [2]




                                                                                               Turn over
                                                      –4–                     M17/4/COMSC/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

12.   (a)   By copying the table below, trace the following algorithm using the data in the
            collection DATA. Note: B and C are also collections and are initially empty.

		 DATA = {2,4,-1,3}
		 loop while DATA.hasNext()
			 A = DATA.getNext()
			 if A >= 0 then
				 if A mod 2 = 0 then
					B.addItem(A)
				else
					C.addItem(A)
				end if
			  end if
		end loop

                                                                              Contents      Contents
            DATA.hasNext() ?          A    A >= 0?       A mod 2 = 0?
                                                                                of B          of C




                                                                                                                [3]

      (b)   Outline the steps involved in performing a binary search on an array of ascending
            numbers. Note: you can assume that the search value is present in the array and that
            initially LOW is the index of the first value in the array and HI is the index of the last value.   [4]

      (c)   A collection called NUMBERS is to be searched to see if it contains a specified value.  
            Construct an algorithm in pseudocode to perform the following:
            yyinput the number, S, to be searched for
            yyread in the values from the NUMBERS collection into the array D. Note: you can
               assume that the array is large enough and that the collection is not empty
            yyperform a linear search for S on the array D
            yyoutput the message “found ” or “not found ” as appropriate.                                       [5]

      A binary search can be performed on the array D, if the values in D are in ascending order.
      As the values are being read from NUMBERS into D they are checked to see if they are in order.

      (d)   Without writing pseudocode, suggest how this check could be performed.                              [3]

13.   A multinational business requires secure communication between its offices in different
      countries. The business’s salesforce also needs secure remote access, as they travel the
      world.

      (a)   (i)   Identify two different types of network that can be combined to use the internet
                  to address the above requirements.                                                 [2]

		(ii)            For one of the networks identified in part (a)(i), describe the security
                  characteristics that are particular to this network.                               [3]

      Packet switching is used for sending data over the internet.

      (b)   Discuss the importance of protocols in ensuring the successful preparation,
            transmission and delivery of data using packet switching.                                [6]

      (c)   Describe two advantages to society of the increased availability of WiFi outside the
            home.                                                                                    [4]
