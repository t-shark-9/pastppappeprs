Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Answers must be written within
the answer boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by
suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

1.   The lengths of trout in a fisherman’s catch were recorded over one month, and are
     represented in the following histogram.

                          30 cm < trout length ≤ 40 cm
                          40 cm < trout length ≤ 50 cm
                          50 cm < trout length ≤ 60 cm
                          60 cm < trout length ≤ 70 cm
                          70 cm < trout length ≤ 80 cm                         1

     (b)   State whether length of trout is a continuous or discrete variable.                         [1]

     (c)   Write down the modal class.                                                                 [1]

     Any trout with length 40 cm or less is returned to the lake.

     (d)   Calculate the percentage of the fisherman’s catch that is returned to the lake.             [2]

5.   The company Snakezen’s Ladders makes ladders of different lengths. All the ladders that
     the company makes have the same design such that:

           the first rung is 30 cm from the base of the ladder,
           the second rung is 57 cm from the base of the ladder,
           the distance between the first and second rung is equal to the distance between all
           adjacent rungs on the ladder.

     The ladder in the diagram was made by this company and has eleven equally spaced rungs.

                                                                 diagram not to scale




                                                             57 cm
                                       30 cm



     (a)   Find the distance from the base of this ladder to the top rung.                       [3]

     The company also makes a ladder that is 1050 cm long.

     (b)   Find the maximum number of rungs in this 1050 cm long ladder.                         [3]

7.   Sara regularly flies from Geneva to London. She takes either a direct flight or a non-direct
     flight that goes via Amsterdam.

     If she takes a direct flight, the probability that her baggage does not arrive in London is 0.01.
     If she takes a non-direct flight the probability that her baggage arrives in London is 0.95.

     The probability that she takes a non-direct flight is 0.2.

8.   Daniela is going for a holiday to South America. She flies from the US to Argentina stopping
     in Peru on the way.

     In Peru she exchanges 85 United States dollars (USD) for Peruvian nuevo sol (PEN).
     The exchange rate is 1 USD = 3.25 PEN and a flat fee of 5 USD commission is charged.

     (a)   Calculate the amount of PEN she receives.                                                                             [3]

     At the end of Daniela’s holiday she has 370 Argentinean peso (ARS). She converts this back
     to USD at a bank that charges a 4 % commission on the exchange. The exchange rate
     is 1 USD = 9.60 ARS.

     (b)   Calculate the amount of USD she receives.                                                                             [3]

14.   Arthur and Jacob dream of owning a speedboat that costs 35 300 euros (EUR).

      Arthur invested x EUR in an account that pays a nominal annual interest rate of 3.6 %,
      compounded monthly. After 18 years he will have 35 300 EUR in the account.

      (a)   Calculate the value of Arthur’s initial investment, x . Give your answer to two decimal
            places.                                                                                                                [3]

      Jacob invested 9000 EUR for n years. The investment has a nominal annual interest rate of
      3.2 % and is compounded quarterly. After n years, the investment will be worth 35 300 EUR.

      (b)   Find the value of n .                                                                                                  [3]
