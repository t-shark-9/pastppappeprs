Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular,
solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example,
if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     (b)   The hyperbola with equation x2 - 4 xy - 2y2 = 3 is rotated through an acute
           anticlockwise angle α about the origin.

                 hyperbola in terms of X and Y .


                                                                                          1
