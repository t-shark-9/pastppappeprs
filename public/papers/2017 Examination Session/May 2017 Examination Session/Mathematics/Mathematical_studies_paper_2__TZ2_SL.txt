Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

     In a school, all Mathematical Studies SL students were given a test. The test contained four
     questions, each one on a different topic from the syllabus. The quality of each response was
     classified as satisfactory or not satisfactory. Each student answered only three of the four
     questions, each on a separate answer sheet.

     The table below shows the number of satisfactory and not satisfactory responses for each
     question.


                                                         Topic from the syllabus

     (a)     If the teacher chooses a response at random, find the probability that

             (i)     it is a response to the Calculus question;

             (ii)    it is a satisfactory response to the Calculus question;

             (iii)   it is a satisfactory response, given that it is a response to the Calculus question.   [6]

     (b)     The teacher groups the responses by topic, and chooses two responses to the Logic
             question. Find the probability that both are not satisfactory.                                 [3]
