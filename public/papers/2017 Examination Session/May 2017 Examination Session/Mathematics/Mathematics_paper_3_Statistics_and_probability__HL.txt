Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     A farmer sells bags of potatoes which he states have a mean weight of 7 kg . An inspector,
     however, claims that the mean weight is less than 7 kg . In order to test this claim,
     the inspector takes a random sample of 12 of these bags and determines the weight, x kg ,
     of each bag. He finds that
                                  ∑  x = 83.64 ; ∑  x 2 = 583.05 .

     You may assume that the weights of the bags of potatoes can be modelled by the normal
                   (     )
     distribution N µ , σ 2 .

     (a)   State suitable hypotheses to test the inspector’s claim.                                  [1]

     (b)   Find unbiased estimates of µ and σ 2.                                                     [3]

     (c)   (i)   Carry out an appropriate test and state the p-value obtained.

		(ii)           Using a 10 % significance level and justifying your answer, state your conclusion
                 in context.                                                                         [6]

     A teacher decides to use the marks obtained by a random sample of 12 students in
     Geography and History examinations to investigate whether or not there is a positive
     association between marks obtained by students in these two subjects. You may assume
     that the distribution of marks in the two subjects is bivariate normal.

     (a)   State suitable hypotheses for this investigation.                                          [1]

     He gives the marks to Anne, one of his students, and asks her to use a calculator to carry out
     an appropriate test at the 5 % significance level. Anne reports that the p-value is 0.177 .

     (b)   State, in context, what conclusion should be drawn from this p-value.                      [1]

     (c)   The teacher then asks Anne for the values of the t-statistic and the product moment
           correlation coefficient r produced by the calculator but she has deleted these. Starting
           with the p-value, calculate these values of t and r .                                      [5]
