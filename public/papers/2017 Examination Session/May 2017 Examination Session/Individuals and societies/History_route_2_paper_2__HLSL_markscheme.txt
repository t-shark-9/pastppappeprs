Markbands for paper 2

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
 10–12     The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
 7–9       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
           historical context.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant. The response makes links
           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
 4–6       The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
           understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
 1–3       There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1     Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Discuss the developments that affected the trade of two societies, each from a different region.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the developments that affected the trade
     of two societies. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the
     two societies need not be contemporaneous. However, each of the examples chosen must be
     from a different region. The developments that are discussed may or may not be applied to both
     societies and they may be considered to have had a largely positive impact, a largely negative
     impact, or a mixed impact on the trade of those societies. Each society may be considered
     separately or, where appropriate, a thematic approach may be used if candidates wish to compare
     the relative importance of specific developments that affected the trade of both their chosen
     societies.



 2. Evaluate the significance to cultural and intellectual developments of two individuals.

     Candidates will appraise the significance to cultural and intellectual developments of two individuals
     from the period indicated by the timeframe of this topic. The individuals chosen may have been
     influential in art, philosophy, literature or other intellectual endeavours or alternatively, have risen to
     prominence due to their contributions to science. The two individuals chosen need not be
     contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the same state or region. Candidates
     may explain the significance of the figures by indicating the impact they had during their lifetime.
     However, it may be that the examples chosen gained greater prominence in later periods.
     Knowledge will be used to address their significance and for this to go beyond a description of their
     work. Each figure may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted if
     candidates choose to compare the degree of significance.
                                                 –7–                 M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of medieval wars (750-1500)

3.   Examine the significance of two leaders to the course/practice of warfare.

     Candidates will consider the significance of two leaders in terms of their impact on the course
     and/or practice of warfare during the period indicated by the timeframe of this topic. The two
     individuals chosen need not be contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the
     same state or region. Although the focus of candidates’ responses will be to uncover the
     interrelationship between the leaders’ actions and the course/practice of warfare in which they
     were engaged, other factors may be introduced to contextualise and/or gauge the significance of
     the chosen leaders. Each leader may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be
     used if candidates wish to compare the relative significance of the two leaders to the
     course/practice of warfare.



4.   “Demographic change was the most significant effect of war.” Discuss with reference to two wars.

     With reference to two wars, candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the
     hypothesis that demographic change was the most significant effect of war. While the focus of the
     response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars need not be contemporaneous
     and they may or may not be chosen from the same state or region. The hypothesis must be
     discussed and consideration given to how far it may be argued that demographic change was the
     most significant effect of war. Other factors may be introduced to support arguments that may or
     may not agree with the hypothesis. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic
     approach may be used if candidates wish to compare the relative importance of relevant factors for
     each war.
                                                  –8–                 M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 3    Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.    With reference to two rulers, compare and contrast the methods used to consolidate their rule.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the methods used by
      two rulers to consolidate their rule, referring to both rulers throughout the response. While the
      focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two rulers chosen need not be
      contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the same region. Methods to be
      considered may include legislation, the use of force or the use of patronage, and may have been
      effective or ineffective or a combination of both. The response must not be a descriptive list of
      methods without some assessment of how these were used by the chosen rulers.



 6.   To what extent did one ruler overcome the internal and external challenges to their power?

      Candidates will consider the extent to which their chosen ruler overcame both internal and external
      challenges to their power. These challenges may be addressed chronologically or they may be
      addressed in terms of their perceived severity. Alternatively, the extent to which the challenges
      were surmounted may be the focus of the response. There may also be an attempt to address the
      challenges thematically (for example, internal versus external challenges and/or social, political
      and economic challenges). While candidates must refer to both internal and external challenges,
      depending on the ruler chosen, the coverage of these need not be equal. In some cases, it may
      be possible for candidates to draw parallels between internal and external challenges, for example
      external support for internal challenges and/or internal support for external challenges.
                                                 –9–                 M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4 Societies in transition (1400-1700)

7.   Discuss the developments that affected the trade of two societies, each chosen from a different
     region.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the developments that affected the trade
     of two societies. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the
     two societies need not be contemporaneous. However, each of the examples chosen must be
     from a different region. The developments that are discussed may or may not be applied to both
     societies and they may be considered to have had a largely positive impact, a largely negative
     impact, or a mixed impact on the trade of those societies. Each society may be considered
     separately or, where appropriate, a thematic approach may be used if candidates wish to compare
     the relative importance of specific developments that affected the trade of both their chosen
     societies.



8.   "Religion was more often a support than a challenge to states." With reference to two states, to
     what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the extent to which the religion of two states was more often a support
     than a challenge to those states. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of
     this topic, the two states need not be contemporaneous. The two states may or may not be
     chosen from different regions, and the religion(s) of the states in question may or may not be the
     same religion(s). In each case, candidates must clearly identify the religion(s) and the ways in
     which those religions supported and/or challenged the respective states. Each state may be
     considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if candidates wish to compare the level
     of support and/or hindrance that the state enjoyed or endured.
                                                   – 10 –                M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450-1789)

9.    “The expansion of early modern colonial empires was motivated by economic factors.” Discuss with
      reference to two early modern colonial empires.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis with reference made to
      two early modern colonial empires. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe
      of this topic, the two colonial empires need not be contemporaneous. Further, the two colonial
      empires may or may not be chosen from different regions. Candidates must identify the reasons
      why the colonial empires expanded, and gauge the importance of economic factors in this context.
      Candidates may determine that economic factors were the most significant motivation in one or
      both states or, alternatively, argue that other factors were of equal or more importance in one or
      both states. Each colonial empire may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be
      used if candidates choose to address the impact of a range of factors on the candidates’ chosen
      colonial empires.



10.   Discuss the methods used to maintain power in two colonial states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the methods used to maintain power in
      two colonial states. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the
      two states chosen need not be contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the
      same region. Additionally, the colonial states/territories chosen may have been ruled by the same,
      or different, colonial powers. Candidates will avoid discussion of how power was gained unless it
      directly affects the methods that were employed after colonial power had been established.
      Methods to be considered may include administrative, political, religious, military, legal or cultural.
      Candidates may choose to follow a comparative approach, organized around methods, or they
      may choose to discuss the two societies separately.
                                                 – 11 –               M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500-1750)

11.   Evaluate the importance of religion in causing two wars.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the role of religion in causing two Early Modern wars. While
      the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars chosen need not
      be contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the same region. While religious
      causes must be the focus of the response, depending on the wars chosen, other factors may be
      discussed in order to provide context for the evaluation. It may, for example, be argued that
      religion was the catalyst for one or both wars, but that other factors had a significant long-term
      impact. Alternatively, it could be argued that religion was the underlying cause but that other
      factors acted as the catalyst. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach
      adopted to weigh the significance, or otherwise, of religion in relation to other relevant factors.



12.   “Technological developments were the most significant factor in determining the outcome of early
      modern wars.” Discuss with reference to two wars.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis with reference made to
      two Early Modern wars. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic,
      the two wars need not be contemporaneous. Further, the wars may or may not be chosen from
      different regions. Candidates must identify the factors that determined the outcome of early
      modern wars and gauge the importance of technological developments factors in this context.
      Candidates may determine that technological developments were the most significant motivation,
      alternatively, they may argue that other factors were of equal or more importance in one or both
      wars. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if candidates
      choose to address the role of a range of factors.
                                                   – 12 –                M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   “Industrialization was entirely the result of technological development.” With reference to two
      countries, each from a different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the hypothesis that technological development
      was the sole cause of industrialization. While the focus of the response must be within the
      timeframe of this topic, the industrialization of the two selected countries does not need to be
      contemporaneous. However, the two countries must be from different regions. Candidates must
      address the role of technological development and consider the ways in which it contributed to
      industrialization. Candidates may also consider other factors that may or may not have contributed
      to, or facilitated industrialization, for example the imposition of industrialization by a government,
      using pre-existing technologies, in order to become more competitive or to meet internal and/or
      external challenges. Each country may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be
      used where candidates wish to compare the relative importance of technological development for
      each country.



14.   Evaluate the social and political impact of industrialization in one country.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the social and political impact of industrialization in one
      country. While both the social and political implications of industrialization must be dealt with in the
      response, the treatment of each does not necessarily have to be equal. Candidates may choose
      to deal with social and political implications separately and possibly conclude that the impact of
      one or other was more significant. Alternatively, candidates may deal with the question
      thematically and gauge how individual issues, for example the migration from countryside and the
      proliferation of factories had a social and/or political impact. There may also be an attempt to deal
      with the issues chronologically, with candidates possibly suggesting that the social impact of
      industrialization was a contributory factor to political change.
                                                 – 13 –               M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800-2000)

15.   Compare and contrast the methods used to achieve independence in two countries, each from a
      different region.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the methods used to
      achieve independence in two countries referring to both countries throughout the response. While
      the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the achievement of
      independence does not need to be contemporaneous. However, the two countries must be from
      different regions. Methods considered may include the use of force, political campaigning, or
      appeals to international audiences. Where methods used were similar, candidates may also
      address the extent to which those methods were more or less effective in the fight for
      independence in one country than they were in the other.



16. “Political problems were the most serious challenge to new states in the first 10 years of
    independence.” Discuss with reference to two states.

      With reference to two states, candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the
      hypothesis that political problems were the most serious challenge to newly independent states.
      While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the achievement of
      independence in those two states does not need to be contemporaneous and they may or may not
      be chosen from the same region. The hypothesis must be discussed and consideration given to
      how far it may be argued that political problems were the most serious challenge. Other factors
      may be introduced to support arguments that may or may not agree with the hypothesis. Each
      state may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if candidates wish to
      compare the relative importance of relevant factors for each state.
                                                    – 14 –                M17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 9: Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   To what extent did social and economic factors encourage the demand for democratic reform in
      one state?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that social and economic factors
      encouraged the demand for reform in their chosen state. While the focus of the response must be
      within the timeframe of this topic, if the democratic reform took place at the beginning of the period,
      then some material immediately prior to 1848 is permissible. The focus of the response must be
      on the extent to which social and economic factors encouraged the demand for democratic reform.
      However, depending on the state chosen, candidates do not have to give each area equal
      treatment. Candidates may also consider other factors that may or may not have been of greater
      or lesser importance. Social and economic factors may be dealt with separately or a thematic
      approach may be used where candidates gauge the relative social and economic importance of an
      event or issue.



18. Evaluate the impact on society of the economic policies used in two democratic states.

      Candidates will appraise the impact of economic policies on the societies of two democratic states.
      While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two societies chosen
      need not be contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the same region. The
      impact of the economic policies, including their strengths and limitations, will be appraised. Such
      appraisal could include, but need not be limited to, the social impact of the policies and/or their role
      in boosting or reducing each state’s financial position and the resulting impact on the society of
      each state. Each state may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if the
      candidates choose to compare aspects of the policies used.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19. “The conditions in which authoritarian states emerged were mainly determined by economic
    factors.” Discuss with reference to two authoritarian states.

    Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that economic factors
    were the most significant determinant of the conditions in which authoritarian states emerged.
    While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the emergence of the
    two selected states does not need to be contemporaneous. Candidates must address the role of
    economic factors and consider the ways in which they affected the conditions in which authoritarian
    states emerged. Candidates may also consider other factors that had an impact on those
    conditions, for example, the social structure or the political organization of the states. Each state
    may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used where candidates wish to
    compare the relative importance of economic and other factors for each state.



20. Compare and contrast the methods used to maintain power in two authoritarian states, each from a
    different region.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the methods of
     maintaining power that were employed in two authoritarian states referring to both states
     throughout the response. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this
     topic, the periods covered do not need be contemporaneous. However, each of the examples
     chosen must be from a different region. Methods to be considered might include, but need not be
     limited to, political, legal or social methods. These may have been effective or ineffective or a
     combination of both but the response must not be a descriptive list of policies, for example, without
     some assessment of how these helped or hindered the maintenance of power within each state.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   “The influence of foreign powers determined the outcome of 20th-century civil wars.” Discuss with
      reference to two wars.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that the outcomes of two
      20th-century civil wars were determined by the influence of foreign powers. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars chosen need not be
      contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the same region. Candidates may
      determine that the influence of foreign powers was the most significant factor in the outcome of
      one or both wars or alternatively argue that other factors were of equal or more importance in one
      or both wars. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if the
      candidates choose to compare the ways in, and the extent to, which foreign influence played a
      role.



22.   “The effects of war on the role and status of women were mostly beneficial.” Discuss with
      reference to two wars.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars chosen need not be
      contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen from the same region. Candidates may
      determine that the effects of their selected wars did lead to an improvement in the role and status
      of women or, perhaps, that one or both of the wars had the opposite effect. Each war may be
      considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if the candidates choose to compare
      the impact of war on the role and status of women.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   To what extent did economic interests rather than ideology lead to the breakdown of the grand
      alliance between 1943 and 1949?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that economic interests rather than
      ideology led to the breakdown of the grand alliance during the period from 1943 and 1949. While
      the focus of the response must be on the extent to which economic interests rather than ideology
      played a more significant role in this context, candidates may agree or disagree with the
      supposition. They may also suggest that other factors may have been of greater or equal
      importance and that the breakdown of the grand alliance was, instead, the result of a combination
      of factors and events. Economic interests and ideology may be dealt with separately, or
      candidates may use a chronological approach that outlines the breakdown of the grand alliance
      and places both economic interest and ideology in the wider context.



24.   Evaluate the impact of Cold War tensions on two countries (excluding the USSR and the US).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of Cold War tensions on two countries of their
      choice. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of the Cold War, the impact
      on the two countries does not need to be contemporaneous and they may or may not be chosen
      from the same region. The candidates must not use either the USSR or the US as these are
      excluded in the History Guide. Candidates may choose to deal with the impact of Cold War
      tensions on each country separately. Alternatively, candidates may deal with the question
      thematically and gauge how individual issues affected the two states in the same or different ways
      and/or to the same or a different extent. There may also be an attempt to deal with the issues
      chronologically.
