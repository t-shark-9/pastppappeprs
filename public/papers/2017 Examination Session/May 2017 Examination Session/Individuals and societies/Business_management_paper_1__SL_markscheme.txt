                                               Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to Utopia, describe the importance of two external stakeholders
           (line 12).                                                                                [4]

           External stakeholders could be:
           • Suppliers – the local business in particular and coffee suppliers. The business
              relies on the quality of these products
           • Local craftsmen – can be considered different from suppliers
           • Customers – this is in the service industry and customers are critical. Word-of-
              mouth is so important in this industry and these will tend to be influential people
           • Banks, etc – unlikely to be important as the business does not use external
              finance
           • The government – very important for regulations such as H&S. Also collects
              taxes so has an impact on profits.
           • Local community – Utopia provides work, has focus on local suppliers
           • Pressure groups/media – no obvious importance although bad publicity to be
              avoided
           • Competitors are allowed as external stakeholders

           N.b.: shareholders are not external. Do not reward comments about stakeholders in
           general – there has to be references to specific stakeholders


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each correct stakeholder identified and [1] for a description of how that
           stakeholder relates to Utopia. Award a maximum of [2] per stakeholder.

     (b)   With reference to Utopia, explain the role of promotion (line 6).                         [6]

           Promotion will have to be very focused to be effective.

           Two aspects of promotion:
           • Providing information: This is an upmarket business offering quite a different
             kind of tourist service. Potential customers will want to know a great deal about
             the specialities, such as locally produced goods and services, local cuisine, local
             culture, luxurious facilities and services
           • Persuasion: Probably important early in the life of the business but less so as
             word-of-mouth promotion will now be a critical way to get new customers (C2C).
             How many customers are return visitors? Advertising through public relations
             may well be important, as tourist destinations often appear in travel pages of
             newspapers.

           Creating, maintaining, reinforcing the ‘upmarket’ brand and image is important.
           Promotion may not be quite as important as for other tourist destinations because its
           focus is going to be on a niche market.

           Accept any other relevant application.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of promotion is mainly descriptive but
in context.

For full marks the explanation needs to be developed and in context.

2.   (a)   With reference to JAC, describe two advantages of internal growth (line 52).           [4]

           Internal growth: selling more; widening product range; expanding facilities

           • JAC is a relatively small enterprise relative to Utopia so it would not be too
             difficult to raise the resources to grow JAC internally.
           • John Ariki’s philosophy is for internal growth.
           • Because of the emphasis on local culture, specialised coffee, etc, it is important
             for JAC to retain control – control might be diluted with external growth.
           • With outside influences the vision for JAC might be diluted.
           • JAC is part of Utopia so the vision for Utopia is relevant.
           • Gaining economies of scale e.g. bulk buying coffee for the whole business
             Remember: JAC is owned as a sole trader


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each advantage identified, and [1] for the development of each of
           these key aspects in the context of JAC/Utopia/John, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   With reference to John, explain the key functions of management.                       [6]

           Key functions of management are:
           • setting objectives and planning
           • organising resources to meet objectives, including staff recruitment
           • directing and motivating staff
           • coordinating activities
           • controlling and measuring performance.

           With reference to John:
           • He created the original business plan.
           • He made decisions about reflecting local culture and resisting external
             stakeholders.
           • He organises local suppliers.
           • It was his decision to open café.
           • He creates crisis management and contingency plans.
           • He decides on options.
           • He delegates to his children but keeps the reigns.
           • He organised and managed a meeting between himself, Liza and Paul.
           • He monitors performance.
           • He sets organisational structure and manages changes.
           • He makes the final decision.

           Accept any other relevant analysis.


           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.
           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of functions is mainly descriptive but
           in context.

           For full marks the explanation needs to be developed and in context.

3.   (a)   With reference to Utopia, describe two suitable sources of finance for the 3D
           printers (line 60).                                                                         [4]

           Relative to the size of Utopia, the cost of the printers is not large.

           Sources could include:
           • retained profits – but are these sufficient after the problems of 2016?
           • sale of assets – but are there any? The villas are only just being rebuilt and the
             café is growing
           • reductions in working capital – impossible to say but it does seem an efficient
             organization
           • loans – although John does not want external influences, he is thinking that he
             will have to look outside. Loans would dilute his control the least. Debentures are
             unrealistic. Debt factoring
           • joint ventures, strategic alliances, franchising would seem rather unsuitable for
             the 3D printing as it is a small project. Would anyone be interested?
           • Shares: Unlikely to be suitable as John owns 100% of shares and does not want
             external influences
           • Hire purchase/leasing – would this be available from 3D printer manufacturers?
           • Can also consider grants

              Shares not acceptable as John owns 100% of shares. Remember, Utopia is a
              private limited company

           Accept any other relevant point.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each source identified, and [1] for the development of each of these
           sources in the context of the project, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Explain the role of ethics in John’s businesses.                                            [6]

           Ethical objectives are difficult to define and vary from culture to culture; however, the
           following might be regarded as ethical/socially responsible:
           • using local craftsmen
           • focussing on local culture
           • using local ingredients
           • using ethically produced fair trade coffee and paying above market prices.

           Importance relates to:
           • maintaining the goodwill of the community
           • maintaining the goodwill of suppliers, employees
           • maintaining the brand image (perhaps the most important).
           • Aiming to improve long term success and profitability of the business

           Accept any other relevant analysis.


           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.
           Award a maximum of [5] if the analysis is mainly descriptive but in context.

           For full marks the explanation needs to be developed and in context.

                                               Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term variable cost.                                                            [2]

           Variable costs are costs that vary in direct proportion to change in output/level of
           production.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar
           to the answer above.

     (b)   With reference to Utopia, explain the differences between secondary sector
           activities and tertiary sector activities.                                                [4]

           Secondary sector: manufacturing – converting raw materials. Usually capital
           intensive, often B2B – 3D printing.
           Tertiary sector activities – providing services. Usually labour intensive, often B2C.
           Predominant in developed economies – serving coffee, providing resort facilities.

           Award [1] for each difference identified, and [1] for the development of this
           difference in the context of Utopia.

           Award a maximum of [2] if the answer is not about differences but only provides
           definitions.


     (c)   Using the information above, calculate the payback period and the average rate of
           return (ARR) for the 3D printing project (show all your working).                         [4]

(d)   Using information from the case study, additional information above and your results
      from part (c), recommend whether Utopia should proceed with the 3D printing project.      [10]

      For:
      • Paul likes the idea
      • Unique souvenirs
      • Cost reductions
      • $10k is not large in the scale of the operation
      • Use of recycled materials fits in with Utopia’s ethos and image
      • ARR reasonable (14 %) – allow OFR

      Against:
      • Payback period quite long (OFR) for such a small project
      • Does this market really do souvenirs?
      • Liza does not like
      • Recruitment difficulties
      • Impact on local people – part of the ethos
      • Costs of recycling unclear
      • Not suited to niche market?
      • This is a very small investment (10K) and the returns at 14% actually amount to
        quite a small sum – if it is a success it actually adds very little to annual revenue
        streams. For such a small return is the risk that it perhaps cheapens the image
        of the business worthwhile? Such souvenirs could be regarded as “tacky” and do
        not fit the profile of the target market.

      Decision depends on John and whether other alternatives are better, eg doing
      nothing, leaving the money in the bank, etc. John believes the technology will bring
      other benefits, which may swing him that way; however, the impact on local
      craftsman would weigh heavily.


      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 6.

      Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer or with no effective use of
      case material.
      Award a maximum of [5] if only one side of argument is considered in context.
      Award a maximum of [6] if both sides are considered but there is limited use of data.
      Award a maximum of [8] if both sides considered, and there is good use of data.
      For full marks two sides of the argument should be considered, data used
      effectively, and the recommendation supported.

      Note – a recommendation that a decision cannot be made due to lack of information
      (eg market research) can be regarded as a decision provided the arguments are
      supported.
