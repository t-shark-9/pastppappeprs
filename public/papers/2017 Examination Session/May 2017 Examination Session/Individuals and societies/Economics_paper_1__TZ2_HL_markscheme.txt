1.   (a)       Explain how an increase in the costs of factors of production would affect the market
               price and output of a good.                                                             [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definitions of factors of production, market price
               • diagram to show the effect of an increase in costs of factors of production
                 (leftwards shift of supply)
               • explanation of why an increase in costs of factors of production will
                 decrease product supply and ceteris paribus increase the price and reduce
                 output
               • examples of costs of factors of production increasing.

(b)   Discuss the view that perfect competition is a more desirable market structure than
      monopoly.                                                                             [15]

      • definitions of market structure, perfect competition and monopoly
      • diagram(s) to show the differences between perfect competition and
        monopoly
      • explanation that perfect competition has a number of advantages like lower
        prices, greater choice and allocative and productive efficiency compared
        with monopoly
      • examples of markets which have features of perfect competition and
        monopoly
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: reference to benefits of monopoly such as
      economies of scale, research and development, natural monopoly, and/or the
      disadvantages of monopoly (higher price, lower output). To focus on the word
      “desirable” in the question, discussion may also include the advantages and
      disadvantages of perfect competition.

(b)   Discuss whether an increase in interest rates is the most effective way of reducing
      the rate of inflation in an economy.                                                  [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of interest rates and rate of inflation
      • diagram to show how an increase in interest rates will reduce AD, leading
        to a decrease in the price level
      • explanation of how an increase in interest rates will reduce borrowing and
        spending, leading to a reduction in C and I
      • examples of interest rate policy
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the limitations of monetary policy like time lags and
      the independence of the central bank. Also, the effectiveness of monetary
      policy may be reduced if inflation and interest rates are already very high.
      In addition there may be reference to alternative policies like fiscal policy and
      supply-side policies.

(b)   Discuss the view that the most significant consequence of unemployment is the loss
      of tax revenue for the government.                                                   [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of unemployment and tax revenue
      • diagram to show possible consequence on AD of decreases in government
        tax revenue and therefore government spending
      • explanation of how increased unemployment will decrease tax revenue and
        may lead to a budget deficit and/or a reduction in government spending
      • examples of consequences of unemployment
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the other economic and personal and social
      consequences of unemployment, eg loss of GDP, increased cost of
      unemployment benefits, greater disparities in the distribution of income or an
      increase in government spending due to falling tax revenues and increased
      unemployment benefits acting as an automatic stabilizer.
