Answer one question.

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and, where relevant, large,
well drawn maps, sketches and diagrams.

1.   (a)   Explain how the actions of world trading organizations and financial institutions (such
           as the International Monetary Fund) influence global financial flows.                     [10]

     (b)   Discuss the economic and environmental consequences of more people choosing to
           buy locally produced food and goods rather than globalized products.                      [15]


2.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the role civil societies play in national resistance to global
           interactions.                                                                             [10]

     (b)   Examine the ways in which the world’s cities and their societies are becoming
           increasingly uniform.                                                                     [15]


3.   (a)   Explain why the increasing needs of some countries for one or more raw materials are
           a cause of environmental concern.                                                         [10]

     (b)   “People living in the world’s most peripheral regions do not experience a ‘shrinking
           world’.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?                                 [15]
