Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain why an increase in incomes over time may lead to an increase in
               demand for some goods but a decrease in demand for other goods.                   [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definitions of demand, normal goods, inferior goods
               • diagram(s) to show an increase in demand (rightward shift) for normal
                 goods and a decrease in demand (leftward shift) for inferior goods
               • explanation of these rightward and leftward shifts
               • examples of normal and inferior goods.

(b)   The income elasticity of demand for primary commodities tends to be relatively low,
      while the income elasticity of demand for manufactured goods and services tends to
      be higher. Examine the likely effects of this for individual producers and for the
      economy as a whole.                                                                   [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of income elasticity of demand (YED), primary, manufacturing
        and service sectors
      • diagram(s) to show the significance of YED for primary goods,
        manufactured goods, and services using demand and supply diagrams
      • explanation of how different values of YED (high and low) may affect the
        three main sectors of the economy
      • examples of YED affecting the allocation of resources
      • synthesis or evaluation (examine) of the significance of YED for individual
        producers and the economy as a whole.

      Examination may include: the differences in YED in developed and less
      developed economies, the importance of YED at different stages of
      development, the values of YED may change over time, the relative growth
      rates of different economies and the impact on YEDs.

      • explanation of how monetary policy can be used to reduce inflation by
        reducing AD by affecting consumption and investment
      • examples of where monetary policy has been used to reduce inflation
      • synthesis and evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the importance of the type of inflation, the ability to
      adjust interest rates incrementally and relatively quickly, the significance of
      time lags, possible conflicts with other objectives of economic policy, such as
      inflation and growth.

4.   (a)   Explain the causes of economic growth in terms of an increase in actual
           output and an increase in potential output.                                       [10]

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of economic growth, actual output and potential output
           • diagram(s) to show an increase in actual output (a movement from a point
             within to a point closer to the PPC or an increase in AD); and an increase in
             potential output (shift of the PPC outwards or an increase in LRAS)
           • explanation of an increase in actual output through changes in AD and an
             increase in potential output through changes in LRAS
           • examples of the two different types of growth.

(b)   Discuss the view that the consequences of economic growth are always
      beneficial.                                                                           [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • diagram(s) to show the show the consequences of growth could include
        AD/AS and negative externality diagrams
      • explanation of the different consequences of growth including the impact on
        living standards, unemployment, inflation, the distribution of income, the
        current account of the balance of payments, environmental consequences
        and sustainability
      • examples of such consequences in practice
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: a consideration that growth is “always” beneficial, the
      overall costs of growth in relation to its overall benefits, the costs and benefits
      of growth in terms of the nature of goods produced, how growth might widen
      the distribution of income, short-term versus long-term consequences of
      growth and the link between growth and development.
