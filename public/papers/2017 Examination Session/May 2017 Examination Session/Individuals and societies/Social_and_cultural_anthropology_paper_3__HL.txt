Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools
of thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic
illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Compare the work of two anthropologists in relation to one of the following perspectives:
      structure-centred
      synchronic
      particularistic.


2.   Discuss why an anthropologist would choose to use one of the following perspectives:
      universalistic
      diachronic
      agency-centred.


3.   Discuss the importance of either an idealist or a materialist perspective in the study of one of the
     following:
      globalization
      moral systems
      gender relations.


4.   Evaluate the contribution of either a cohesion-centred or a conflict-centred perspective to an
     understanding of the nature of society.


5.   Examine how one school of thought and one theoretical perspective inform the work of one
     anthropologist.
