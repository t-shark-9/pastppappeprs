Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error
   in calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later
   question parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure
   rule” and you should put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this. To do this
   you will need to use the OFR annotation

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02
   command terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full
   credit should be given.


1.   (a)   Define the term increasing returns to scale.                                                    [2]
      Level                                                                                        Marks
      0           The work does not meet a standard described by the descriptors below.            0
      1           Vague definition.                                                                1
                  For the idea that if input/inputs are increased, there is a large increase in
                  output / an increase in productivity
                  OR that average costs fall as output increases.
      2           Accurate definition.                                                             2
                  For stating that an increase in all inputs leads to a proportionately greater
                  increase in output
                  OR that an increase in all inputs by x% leads to a greater than x%
                  increase in output.

     (b)   Using the data in Table 1 to support your answer, identify how changes in inputs
           may result in constant returns to scale and in decreasing returns to scale.                     [2]

           Constant returns are seen when output increases from 3000 to 4000 units (33 %
           increase in inputs and output).
           Decreasing returns are seen if output increases from 4000 units – increase in inputs
           – 25 % and then 20 %, while output increases by 20 % and then 14.6 %.

           OR by taking ratios of inputs and output (ie that 5/4 = 100/80 = 30/24 = 4800/4000 =
           1.25)

           For identifying and illustrating one of these OR for identifying but not illustrating
           both.                                                                                           [1]

           For identifying and illustrating both.                                                          [2]

           Any valid combination of inputs used should be accepted. A candidate who focuses
           on one factor of production only may be awarded a maximum of [1].

     (c)   Determine:

           (i)      marginal revenue when output is equal to 4 units.                                      [1]

                    $0 or 0                                                                                [1]

           (ii)     average revenue when output is equal to 6 units.                                       [1]

                    $50                                                                                    [1]
                                                 –6–              M17/3/ECONO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      (iii)   economic profit if output is equal to 2 units and average cost is equal to $130
              per unit.                                                                         [1]

              $40                                                                               [1]

              Candidates who provide an answer of $20 per unit may not be awarded a
              mark here but should NOT be penalized in part (h) for the same error (giving
              the answer as “per unit”).

(d)   Calculate the marginal revenue resulting from a fall in price from $8 to $6.              [2]

              =                                                                                 [1]

      Any valid working is sufficient for [1] so either 24 or 12 would be sufficient.

      = $2                                                                                      [1]

      An answer of $2 or 2 without workings is sufficient for [1].

(e)   Calculate the price elasticity of demand when price falls from $10 to $8.                 [2]

      OR an answer of 3 (or –3) if the midpoint method is used.

      An answer of 5 (or –5) without any valid working is sufficient for [1] only.

      Correct use of negative sign for ∆P may be present but is not necessary.
                                                 –7–                   M17/3/ECONO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(f)   Explain why a profit-maximizing monopolist would never choose to operate on the
inelastic portion of its demand curve.                                                          [4]

      When demand is price inelastic, a decrease in output / increase in price will:
      • increase total revenue                                                                  [1]
      • decrease output and therefore total costs                                               [1]
      • increase profit.                                                                        [1]

      Therefore, the profit-maximizing monopolist would never choose to produce on
      the inelastic portion of its demand curve, as profit could always be increased
      by raising price.                                                                         [1]

      Responses which state that if demand is inelastic an increase in output will cause
      revenue to fall [1] and therefore profits will fall [1] may be awarded a maximum
      of [2].

      OR an accurate explanation such as the one below may be fully rewarded:

      MR = MC is a condition for profit maximization.
      MC must be a positive number, so MR must be positive at the profit-maximizing
      level of output.
      If MR is positive, then demand must be elastic.

(g)   State two characteristics of monopolistic competition.                                    [2]

      •   low or zero barriers to entry
      •   many firms
      •   product differentiation/some price-setting power
      •   the firms are small, relative to the size of the industry.

      Award [1] for each valid characteristic up to a maximum of [2].

(h)   Calculate Firm B’s short-run profit/loss at the profit-maximizing level of output.        [2]

      350 X (16 – 20)                                                                           [1]

      Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      = –$1400 (or a loss of $1400)                                                             [1]

      An answer of $1400 or 1400 without workings is sufficient for [1].

      $4 with working should be awarded [1] for valid working.

      If the candidate provided a “per unit” answer in part (c)(iii) and again here, do not
      penalize again.

(i)       Using the diagram on page 8, explain how long-run equilibrium will be reached.                [4]

                 descriptors below.
      1          The response is limited.                                                  1–2
                 For an explanation that losses incurred will force some firms to
                 leave the industry.
      2          The response is accurate.                                                 3–4
                 For an explanation that losses (of $1400) incurred will force some
                 firms to leave the industry. As a result, the demand curve faced
                 by remaining firms will shift to the right (reducing losses). The
                 process will continue until remaining firms make normal profits.

          If there is no reference to the diagram (losses or $1400), a maximum of [3] may be
          awarded.

(j)       With reference to the diagram on page 8, outline whether allocative efficiency will be
          achieved in the long run in a monopolistically competitive market.                            [2]

                 For outlining that as P > MR, then P cannot equal MC when
                 MR = MC.

          A candidate who draws and refers to long run equilibrium on the diagram provided,
          explaining that it is inconsistent with the position of allocative efficiency, may be fully
          rewarded. Please note that stating the condition is sufficient for [1], even if the
          candidate goes on to provide the incorrect conclusion.

                 For outlining that a current account deficit implies that the supply
                 of the currency exceeds the demand for the currency causing the
                 exchange rate to depreciate
                 OR demand for currency shifts (has decreased) left OR supply of
                 currency shifts (has increased) right, (or, both) either of which
                 causes a depreciation.

                 of its currency.                                                                  [1]

           For the idea that a depreciation makes exports cheaper (and
           imports more expensive) leading to increased net exports and
           thus causing an improvement in the current account balance.
2          The written response is accurate.                                       3–4
           For an explanation that the effect of a depreciation, which makes
           exports cheaper (and imports more expensive) depends on the
           price elasticities of demand for exports and imports; short-term
           elasticities are relatively low and therefore the current account
           balance may worsen; only in the long term, when the
           Marshall-Lerner condition is satisfied, namely that the sum of
           these elasticities must exceed unity, will it improve.

           NB It is not necessary to refer explicitly to the Marshall-Lerner condition or the
           J-curve effect.

               Inflation refers to a (sustained) increase in the Average Price Level – or the
               idea that inflation is an increase in the prices of goods and services                 [1]

               Disinflation refers to a decrease in the rate of increase of the Average Price Level
               OR
               a decrease in the rate of inflation.                                                   [1]

               NB the command term is distinguish, so the precision required in the definition of
               inflation is relaxed.

                        For outlining that weights reflect the proportion of total spending
                        allocated so that increased prices in goods with a larger weight
                        lead to a more significant effect on the inflation rate than goods
                        with a smaller weight
                        OR increased prices are not of equal significance to the typical
                        consumer so weights are used to reflect the relative importance of
                        each good.

                For accurately explaining any two of the following:
                 • deflation induces households to postpone purchases, further
                    decreasing spending which in turn further decreases
                    consumption expenditures and thus AD and leads to a further
                    decrease in real output
                 • real debt of households / firms increases so that consumption
                    expenditures further decrease (or banks accumulate bad
                    loans increasing the likelihood of a bank crisis)
                 • deflation being typically caused by a fall in AD leads to an
                    increase in cyclical unemployment
                 • deflation being typically caused by a fall in AD leads to an
                    increase in cyclical unemployment
                 • the real cost of government debt servicing increases, putting
                    pressure on other areas of government spending
                 • deflation puts downward pressure on firms’ profits because
                    after buying raw materials etc and making the goods, by the
                    time that they sell them prices will have fallen lower to possibly
                    just above the costs of the raw materials. Therefore firms are
                    less likely to expand/invest
                 • higher real interest rates or lower business confidence will
                    discourage firms from borrowing for investment projects
                 • any other reasonable reason explained.

                An accurate explanation of one reason and a limited explanation
                of another reason may be awarded [3].
                Two accurate explanations may be awarded [4].

                reference to the top 20% in Brazil earning more than the top 20%
                in Sweden (or similar) is required. It can be inferred that the US is
                in the middle.

(i)       Explain two reasons for which a highly unequal income distribution may

      1       The written response is limited.                                        1–2
              A limited explanation of one reason may be awarded [1].

              may be awarded [2].
      2       The written response is accurate.                                       3–4
              For accurately explaining any two of the following:
               • a highly unequal distribution of income implies that the poorest
                  are deprived of proper education and health care and thus the
                  growth and development prospects are constrained
               • a highly unequal distribution of income may lead to lower
                  consumption and thus lower AD (because rich have a lower
                  propensity to consume) leading to slower growth and therefore
                  slower development
               • higher income inequality leads to more transfer payments (and
                  possibly lower tax revenue), which restricts public investment
                  in education and infrastructure, causing slower growth and
                  reduced possibilities for development
               • higher income inequality may increase the risk of corruption
                  which increases the costs to business and deters inward
                  investment thus leading to slower growth and development
               • higher income inequality may act as a barrier to those in
                  poverty opening businesses, thus limiting development
                  opportunities for the poor
               • unequal distribution of income may lead to more crime and
                  vandalism. More has to be spent on security, reducing the
                  funds available for development-related spending
                  OR (only one of these points may be rewarded)
                  unequal distribution of income may lead to political instability,
                  deterring investors and thus reducing growth and therefore
                  development
               • any other reasonable explanation.

              Each reason provided should be linked clearly to development.
              However, a candidate who has explained reasons clearly but
              neglected to mention development in either should be penalized for
              this once only – so a well-explained response which does not
              mention development explicitly may be awarded a maximum of [3].
              An accurate explanation of one reason and a limited explanation
              of another reason may be awarded [3].
              Two accurate explanations may be awarded [4].
