           (line 60).                                                                               [4]

                                               Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   Paul’s idea for 3D printing takes Utopia into a secondary sector activity that contrasts with
     its usual tertiary sector activities. In order to produce a sufficient number of souvenirs,
     Utopia would need to buy ten 3D printers at $1000 each. There would be material costs and
     significant operating costs, as well as time and additional labour. Paul has produced a net
     cash flow forecast for the project (Table 1) assuming a five year life for the printers. He likes
     the idea that each souvenir produced could be of a unique design and personalized. Some of
     the materials would be from recycled plastics obtained from waste at the resort. Recycling
     would reduce variable costs and it would be good for the resort’s environment and for
     Utopia’s caring image.

     Liza does not like the idea of 3D printing. She is concerned that the souvenirs may damage
     Utopia’s exclusive brand. She can see difficulties with recruiting someone with both the
     necessary IT skills and the ability to make decisions about which types of souvenirs to
     produce. She is particularly concerned about the impact on Utopia’s current suppliers of
     souvenirs. She thinks that 3D printing is more suited to larger organizations.

     John believes that the 3D printing technology will bring other benefits to his businesses.
     He can imagine decorations and other useful items being produced for the resort and its
     offices.

                          Table 1: Net cash flow for the 3D printing project

                                 Year   Net cash flow (excluding capital
                                                  investment)
                                  1                  $2000
                                  2                  $3000
                                  3                  $4000
                                  4                  $4000
                                  5                  $4000


     (a)   Define the term variable cost.                                                                 [2]

     (b)   With reference to Utopia, explain the differences between secondary sector activities
           and tertiary sector activities.                                                                [4]

     (c)   Using the information above, calculate the payback period and the average rate of
           return (ARR) for the 3D printing project (show all your working).                              [4]

     (d)   Using information from the case study, additional information above and your results
           from part (c), recommend whether Utopia should proceed with the 3D printing project.          [10]
