Answer one question from this section.

1.   Bart Furniture (BF)

     Bart Furniture (BF) is a wholesaler that stocks furniture. In 2015, BF purchased more stock than
     usual in order to take advantage of discounts that several furniture manufacturers were offering.
     However, much of this new stock did not sell.

2.   Geo Dynamics (GD)

     Geo Dynamics (GD) is an engineering company. On 1 January 2016, GD purchased new
     machinery at a cost of $50 000 rather than leasing it. GD’s financial manager researched
     further information:
      The machinery has a useful life of four years.
      Its residual or scrap value will be $8000.
      The engineering industry uses a 40 % depreciation rate per annum.
      Technology in this industry is changing rapidly.

     GD’s financial manager has not yet decided on which depreciation method (such as straight line
     or reducing/declining balance) to use for the new machinery.


     (a)   Describe one disadvantage for GD of leasing.                                               [2]

     (b)   Calculate the value (also known as net book value) of new machinery at 31 December
           2017 using the straight line depreciation method (show all your working).                  [2]

     (c)   Calculate the value (also known as net book value) of new machinery at 31 December
           2017 using the reducing/declining balance method, applying the industry depreciation
           rate of 40 % per annum (show all your working).                                            [4]

     (d)   Explain one advantage for GD of using the straight line balance depreciation method.       [2]

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Health Star (HS)

     Health Star (HS) is a private limited company providing management consultancy services for
     public sector organizations like hospitals. HS is well known for its creativity and for helping
     customers achieve budget targets. HS’s consultants are all shareholders, receive high salaries
     and profit-related pay. HS also gives its consultants freedom and encouragement to be
     intrapreneurs. The consultants’ work performance is appraised on a monthly basis using formative
     appraisal.

     Recently, several pressure groups have protested against the high fees charged by HS. “The high
     fees are outrageous!” said Elaine Hall in a local news report. “Public sector hospitals need to use
     their resources for patient care and not for employing expensive consultants.”

     In response to the pressure groups, HS is considering two options proposed by two senior
     consultants, Dan and Lauren:
      Option 1: Dan has suggested that HS should set up a charity to create educational services
         for children with long-term health problems. The charity will be funded partly through donations
         and partly through HS’s own profits. The charity, Health Star Education (HSE), will finance
         qualified teachers to visit hospitals. HS’s consultants are also expected to volunteer to read to
         sick children.
      Option 2: Lauren has suggested that reducing the high fees should be the priority. She
         suggests that new, untested software could be developed by her project team to significantly
         reduce the costs of treatment for patients. Consequently, HS could charge public sector
         hospitals a lower fee.


     (a)   Describe one possible objective of a public health organization.                             [2]

     (b)   Explain two characteristics of an intrapreneur at HS.                                        [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for HS of using formative appraisal.              [4]

     (d)   Recommend which of Option 1 and Option 2 HS should implement.                               [10]

4.   Secco Vineyards (SV)

     Secco Vineyards (SV ) is a family-owned business producing wine in Sonoma, California.
     In 1947, SV opened using cost-plus (mark-up) pricing. For SV ’s customers, the wines were
     medium priced and available in local grocery stores.

     In 1977, Joe Secco, grandson of the founder, created a new strategy. He re-branded SV ’s wine for
     a niche premium market.
      SV began to sell directly to customers at its winery instead of in local grocery stores.
      SV stopped using cost-plus (mark-up) pricing and began charging much higher prices.
      Regular wine tastings and promotional events were held at its winery. At these events, wine
        experts would promote SV ’s wines by creating an elegant experience based on a luxurious
        culture of wine consumption. SV ’s physical evidence in its marketing mix became much more
        important.

     However, SV has recently faced intense competition and sales have fallen. Local wine producers
     and overseas competitors have entered the market with similar market positioning. In order to
     maintain its brand image, SV has not changed its pricing strategies.

     SV conducted secondary market research about other possible markets in the US for its premium
     wines. The research suggested that other possible markets for high-quality wines, such as those
     of SV, exist. As a result, SV is considering two new options to increase sales in addition to its
     current distribution channel:
      Option 1: open a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce store
      Option 2: sell SV wines to wholesalers serving the whole of the US market for premium wines.


     (a)   Describe one characteristic of a niche market.                                            [2]

     (b)   With reference to SV, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using
           secondary market research.                                                                [4]

     (c)   Given the intense competition, explain two pricing strategies SV might consider.          [4]

     (d)   Recommend which of Option 1 and Option 2 SV should consider in order to increase
           sales.                                                                                  [10]

5.   Gen Y Limited

     Gen Y Limited is an internet start-up business owned by Zack Johnson. Zack owns 80 % of
     the shares and venture capitalists own the other 20 %. Gen Y has specialist programmers and
     coders who create innovative market research data reports for clients. These data reports have
     revolutionized Gen Y ’s clients’ ability to understand and respond to customers in their markets.

     To retain the best programmers, employees are given cognitive training and are empowered to
     make decisions and take risks. They are also regularly praised for the impact that their reports
     are having on their clients’ decision making. One day a week, employees can work on their own
     “dream, but risky, projects”. Intrapreneurship is strongly encouraged at Gen Y. However, Gen Y
     lacks the capital to develop some of these projects into future revenue streams.

     Virtually all of Gen Y ’s costs are fixed – salaries. As of 2017, Gen Y has not yet generated a profit.
     Without more revenue they will have to reduce the number of programmers. Petra, a new investor,
     is being considered to provide fresh capital to invest in Gen Y. Ownership of Gen Y will change to:

     Zack                    40 %
     Venture capitalists     20 %
     Petra                   40 %

     Petra believes in intrapreneurship but is concerned that “dream” projects are not generating profits.
     She has said that if she is going to invest in Gen Y two conditions must be met:
      Management at Gen Y will change to an autocratic leadership style.
      Programmers will be expected to meet sales targets.

     As a result, programmers will have no autonomy.


     (a)   Outline two features of an autocratic leadership style.                                       [2]

     (b)   Apply Daniel Pink’s motivation theory to the programmers at Gen Y.                            [6]

     (c)   Explain one reason, other than increased sales revenue, why it is important that
           Gen Y generates new revenue streams.                                                          [2]

     (d)   Discuss whether Zack should sell Petra half of his shares with her conditions.               [10]
