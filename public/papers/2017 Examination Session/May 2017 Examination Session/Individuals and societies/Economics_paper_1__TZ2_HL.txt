Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain how an increase in the costs of factors of production would affect the market
           price and output of a good.                                                              [10]

     (b)   Discuss the consequences for different stakeholders in the economy of the government
           providing subsidies on goods, such as renewable energy.                                  [15]


2.   (a)   Explain why a loss-making firm in perfect competition would shut down in the long run.   [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that perfect competition is a more desirable market structure than
           monopoly.                                                                                [15]

                                              Section B

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain how equilibrium interest rates are determined in an economy.                      [10]

     (b)   Discuss whether an increase in interest rates is the most effective way of reducing the
           rate of inflation in an economy.                                                          [15]


4.   (a)   Explain the cause of cyclical (demand-deficient) unemployment.                            [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that the most significant consequence of unemployment is the loss of
           tax revenue for the government.                                                           [15]
