Answer one question from this section.

1.   Sotatsu Electronics (SE)

     Sotatsu Electronics (SE) manufactures electronic products and is famous for its innovative
     televisions. In late 2015, SE introduced a new high-definition television with twice the quality of
     the best-selling television of its chief competitor. Determining that it would be two years before its
     competitors could have a similar product, SE adopted a price skimming strategy.

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Dales

     Dales is a public limited hotel chain operating in a highly competitive tourism market. Dales is
     positioned as a high-price and high-quality chain. The majority of its staff are on permanent
     contracts, but wage rates at Dales are below the average for the hotel industry. Consequently,
     staff turnover is high. Recruitment is difficult due to the number of hotels in the areas where Dales
     hotels are located and the wages paid.

     In 2010, in order to remain competitive, Dales outsourced the cleaning of hotel rooms to Wire.
     Outsourcing reduced the cost of cleaning rooms for Dales from 5 % of total revenue per room to
     2 %. Net profit after tax and interest increased and share prices rose by 10 %.

     Initially, Wire paid cleaners at Dales a low wage of:
      $6 per hour for 8 hours, 5 days per week.
      Cleaners cleaned, on average, 13 rooms per day.

     In 2016, Wire introduced a piece rate system:
      $2 is paid per room cleaned.
      Cleaners have a target of 20 rooms per day, 5 days per week.

     In recent years, newspaper reports highlighting poor pay and working conditions have damaged
     Dales’s brand image. Recent customer feedback has also highlighted concerns about food quality,
     room cleanliness and poor customer service at Dales hotels. Room bookings fell during the same
     period. Profits in 2016 decreased from $24 m to $4 m.

     The current contract with Wire is up for renewal. Dales is considering insourcing.


     (a)   Outline two common steps taken by a business in recruitment.                                 [2]

     (b)   (i)     Explain two disadvantages for Wire of introducing a piece rate system of wages
                   for its cleaning staff.                                                              [4]

		         (ii)    Calculate the financial impact on cleaners employed by Wire from the introduction
                   of the piece rate system in 2016 (show all your working).                            [2]

		         (iii)   Calculate the change in cleaning costs per room from the introduction of the
                   piece rate system used by Wire.                                                      [2]

     (c)   Recommend if Dales should stop outsourcing the cleaning of hotel rooms.                     [10]

4.   Secco Vineyards (SV)

     Secco Vineyards (SV ) is a family-owned business producing wine in Sonoma, California.
     In 1947, SV opened using cost-plus (mark-up) pricing. For SV ’s customers, the wines were
     medium priced and available in local grocery stores.

     In 1977, Joe Secco, grandson of the founder, created a new strategy. He re-branded SV ’s wine for
     a niche premium market.
      SV began to sell directly to customers at its winery instead of in local grocery stores.
      SV stopped using cost-plus (mark-up) pricing and began to sells its wines at much higher prices
        than before.
      Regular wine tastings and promotional events were held at its winery. At these events, wine
        experts would promote SV ’s wines by creating an elegant experience based on a luxurious
        culture of wine consumption: stylish wine glasses, classical music and food that complements
        the wine.

     However, SV has recently faced intense competition and sales have fallen. Local wine producers
     and overseas competitors have entered the market with similar market positioning. In order to
     maintain its brand image, SV has not changed its pricing strategies.

     SV conducted secondary market research about other possible markets in the US for its premium
     wines. The research suggested that other possible markets for high-quality wines, such as those
     of SV, exist. As a result, SV is considering two options to increase sales in addition to its current
     distribution channel:
      Option 1: open a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce store
      Option 2: sell SV wines to wholesalers serving the whole of the US market for premium wines.


     (a)   Describe one characteristic of a niche market.                                                [2]

     (b)   With reference to SV, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using
           secondary market research.                                                                    [4]

     (c)   Given the intense competition, explain two pricing strategies SV might consider.              [4]

     (d)   Recommend which of Option 1 and Option 2 SV should consider in order to increase
           sales.                                                                                      [10]

5.   Gen Y Limited

     Gen Y Limited is an internet start-up business owned by Zack Johnson. Zack owns 80 % of
     the shares and venture capitalists own the other 20 %. Gen Y has specialist programmers and
     coders who create innovative market research data reports for clients. These data reports have
     revolutionized Gen Y ’s clients’ ability to understand and respond to customers in their markets.

     To retain the best programmers, employees are given cognitive training and are empowered to
     make decisions and take risks. They are also regularly praised for the impact that their reports
     are having on their clients’ decision making. One day a week, employees can work on their own
     “dream, but risky, projects”. Intrapreneurship is strongly encouraged at Gen Y. However, Gen Y
     lacks the capital to develop some of these projects into future revenue streams.

     Virtually all of Gen Y ’s costs are fixed – salaries. As of 2017, Gen Y has not yet generated a profit.
     Without more revenue they will have to reduce the number of programmers. Petra, a new investor,
     is being considered to provide fresh capital to invest in Gen Y. Ownership of Gen Y will change to:

     Zack                    40 %
     Venture capitalists     20 %
     Petra                   40 %

     Petra believes in intrapreneurship but is concerned that “dream” projects are not generating profits.
     She has said that if she is going to invest in Gen Y two conditions must be met:
      Management at Gen Y will change to an autocratic leadership style.
      Programmers will be expected to meet sales targets.

     As a result, programmers will have no autonomy.


     (a)   Outline two features of an autocratic leadership style.                                       [2]

     (b)   Apply Daniel Pink’s motivation theory to the programmers at Gen Y.                            [6]

     (c)   Explain one reason, other than increased sales revenue, why it is important that
           Gen Y generates new revenue streams.                                                          [2]

     (d)   Discuss whether Zack should sell Petra half of his shares with her conditions.               [10]
