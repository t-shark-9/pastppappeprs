      Map A shows part of the urban area of Nashville, US.  The scale of the map is 1:24 000 and the
      contour interval is 3 metres.

      Map B shows the distribution of obesity, a form of malnutrition, for different areas of Nashville.

      (a)   (i)    Outline what is meant by the term “malnutrition”.                                         [2]

		          (ii)   State the obesity range of values for area X and area Z on map B.                         [2]

      (b)   Using evidence from map A, suggest two reasons why the obesity rate in area X is
            different from that in area Z.                                                                 [3+3]

      (c)   Evaluate the success of management strategies applied in any country or region for
            one vector-borne, water-borne or sexually transmitted disease.                                  [10]

      The map shows the distribution of the neighbourhoods in an African city with low incomes and high
      population density.

      (a)   (i)   With reference to the map, describe the distribution of neighbourhoods with
                  low incomes and high population density.                                           [3]

		(ii)            Outline three possible economic reasons for the location of neighbourhoods
                  with low incomes and high population density in the urban area shown on
                  the map.                                                                           [3]

      (b)   Analyse the contribution of natural change to population density patterns in
            urban areas.                                                                             [4]
