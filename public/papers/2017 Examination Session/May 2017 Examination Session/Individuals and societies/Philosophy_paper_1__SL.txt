Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [25 marks].

Core theme: Being human

1.   Read the following passage and develop your response as indicated below.

     “Our sense of the full range of human nature, […] has been steadily reduced. No matter how
     rewarding it might be, anything wild and dangerous gets pulled – though as we shall see, some of
     the weeds growing in us have roots reaching deep into our shared past. Pull them if you want, but
     they will just keep coming back again and again.”

     With explicit reference to the stimulus and your own knowledge, discuss a philosophical issue
