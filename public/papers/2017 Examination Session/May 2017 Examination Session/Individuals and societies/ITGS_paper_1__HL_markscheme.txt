Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation - Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis - Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation - My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                               Section A
1.   Airport luggage control

     Note to examiners.
     • All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
     • Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   The barcode allows the airport's luggage control system to access a database
           containing information about each piece of luggage.

           (i)    Identify two pieces of information about the luggage that may be obtained
                  from this database.                                                               [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • destination
                  • passenger name/surname
                  • weight of the bag
                  • route of the complete journey (eg point of departure / transfers)
                  • flight information (flight number, airline).

                  NB: Do not accept simply “journey” – sufficient detail must be given.

                  Award [1] for identifying each piece of information about the luggage that
                  may be obtained from this database up to maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Identify the steps taken by the luggage control system to decide which conveyor
                  belt to choose when a bag reaches a junction between two conveyor
                  belts.                                                                            [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • barcode reader reads barcode of bag arriving junction
                  • system looks for code/finds code in the database
                  • system retrieves the flight number (accept destination of the flight) that
                    the bag needs to be delivered to from the record associated with that
                    code
                  • system also retrieves data identifying which conveyor has been
                    assigned to deliver bags for that flight number
                  • if the new conveyor has been assigned to the same flight number as the
                    bag, the bag is pushed onto the new conveyor
                  • if not then the bag continues on the original conveyor.

                  NB: Responses must make reference to the IT system(s) involved.

                  Award [1] for identifying each of the steps taken by the system to decide if
                  a bag is pushed to a different conveyor or not when arriving at a junction up
                  to maximum of [4].

(b)   Analyse the decision by some airports to attach radio frequency identification (RFID)
      tags to luggage when it is checked in by the passenger, instead of barcode paper
      printed tags.                                                                           [6]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of barcodes on printed tags
      • tags have information that is visible and readable by people
      • workers may re-route luggage if needed as information is readable
      • printing may be cheaper than RFID tags.

      Disadvantages of barcodes on printed tags
      • barcodes need to be in the line of sight with the barcode reading device
      • paper tags may get dirty or broken
      • papers with barcodes may not deliver the information if they are damaged
         (and paper tags are easily damaged)
      • barcode tags more labour intensive – need to be printed and physically
         attached by airport staff.

      Advantages of RFID tags
      • can be read by RFID reader from a greater distance/no need to have tag in
        line with reader
      • RFID tags can have more information that a set of numbers in a barcode
      • can be reused (if returned – or by frequent flyers)
      • are read at a faster rate than barcodes
      • may not get damaged with handling as easy as paper tags
      • RFID are read/write devices – information may be added along the way
      • RFID tags more secure – can be encrypted
      • more than one tag can respond at the same time – (so bags hidden under
        other bags would still be detected etc).

      Disadvantages of RFID tags
      • more expensive
      • if system fails then there may not be information on tag readable by a person/
         possible delays in baggage processing
      • possible that they are read by unauthorized users
      • used tags are more difficult to destroy/deactivate than paper barcodes/
         discarded tags pose a potential privacy issue for the traveller.

      [0]: No knowledge or understanding of ITGS issues and concepts. No use of
      appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the use of barcodes / RFID tags and uses little or no
      appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4]: A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the use of barcodes / RFID tags. Some
      relevant examples from the scenario are used within the response. There is
      some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the response.

      [5–6]: A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates
      thorough knowledge and understanding of the use of barcodes / RFID tags.
      Relevant examples from the scenario are used throughout the response. There
      is appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the response.

(c)   Airlines have databases that contain data about passengers when tickets are booked.
      This data includes travel dates, itineraries, contact details, passport details and
      passengers' home addresses. When passengers purchase a ticket online from an
      airline company, they have to accept the airline's terms and conditions by clicking
      "Agree" (see Figure 2).




      Within these terms and conditions, it states that the airline may receive a request
      to share this data with the government of the country to which the passenger is flying.

      Discuss whether airlines should share the passenger's data with the government of the
      country to which they are flying.                                                         [8]

      Answers may include:
      • airlines or passengers may see sharing this information as unethical or a
        breach of privacy which may raise wider issues and affect their business or
        business model
      • airlines may feel that if passengers are aware that the airline sharing their data
        they may decide not to use the airline and opt for one that does not have data
        sharing agreements
      • sharing passenger data might help protect countries from terrorist attacks or
        other criminal activities (eg passengers may be on a “watch-list” in the
        destination country)
      • sharing passenger data may allow governments to respond more effectively if
        the passenger needs to be traced/contacted urgently during their stay in the
        country
      • governments can track and analyze tourism data for planning workforce,
        infrastructure etc
      • will the additional time and effort the airline spends on highlighting this data
        sharing agreement be cost effective? In other words, do passengers need to
        know, or are passengers likely to care?
      • airlines may feel that passengers may not be concerned about their data being
        shared, or they may just accept that this will happen as it is “out there”,
        regardless of whether they agree with it or not
      • if airlines group together they could form associations that can set policies
        about what data should be shared/should not be shared with governments
        which may make passengers feel more confident about the confidentiality of
        their data
      • governments may require that airlines make this data sharing available and
        part of the ticket purchasing process, so the decision may be effectively made
        for the airline.

(b)   Medical students in Peru must spend six months training in rural areas during
      their medical studies. Apurimac Health Centre has been selected by the medical
      school in Cusco as a place to send students for training every year.

      Analyse the impact on the medical student of spending six months training in a health
      centre with limited Internet access.                                                    [6]

      Answers may include:
      • students will need to ask a local doctor or rely on their knowledge from school/
        will not be able to research on the Internet when in doubt/will not be able to
        collaborate with online with experts
      • may feel frustrated and not do the job properly
      • medical students may want to take their own IT devices (phones with internet
        access plans, computers, tablets), which could lead to different issues such as
        those linked to security, patient’s data privacy and the use of different
        platforms
      • will not have facilities such as teleconferencing with experts (eg for guidance
        during a difficult medical procedure)
      • will not have access to fast results (eg if a patient sees a specialist in Cusco
        results would need to be posted back to Apurimac)
      • limited access might result in less distractions (eg social media) and greater
        focus on work
      • may help students become more able to cope with similar situations met later
        on in their careers.

(c)   Juan has a limited budget and has two options:
      • install a network and pay for an Internet connection, or
      • spend the money on training the doctors to use the IT system, acquiring modern
        software and installing diagnostic tools on the standalone computers.
      Evaluate these two options.                                                         [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of installing a network and internet connection
      • computers in the network can share resources (hard disk for files, printers)
      • doctors with an internet connection can do research when needed
      • doctors can consult other doctors not in the area and share images/share test
        results
      • software can be installed on the network and shared (if license allows it)
      • doctors will have access to online training in IT and in their professional
        capacity
      • doctors can backup data to the cloud to guard against data loss if computers
        are damaged/stolen
      • internet access may include WiFi (allowing doctors to use personal devices/
        expand the network beyond the six desktop computers).

      Disadvantages of installing a network and internet connection
      • installing a network might require bringing an IT expert to install it
      • appoint a network administrator
      • if the network is down lack of skills/funds may mean patient records are
         inaccessible
      • connection to the internet may increase the risk of malware infecting
         computers/risk of unauthorised access. Centre may need to install and
         maintain anti-virus software/firewall, etc.

      Advantages of standalone computers: IT training for doctors, acquiring
      modern software, installing diagnostic tools
      • patients may be treated more effectively with doctors receiving constant IT
        training
      • modern resources may help doctors do their job better and the centre’s
        patients will benefit from these improvements directly
      • IT training will improve the use of computers – better service to patients
        (record keeping, follow ups)
      • less skills required to manage standalones
      • if one computer is down it will not impact the others/other computers can still
        be used.

      Disadvantages of standalone computers: IT training for doctors, acquiring
      modern software, installing diagnostic tools
      • software needs to be installed in every computer (licencing) or only in some
         and this might be a difficulty
      • all the disadvantages of lack of collaboration with experts in other
         places/online resources
      • may need to employ trained staff to maintain/configure the stand-alone
         computers.
      • data held on computers may become unreliable (eg data updated on one
         computer may not be updated on another).

     (a)   (i)    Identify two ways of preventing parents from making mistakes when
                  entering data on the online form.                                                 [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • drop down list
                  • data validation rules
                  • range check
                  • data type check
                  • presence check
                  • character check/format check
                  • double-entry of data (data verification)
                  • check-box added to the data entry form for the parent to confirm that all
                    the data entered is correct.

                  Award [1] for identifying each way parents can be prevented from making
                  mistakes when entering data on the form up to maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Identify two characteristics of a relational database.                            [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • two or more tables in the database are linked/joined using key fields
                  • a defined relationship between at least two tables within the database
                  • a relational database prevents redundancy as fields may be coded and
                    related to a table that has the complete information
                  • it is faster to enter information into a relational database as codes may
                    be used
                  • less storage space is used and long fields (for descriptions) may be
                    replaced by codes from a related table
                  • less mistakes are made when entering data as entering a code is shorter
                    than a complete description (less room for mistakes)
                  • data independence.

                  Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of a relational database up to
                  maximum of [2].

      (iii)   The school wants to consult a lawyer about the documentation that would be
              needed to send students to France during the summer holidays. They would
              like to search the database to find a parent who is a lawyer and has French as
              their mother-tongue (first language).

              Outline the query that could be used to search for this information.               [2]

              Answers may include:
              • (List all parents) WHERE mother-tongue =”French” and
                profession=”lawyer”.

              NB: The WHERE and AND conditions do not need to be capitalized.

(b)   The developers of ColegiumWise may accept requests from clients such as schools for
      additions or changes to the system. The developers send out system upgrades and
      updated user manuals on a regular basis with the changes that have been requested
      by the schools and other clients.

      Explain three different ways the upgraded version of ColegiumWise could be tested
      before it is sent to the schools and other clients.                                        [6]

      Answers may include:
      • MIS is tested by the development team (in-house or alpha testing – system). Accept
        responses that detail specific tests, eg regression testing, unit testing, testing the
        correct operation of validation rules, etc
      • MIS is sent to a small number of schools and they are asked to try the new options
        (pilot/prototype, a part of agile development)
      • a “test version” or “beta release” version of the MIS is made available that users
        may try and send comments on what they find (beta testing).

      NB: Candidates may detail the testing of more than one validation rule. Award
      marks for each different valid test explained.

(c)   ColegiumWise has several key functions that cannot be changed. The contract with
      the developers of ColegiumWise is due to expire in 2018 and the administrators at
      WHS have two options:
      • continue with ColegiumWise, knowing that it will not have the specific functions
         required by the school
      • not renew the contract and develop their own school management information
         system (MIS) for the school.

      Evaluate these options.                                                                   [8]

      Answers may include:

      Renew the contract
      • the ColegiumWise system is ready and can be used immediately as they have
        been doing
      • users are already familiar with the system and won’t require any retraining
      • support provided by the ColegiumWise provider
      • changes requested by other schools (clients) may be useful to the school
        (client) as well
      • school may have to pay a costly licence while the system is being used
      • school may need to adapt some features they wish to include to what is
        offered by the software
      • some changes requested may take too long to be implemented
      • there will be further need for additional features over time so it is likely that the
        current MIS will become increasingly limited in the future
      • the school may have to include data in the database which they don’t need but
        the system requires (which wastes their time).

      Create their own
      • the system will be created to cover the school’s exact needs (if possible)
      • the system may be adapted to changes that are introduced over time
      • a team will have to be appointed for the development of the system
      • the in-house system may take a long time to be created
      • the school (IT team) has the responsibility of the functionality of the system
      • the school (IT team) has the responsibility for the security of the stored data
      • new staff may need to be hired as current staff may not have sufficient
        expertise to develop and support the system
      • there may be additional requirements for hardware to run the new system
      • may involve more costs for development and training
      • migrating data from the existing (ColegiumWise) system to the new system
        may cause issues (eg data loss, incompatible formats, data types, etc).

                   Answers may include:
                   • uses neural networks or decision trees to find patterns in sets of training
                     data
                   • can use pattern recognition
                   • requires large quantities of data
                   • uses an iterative process ie looks at one set of data, extracts
                     characteristics, then another set and another etc
                   • requires significant computer power
                   • computer program that can teach itself to grow and change when

           (iii)   Riot Games collected examples of behaviour that players had reported as
                   abusive. A committee decided which examples were actually abusive.

                   Outline one limitation of collecting data in this way.                            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • some players who had experienced abuse may not have complained, so
                     the sample may not represent a full range of player experience
                   • time consuming because all complaints need to be read and judged.

(b)   The new system has been implemented in phases, starting with the instant
      feedback system.

      (i)     Explain one reason why Riot Games decided to use a phased
              changeover when introducing the new system to the game.                       [2]

              Answers may include:
              • they can test each phase sequentially so they can refine it before
                introducing the next phase
              • the players have time to adjust to the new system step by step
              • change, even positive change, is often rejected, this process reduces
                potential dissatisfaction of the players with new ideas
              • Riot Games’ staff can be trained gradually.

      Award [1] for identifying a reason why Riot Games decided to use a phased
      changeover when introducing the new system to the game and [1] for a
      development of the impact identified up to a maximum of [2].

      (ii)    Riot Games has been happy to share both its data and best practices for
              controlling abusive behaviour with the wider gaming industry.

              Explain one benefit of this decision.                                         [2]

              Answers may include:
              • sharing best practices will help other game companies control abusive
                behavior in their games
              • more people will work with the data and/or implement the practices.
                This opens up the possibility of new ideas being generated that will
                improve the software for everyone
              • researchers, for example psychologists who study gamers, will have
                access to more data. More data may enable them to discover new
                patterns and better understanding of the gamers who act in an abusive
                manner.

              Award [1] for identifying a reason why Riot Games has been very open
              about sharing their data and their best practices for controlling abusive
              behaviour with the wider gaming industry and [1] for a development of the
              reason identified up to a maximum of [2].

      (iii)   Explain one reason why Riot Games chose to ask the end-users to decide
              what should be considered as abusive behavior.                                [2]

              Answers may include:
              • allowed them to gather a very large quantity of data. More data provides
                a foundation for better analysis (increases the reliability of the data)
              • end users are directly affected, so their judgments as to what is
                offensive are critical
              • involving end users gives them the sense that their ideas are being

              Award [1] for identifying a reason why Riot Games chose to ask the end
              users to decide what would be considered as abusive behaviour and [1] for
              a development of the impact identified up to a maximum of [2].

(c)   While Riot Games is using artificial intelligence algorithms to improve game
      behaviour, similar algorithms could be used to evaluate the performance of
      employees, such as speed of service, body language, and so on. For example,
      the interactions between employees and customers in a coffee shop could be
      recorded and analysed to evaluate employee behaviour.

      Discuss the impact on the employees of the coffee shop of their managers using
      artificial intelligence algorithms to evaluate their performance.                      [8]

      Answers may include:
      • both good employees and poor employees could be identified – impacts could
        include better training of employees, firing of employees whose behavior does not
        improve, recognition or pay raise for good employees
      • inefficient employee work patterns could be identified, ie poor interaction of
        employees doing various jobs, poor communication skills – impact could be analysis
        and subsequent changes in employee work patterns (must address impact of
        changing patterns on employees)
      • improved employee efficiency could lead to customers experiencing better service
        which may increase tips for employees
      • relationships between employees and managers could either improve or degenerate
        depending on how this system is used (development must focus on the impact on
        the employee, not the manager)
      • employees can get feedback on their performance – impact is that they can improve
        based on the feedback
      • some employees may feel uncomfortable or stressed by being under surveillance –
        may impact their work performance, cause employee burnout, or lower morale.

       comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify the steps used by the facial recognition software to control access
                  to the hotel rooms.                                                              [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • the image of the guest is captured, ie with a camera
                  • the image is stored in a database
                  • the room number of the guest is added to the database
                  • the software measures key features of the face (distance between the
                    eyes, width of the nose, etc)
                  • this information is stored in the database
                  • the software accesses the room details of the guest
                  • when the guest wants to enter the room, the software matches the

(b)   Guests are understandably concerned about what happens when something
      goes wrong. One day at the hotel Ms Kuragawa, the human manager, received
      the following incident report (a list of problems in the hotel) when she began her work
      shift:
      • a room service robot has lost power on its way back from a delivery
      • two guests have discovered that their luggage was taken to the wrong room
      • the dinosaur robot that checks people in began repeating itself and had to be
         shut down, so there are now only two clerks to check people in
      • the Tulip robot in room 104 has stopped working.

      Incidents are given priority ratings of low, normal, high or very high. Ms Kuragawa
      must give a priority rating to each incident.

      Explain three criteria that she can use to determine the priority of these
      incidents.                                                                                [6]

      Answers may include:
      • criterion: does the incident affect the core business?
      • and reason why the incident affects the core business

      • criterion: does the incident affect more than n users?
      • and reason why the number of users makes the incident a priority

      • criterion: does the incident affect the image/reputation of the business (such as
        hotel rating/cost)?
      • and reason why the image/reputation of the business may be affected

      • criterion: the occurrence of the incident is intermittent
      • and reason why an intermittent problem may be more serious than one that
        happens, but does not seem to resolve itself/not possible to predict what staff
        resources are needed to resolve the incident

      • criterion: the time required to complete the repair
      • and reason why the particular incident needs a speedy resolution (or not)

      • criterion: what is the impact on guests if the problem is not resolved
      • and reason whether the incident is potentially a priority to resolve

      • criterion: if a human is harmed
      • and reason: any harm to a human being will negatively affect the reputation of the
        hotel/any harm to a human being is a serious issue.

      Award [1] for each criterion identified and [1] for the explanation of that criterion
      up to a maximum of [2].

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

      Award a maximum of [6] for the answer.

(c)   Several other hotels are experimenting with robots that can check guests in,
      deliver room service and store bags.

      Discuss the impact of using robots instead of human beings to provide services
      to guests in hotels.                                                                    [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages
      • robots can make repetitive tasks more efficient
      • robots can be better at remembering guest preferences
      • robots that deliver room service don’t need to be tipped
      • will save costs of hiring more staff
      • tech savvy visitors will enjoy this type of service
      • can free hotel staff to take care of more complex tasks
      • younger customers may prefer robots
      • can eliminate long lines as people check in
      • robots are less intrusive than humans when delivering room service
      • fewer health and safety issues, eg lifting heavy loads, cleaning up after guests
      • robot responses may be limited so they can’t answer complex questions/unusual
        requests for example when guests check in
      • robots have greater memory than humans so they can deliver some services more
        efficiently and accurately than humans, ie checking in/out, checking bags, etc
      • robots can be programmed to speak multiple languages (as in the Hen-nat Hotel).

      Disadvantages
      • robots cannot provide personalized services such as special food orders
      • they are unlikely to be used in high-end hotels where people expect
         customized service
      • robots can malfunction or not perform the required action
      • robots need maintenance. The hotel will have to provide tech support itself or
         purchase it from the robot’s manufacturer
      • hotels will need to have staff to help the guests with the robots
      • guests, particularly older guests, may prefer “the human touch”, ie uncomfortable
         with robots
      • there may be reliability issues for example a robot breaks down whilst delivering
         room service
      • the robot may not speak or understand the customer's language. Discussion might
         include the robot’s inability to communicate as a human would to compensate for
         this issue, ie it won’t use gestures
      • robots will take human jobs. Discussions should include description/analysis of the
         impact on society.

                   Answers may include:
                   • a step by step process for solving a problem or performing an operation
                   • each step must be precise, ie unambiguous
                   • can be a computer program, a recipe, etc
                   • can be written in both natural language and programming language
                   • algorithms have a finite number of steps.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristics of an algorithm up to
                   maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Identify two situations in addition to roads in cities where the self-driving trucks
                   may not be able to operate safely without a human driver.                              [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • anything that’s unexpected or random – this answer requires an
                     example such as flat tire, shift in load, emergency vehicle appears
                   • inclement weather

(b)   (i)    Explain one reason why the software that controls these trucks needs to
             use pattern recognition.                                                          [2]

             Answers may include:
             • to recognize road signs/traffic lights to know what action to take
             • to recognize people to avoid hitting them
             • to recognize markings on road in order to stay within its lane.

             trucks needs to use pattern recognition and [1] for a development of the
             impact identified up to a maximum of [2].

      (ii)   Mr Mahoney has asked the project management team to undertake a feasibility
             study.

             Explain why undertaking a feasibility study will help Mr Mahoney decide whether
             to go ahead with the purchase.                                                    [4]

             Answers may include:

               analysis
             • determines if the problems that his current vehicles have would be
               remedied by the new trucks. How urgent are these problems? Is there
               another solution?
             • explores the effect on the drivers ie will they be comfortable driving
               these trucks. Will they resist change? How will their working
               environment change? Will the effects on drivers be positive or negative
               for the company?
             • how soon could the change to these trucks occur? What would be the
               best time to make such a changeover?
             • to determine any training requirements for drivers who work in these
               new trucks. How much will training cost? How will it be done? How much
               time will be needed?

(c)   To what extent would changing his 75 trucks to self-driving trucks benefit
      Mr Mahoney’s company?                                                                [8]

      Answers may include:

      Benefits
      • safety – avoids the problem of driver error because drivers are sleepy, 90 % of
        truck accident are due to driver error
      • frees the driver from the monotonous part of truck driving
      • more fuel efficient
      • reduces pollution
      • currently there is a shortage of truck drivers in the US and Europe and it will
        get worse. This addresses that problem
      • there will still be drivers in the trucks
      • a faster trip - a truck can drive 24/7 (however if there is an accompanying
        driver he will need some stops).

      Disadvantages
      • cost of replacing the trucks may be prohibitive
      • legal problems may arise if there’s an accident involving the trucks
      • drivers might become too dependent on the system, so they don’t react quickly
         enough when human intervention is needed
      • drivers might use the system in situations where it shouldn’t be used. Could be
         dangerous
      • insurance companies might be reluctant to insure this new technology
      • technical support will be needed to keep the trucks running properly. This could
         be costly
      • additional costs due to training of drivers.

                   Answers may include:
                   • testing of new software done toward the end of the development process
                   • main goal is to refine the quality of the product by fixing bugs/problems
                     before they affect the final product
                   • generally done “in house” ie not by users who don’t work for the
                     company
                   • usually done by a group that is not part of the design team
                   • determines if the software is ready for beta testing.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristics of alpha testing up to
                   maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of beta testing.                                       [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • last test of new hardware or software prior to release
                   • main goal is to refine the product by fixing bugs/problems not found in
                     alpha testing
                   • done by external stakeholders/users rather than “in house”
                   • carried out in a real environment/real world testing
                   • performed after alpha testing.

                   Award [1] for identifying each characteristics of beta testing up to maximum
                   of [2].

           (iii)   Identify two characteristics of artificial intelligence.                            [2]

                   Answers may include:

(b)   The developers used the agile project development methodology rather than the
      waterfall project development methodology to develop PAWS.

      Explain why the developers have decided to use an agile project development
      methodology.                                                                           [6]

      Advantages of agile:
      • more flexible than waterfall – programmer can make changes as it is
        developed/ project priorities are re-evaluated on a continuing basis
      • may lead to cost savings as potential errors in PAWS may be identified and
        eliminated at an early stage of development
      • beneficial for small teams with rapidly changing requirements as poaching
        patterns, research into poaching patterns or poaching legislation in the
        countries may change / vary
      • iterative in nature so can respond to challenges that occur during development
        so is able to incorporate new features/ideas as PAWS develops
      • training is “just-in-time” and on-going
      • may lead to faster development compared with waterfall method
      • may allow the development team to return to an earlier stage such as creating
        a second prototype if deemed necessary.

(c)   In the future the use of PAWS will be extended to cover all of sub-Saharan
      Africa, and will be run from a control centre that communicates where it thinks
      poachers might be active to the rangers who are patrolling these areas.

      To what extent can the implementation of PAWS assist in reducing the
      poaching of African elephants?                                                      [8]

      Answers may include:
      • random patrols can help catch more poachers
      • predicting poacher’s future actions will make them more vulnerable to capture
      • as PAWS develops new insights, new approaches to dealing with poachers
        may emerge
      • PAWS may lead to greater efficiencies in the search for poachers and
        therefore a reduction in poaching
      • the involvement of countries such as the USA may raise the profile of elephant
        poaching and governments and NGOs may divert additional funds to reducing
        poaching so PAWS may be a catalyst for change
      • the effectiveness of PAWS will be based on a number of external factors that
        are outside the control of the AI software such as the competence of the
        rangers
      • the AI software may be constantly playing “catch-up” with the poachers so it is
        going to be one step behind the poachers
      • the security measures used by PAWS may be vulnerable to hackers who may
        be able to sell this information on to the poachers rendering PAWS ineffectual,
        may lead to the ambushing of rangers
      • the movements of the elephants may be less predictable than the computer
        models that attempt to model it so PAWS may have limited effectiveness
      • there may not be enough data available from this wider area for patterns of
        elephant movement to be determined with any degree of confidence
      • the use of PAWS across many geographical boundaries may make it become
        a generic software rather than be flexible enough to address the needs of
        individual countries
      • the use of PAWS across many geographical boundaries may increase the
        cost of the software as it will have to be adapted to a wider area
      • rangers will need to be trained in the use of PAWS thus increasing the costs of
        the program
      • the software may lead to administrators trusting the algorithms in the software
        rather than the judgement of the rangers.
