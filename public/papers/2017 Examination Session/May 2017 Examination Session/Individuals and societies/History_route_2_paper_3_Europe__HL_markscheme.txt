Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the candidates given and award credit wherever it
is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Candidates that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks    Level descriptor
 13–15    • Candidates are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and
             implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively organized.

             structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
          • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and there is a
             clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are
             used to support the analysis/evaluation.
          • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of different
             perspectives.
          • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and the
             response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9     • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are
             only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
          • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their historical
             context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.
          • The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this
             is not sustained.

Section 1        Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   “The Norman invasion in 1066 had little impact on the people of England.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the suggestion that the people of
     England were little affected by the Norman invasion in 1066. Candidates may fully agree, partially
     agree or disagree with the statement. They may briefly contextualize the situation in England on
     the eve of the Norman invasion and compare it to the situation in the decades following the
     invasion. Alternatively, candidates may identify a range of social and/or geographical factors and
     discuss the impact in terms of these. For example, they may suggest that elites were affected to a
     far greater extent than the peasantry, for whom the change may have been as simple as the
     swapping of one landowner for another. Whichever method is used, candidates must focus on the
     impact of the invasion.



2.   Compare and contrast the nature of royal government in England and France.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the nature of royal government
     in England and France during the period from 1066 to 1223. Candidates may elect to offer full
     period coverage or they may choose to focus on a narrower period. Should a narrow period be
     selected, it is likely that candidates’ focus will be on approximately the same period in both states,
     however, there is no specific demand for this is in the question and it may be possible for
     candidates to offer some valid, albeit non-contemporaneous, comparisons and contrasts. While
     the focus of the response will remain on the nature of royal government, candidates may address
     contributory factors such as the personal authority of the monarch, the wealth of both states and/or
     the problems that government faced.

Section 2       Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   Discuss the reasons for Christian opposition to the Muslim states in Spain.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for Christian opposition to
     Muslim states. Candidates may cover the full period or choose to focus on specific periods where
     the opposition led to the decline of Muslim rule in Spain. Reasons for opposition could be related
     to the treatment of Christians within the Muslim states, for example the heavy taxation restrictions
     on clothing, church building and the practice of their religion. Candidates may also consider the
     wider context of the Christian kingdoms becoming stronger and more united and therefore more
     able to resist Muslim advances. There may be reference to the Crusading spirit or Reconquista as
     a reason for resistance, or to the fact that military successes, such as the capture of Toledo,
     encouraged further resistance.



4.   Discuss the role and contribution of Jews in medieval Europe.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the level of integration of Jews in
     society. There may be consideration of the position of Jews in society and whether there were
     differences in the position of Jews in different states. Jews were often treated as scapegoats and
     there was often very little positive acceptance of them, their role or the contributions. Some
     candidates may argue that despite this negative perception of Jews they made some positive
     contributions to society. Discussion of their contribution could focus on areas such as finance,
     trade, scholarship, and medicine. Some candidates may argue that the position of Jews became
     more difficult after the Black Death and in some instances, they became segregated from society
     (for example in the Ghetto in Venice).
                                                 –8–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3       Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Discuss the reasons why the French defeated the English in the Hundred Years War.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the main reasons for the French victory
     in the Hundred Years War. They may comment on factors such as leadership: Henry VI was a
     weak leader who desired peace while the French were united under a strong monarchy, especially
     after the events surrounding Joan of Arc. The relative military strength of both sides may also be
     mentioned as the French had a well-trained army on permanent standby whereas the English were
     overstretched. The English also lacked allies and finances for new recruits. They may argue that
     a culmination of these factors led to the English defeat, or they may argue that ultimately, France
     had the long-term advantage as they were fighting on home ground.



6.   Evaluate the impact of the Wars of the Roses on royal authority in England.

     Candidates are required to appraise the effects of the Wars of the Roses in terms of their impact
     on royal authority in England. Candidates may evaluate the authority of individual monarchs at
     different stages of the wars, for example royal authority was weak under Henry VI due to the threat
     from “over-mighty” subjects such as Warwick. It was not until the second reign of Edward IV that
     royal authority was restored to some extent. Royal authority was again undermined by the minority
     of Edward V and the dubious legitimacy of Richard III’s reign. Some may argue that the failure of
     successive monarchs to end the conflict between York and Lancaster undermined Royal authority
     over the whole period and that the conflict was resolved by the marriage of Henry VII and Elizabeth
     of York.
                                                 –9–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4       The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Compare and contrast the characteristics of government in Florence and Venice.

     Candidates are required to give an account of the similarities and differences between the
     characteristics of government in Florence and Venice during the period from c1400 to 1600. In
     doing so, they may consider factors including leadership, stability and personnel. Other areas to
     consider may include the relative power of individuals or families such as the Medici in Florence
     and how those families gained political influence. In Florence, wealth equated with political power
     but in Venice wealth did not always mean access to power. In broader terms both states were
     republics but not democratic and both used repression to try and maintain stability. Candidates
     may also consider the relative complexity of the government structure in both states.



8.   Discuss the reasons why the Renaissance spread to Burgundy and Germany.

     Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of a range of reasons why the
     Renaissance spread to Burgundy and Germany. Candidates may argue that factors, such as trade
     and the wealth of some states, supported the spread of Renaissance ideas, as did the increased
     availability of books. The importance of individuals such as Durer may also be considered.
     Candidates may argue that the northern Renaissance had distinctively different features, such as
     the influence of Christian humanism. They may also mention that political stability in areas such as
     Burgundy allowed new ideas to flourish as well. Some candidates may identify the influence of
     ideas developed during the Italian Renaissance on, for example, Burgundian and German cultural
     traditions of painting and architecture.

Section 5        The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    “Developments in cartography and navigation were the main factors that enabled Spanish and
      Portuguese exploration.” Discuss.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered review of the extent to which developments in
      cartography and navigation enabled and encouraged explorers to travel over much greater
      distances. They may refer to the fact that the publication of Ptolemy’s Geography stimulated
      geographical research as it made clear that the earth was spherical and that it might be possible to
      reach Asia by crossing the Atlantic. Candidates may also consider other factors such as the role
      played by commercial interests, patronage of influential leaders such as Henry the Navigator and
      the ambition of individual explorers. Technological developments, especially in shipbuilding, may
      be considered. Candidates may argue that navigation was less important as most voyages were
      close to land and navigational aids were initially unreliable.



10.   Evaluate the impact of the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) on Europe.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the importance of the Treaty of Tordesillas on
      Europe. Candidates may elect to write on the impact of the treaty on the relations between
      European states, for example the relations between Spain and Portugal. Insofar as impact on
      individual states is concerned, the focus may be on the possible economic benefits from the treaty,
      the acquisition of territory, the distribution of navigation zones and settlement areas or how this
      treaty challenged the Pope's authority. It was also, arguably, a new approach to negotiating as the
      views of experts were considered before the treaty was agreed, changing the nature of diplomacy.
                                                  – 11 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6        The Reformation (1517–1572)

11.   Evaluate the role of the German princes in the spread of Lutheran ideas in Germany up to 1547.

      Candidates are required to make an appraisal of the role of the princes in the spread of Lutheran
      ideas in Germany. They will consider how important the German princes were in actively
      spreading Lutheran ideas. They may also consider the role of the princes in protecting
      Lutheranism, or in trying to prevent an increase in the power of Charles V—even if they were
      Catholic. For balance, they may also refer to the role of Luther himself, the appeal of his ideas and
      how his treatises and other works supported German nationalism and anticlericalism. The benefits
      brought by the printing press could also be evaluated as could the conversion of many Imperial
      cities to Lutheranism. Answers must not go significantly beyond the Battle of Muhlberg.



12.   To what extent was the Catholic Church reformed between 1517 and 1563?

      Candidates are expected to consider the merits or otherwise of the view that the Catholic Church
      was reformed between the years 1517 and 1563 (the end of the Council of Trent). They may take
      the approach of identifying the perceived problems within the Church to give some context.
      However, the focus must be on the attempts to reform the Church and how far they were
      successful. Candidates may focus on the activities of reforming groups such as the Capuchins,
      Jesuits and Ursulines as well as the initial reluctance of some in the papal hierarchy to introduce
      reform. Some candidates may note that, despite pressure from the emergence of Protestantism
      and pressure from Charles V, it was not until 1545 that the Council of Trent convened for the first
      time. The key conclusions of the Council of Trent—in terms of doctrine and Church organizations,
      both at a diocesan level and within the papacy—may be cited as evidence of reform.

Section 7         Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the foreign policy of any two absolutist monarchs.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of two monarchs, weighing up the strengths and weaknesses of
      their foreign policy. Effectiveness could be measured in terms of military/dynastic success or the
      level of national security achieved, including the acquisition of territory that strengthened the power
      and influence of a given state in international affairs. In some instances, (Louis XVI or Frederick
      the Great, for example) it may be argued that that while their foreign policy was effective to some
      extent, there were also negative effects (famine, increased debt and financial and military costs).
      Possible absolutist monarchs for whom foreign policy was a key concern are, Peter the Great and
      Catherine the Great of Russia, Frederick the Great of Prussia, Charles XII of Sweden and Louis
      XIV of France. The chosen examples need not be from contemporaneous periods.



14.   Discuss the reasons for the growth of cities between 1650 and 1800.

      European populations suffered war, plague and famine in the first half of the 17th century.
      However, this pattern was reversed in the second half of the century and the population of cities
      grew, especially after 1700. Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons
      for this growth: insufficient work in rural areas, which led to migration to cities, and improvements in
      production, which reduced the number of famines and thus stabilized populations. The decline in
      the number of significant plague epidemics also led to a growth in population and an increase in
      the size of cities. Economic activity also encouraged the movement of people to cities, for example
      London expanded because of overseas trade with the British Empire, especially with India. Many
      people migrated to the cities to take advantage of the new opportunities that were becoming
      available.

Section 8        The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   Evaluate the reasons for French success in the Revolutionary Wars of 1792 to 1799.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for French success in the Revolutionary Wars.
      Attempts by foreign powers to invade France and destroy the Revolution failed. The reasons for
      this may include the motivation of French troops to defend their country from invasions and the use
      of conscription, which enabled France to field large armies. Effective military leadership may also
      be a reason, as it may be suggested that Napoleon and his Marshals, who were appointed
      because of their military ability contributed to French success. For balance, candidates may focus
      on the weakness of France’s opponents, including their lack of unity and the withdrawal of various
      nations from the some of the coalitions. Opponents were often poorly organized and lacked
      popular support, so were unable to resist French invasion. Further, candidates may also point out
      that France was not entirely successful, noting problems in Egypt and their defeat at sea.



16.   Discuss the reasons for Napoleon’s rise to political power by 1799.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the problems of the Directory and the
      factors that led to Napoleon’s taking of political power in 1799. The weaknesses of the Directory
      that candidates refer to may include a lack of support because of military setbacks in Italy,
      economic crisis, the complaints of corruption and opposition from Monarchists and Republicans.
      The restricted electorate also undermined popular support for the regime, which was reliant on
      military backing to retain power. In contrast, Napoleon had popular support after his military
      success especially in Italy, where he had the backing of a military force for his coup d’état.
      Napoleon also had support within the Directory (Sieyès and Lucien Bonaparte). In general terms,
      there was a feeling that France needed a strong leader who guaranteed the gains of the revolution
      as well as maintaining order.

Section 9        France (1815–1914)

17.   Evaluate the reasons for the 1848 Revolution in France.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the 1848 Revolution in France by weighing up
      the weaknesses of Louis Philippe’s monarchy and the relative strength of the opposition to his
      regime. They may argue that it was primarily the weakness of the regime rather than the strength
      and unity of opposition that led to the Revolution. Economic problems such as rising food prices
      and unemployment caused opposition, especially in Paris. There was middle class opposition to
      the restricted franchise and reformers were active in the Banquet Movement. The regime was also
      considered to be repressive by the working class. Some candidates may point out that the working
      class wanted a republic whereas the middle class wanted moderate reform. As such, opposition
      was not entirely unified. A weak foreign policy also undermined support for the monarchy. In the
      short term, Louis Philippe could not rely on the National Guard and abdicated due to his fear of the
      Paris mob.



18.   To what extent was the foreign policy of Napoleon III successful?

      Candidates will consider the merits of the argument that Napoleon III’s foreign policy was
      successful, identifying his foreign policy goals and gauging the extent to which they were achieved.
      Napoleon’s goal was to restore French status and improve relations with other powers. Examples
      of successful foreign policy may include improved relations with Britain (especially through trade),
      the holding of the post-Crimean conference in Paris and gaining territory (Nice and Savoy) after the
      Italian war. France was perceived as a major power, which increased Napoleon III’s support at
      home. However, his foreign policy in the 1860s was largely a failure and lost France potential
      allies. Austria-Hungary was hostile after events in Mexico and Britain was suspicious of Napoleon
      III’s ambitions in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Rhineland. The alliance with Prussia was
      temporary and, by the time of the outbreak of war in 1870, France was isolated and was easily
      defeated.

Section 10        Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Discuss the reasons for social protest in Britain and Ireland between 1815 and 1848.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the various outbreaks of
      social protest in Britain and Ireland during the period in question. Candidates may argue that a
      combination of social and economic problems, many of which were intertwined, contributed to
      political unrest. Some candidates may suggest that the political structure itself was the cause of
      social and economic disparity. Examples of social protest may include Luddism, the Swing Riots,
      opposition to the Poor Law Amendment Act or opposition to the Corn Laws. Political protests
      were, overall, linked to the lack of representation in parliament and could include the Peterloo
      Massacre, the riots and unrest before the 1832 Reform Act and the growth of Chartism. Protests
      were also caused by government repression but these tended to be short lived (Peterloo and the
      Tolpuddle Martyrs).



20.   “Lloyd George’s ‘People’s Budget’ had a significant political and social impact.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the argument that the People’s Budget
      had a significant political and social impact. In terms of politics they could examine the relationship
      of the House of Commons and the House of Lords and political polarization in parliament. It could
      be argued that the crisis led to some political instability and thus to two elections in 1910.
      Candidates may argue that the Budget had limited social impact. However, in terms of its social
      impact, they may assess how far it affected living conditions and/or the social structure within
      Britain. Some candidates may argue that the fight to pass the budget through Parliament led to
      strong criticism of the aristocracy (Lloyd George’s “cost of a duke” speech) and a decline in
      deference.

Section 11        Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   Evaluate the contributions of Cavour and Mazzini to the unification of Italy.

      Candidates will weigh up the significance of the contributions of Cavour and Mazzini to the
      eventual unification of Italy. In appraising their impact, consideration may be given to how they
      contributed to the growth of nationalism and support for the unification of Italy. Candidates may
      also consider the practical successes of both men. Some may argue that Mazzini was vital as he
      was an inspiration for unification. He founded “Young Italy” and it may be suggested that his
      inspiration of Garibaldi would later prove to be a substantial contribution. However, Mazzini’s
      practical contributions were limited. It could be argued that Cavour was more significant because
      of his practical policies; he strengthened Piedmont, gained allies (Napoleon III) to support the
      region and seized opportunities in the Duchies. After Garibaldi’s 1860 expedition, Cavour
      persuaded Garibaldi to cede territory to Victor Emmanuel, thus contributing to the unification of
      most of Italy.



22.   “The Kulturkampf and the anti-socialist campaign were political failures for Bismarck.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the argument that the Kulturkampf and
      the anti-socialist campaign were political failures. They may identify Bismarck’s aims and assess
      how far they were achieved. Bismarck aimed to strengthen imperial rule by limiting the threat of
      social democracy and by unifying the empire. He did this by weakening the Catholics, whom he
      perceived to be (potentially) disloyal. The Kulturkampf (May Laws) were a series of laws against
      the influence of the Catholic Church and were withdrawn in 1887. Support for the Centre party
      increased and the Church maintained its influence. The campaigns against the Social Democrats
      led to increased support and, by 1912, they had become the largest party. Some candidates may
      point out that Bismarck’s social legislation was much more effective in countering the threat from
      socialism, as the SPD remained moderate.

Section 12       Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union
                 (1855–1924)

23.   With reference to the period up to 1914, discuss the economic developments that took place in
      Russia during the reigns of Alexander III and Nicholas II.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the economic developments
      that took place up to 1914. These may include attempts to expand industry and increase
      agricultural production, achieve currency stability and promote trade with other nations.
      Candidates may argue that although there were significant economic developments, Russia’s
      economy remained largely agricultural with low production levels. Despite attempts to stimulate
      production, for example the reduction in the Poll Tax and Stolypin’s Agrarian reforms, crop yields
      were still very low by 1912. Discussion of industrial developments that were encouraged by Witte,
      may include a commentary on levels of foreign investment, the growth of railways (in comparison
      to other major powers), the impact on production levels and the scale of change. There may be
      discussion of the extent to which Russia had developed a stable industrial economy by 1914 and
      the fact that agriculture remained the main economic activity for over 80 per cent of the population.



24.   Evaluate the role of coercion and terror in the consolidation of the Soviet state between 1917 and
      1924.

      Candidates will appraise the contribution made by coercion and terror in consolidating the Soviet
      state between 1917 and 1924. Evidence of coercion may include the closing of the Constituent
      Assembly and/or the forcing of ex-tsarist officers to serve in the Red Army. There may also be
      reference to levels of censorship and the promotion of Communist ideology. When evaluating the
      use of terror, candidates may refer to the Cheka and the Red Terror, the assassination of the
      Romanovs and the crushing of the Kronstadt Mutiny. Some candidate may elect to weigh the
      importance of coercion and terror against other factors. These may include: the popularity of the
      Bolsheviks, their victory in the civil war and Bolshevik policies such as the New Economic Policy
      (NEP). Candidates may discuss the fate of other political parties such as the Mensheviks and the
      Social Revolutionaries and the role of the one-party state policy.

Section 13       Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   With reference to the period up to 1914, examine the impact of Kaiser Wilhelm II’s foreign policy on
      Britain, France, Russia and Austria-Hungary.

      Candidates will consider the impact of Kaiser Wilhelm II’s foreign policy on Britain, France, Russia
      and Austria-Hungary. Candidates may focus on how relations between these powers and
      Germany were affected by the Kaiser’s foreign policy. They may also discuss whether the four
      countries’ wider foreign relations (for example with each other and other powers) were altered
      because of the Kaiser’s policy as well as any other effects it may have had on each or all of them.
      Candidates may consider how Britain became increasingly unlikely to form an alliance with
      Germany, noting the impact of issues such as the Kruger Telegram, the naval race and the
      Moroccan crises. Candidates may argue that the Kaiser’s foreign policy contributed to the Dual
      Alliance between France and Russia. They may also refer to the actions taken by Austria-Hungary
      that were supported by Germany, such as the Bosnian Crisis (1908) and the “blank cheque”
      (1914). While this is not a question about the causes of the First World War, candidates may
      argue that the wider impact of Wilhelm’s policies was the division of Europe into two opposing
      alliance systems.



26.   “Domestic instability was the main factor in Germany requesting an armistice in 1918.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that domestic problems
      were the main factor behind Germany requesting an armistice in 1918. When considering
      domestic problems there will be clear links as to how these affected the prosecution of the war.
      Evidence of domestic instability may include food riots after the “Turnip Winter”, major disturbances
      in industrial areas between January and February 1918, the Kiel Mutiny of October 1918 and the
      fear of revolution. These may all have contributed to the decision to request an armistice. Military
      factors discussed may include the failure of the Ludendorff Offensive and the Battle of Amiens.
      The fact that the military leaders had less influence on policy made an armistice more likely. The
      strength of the Allies and the belief that peace negotiations would be based on Wilson’s Fourteen
      Points could also be considered as relevant factors.

Section 14       European states in the inter-war years (1918–1939)

27.   “Opposition to the Nazi regime was limited and unsuccessful between 1933 and 1939.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of opposition activity to the regime
      including political and social opposition and opposition to specific policies. Political opposition
      could include the Socialist (SPD) vote against the Enabling Bill and the activities of the Social
      Democratic Part of Germany in Exile (SOPADE). Candidates may mention the opposition of the
      Reichswehr to Nazification up to 1938, and social opposition may include opposition to the Hitler
      Youth (Edelweiss Pirates and Navajos). Discussion of religious opposition may focus on the
      Confessional Church as well as opposition to specific policies (Bishop Galen and euthanasia) but
      candidates may also argue that, overall, the Church hierarchies offered little opposition.
      Candidates may argue that the regime was popular and opposition was limited in scope but
      successful in relation to specific policies. On the other hand, candidates may argue that it was
      limited because of the coercive nature of the Nazi state.



28.   Discuss the reasons for political polarization in Spain between 1931 and 1936.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why the political consensus
      of 1931 had been destroyed by 1936. Reasons could include ideology, the impact of specific
      policies, deep social divisions and various groups protecting their own interests. Some may argue
      that the underlying problem was social and economic disparity in Spanish society and that these
      were exacerbated by the policies of Azana. These policies included land reform, the reduction of
      Church influence, army reform and the Catalan Statute. There may also be reference to the CEDA
      (Catholic right party) dominated governments of 1933 to 1935. The crushing of the Asturian Rising
      and the Biennio Negro increased these divisions. The presence of extreme groups on the right
      (the Monarchists and Falange) and on the left (the anarchists/CNT and the Spanish socialist party)
      also contributed to political polarization. The violence associated with politics reduced the
      possibility of dialogue and compromise.

Section 15       Versailles to Berlin: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   “The policy of appeasement was necessary because, by the mid-1930s, collective security had
      failed.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits of the suggestion that appeasement was a consequence of the
      failure of collective security by the mid-1930s. Candidates may address the reasons why Britain
      and France, as Guarantor powers, adopted the policy of appeasement. These could include
      domestic priorities as well as the international context. The weakness of the League of Nations by
      1936 and its inability to effectively contain aggression was evidence of the failure of collective
      security. The fear of war with aggressive states could arguably be the overarching reason for
      appeasement. Some candidates may argue that appeasement was used to buy time for
      rearmament. In Britain appeasement was adopted because a strong Germany acted as a buffer to
      the Soviet Union. Also, in Britain, many people argued that Versailles had been too harsh and that
      France was too unstable to be a reliable ally, and would struggle to continue to maintain it.
      Further, France was too weak to act alone in foreign policy and had similar reasons to Britain for
      favouring appeasement.



30.   Examine the impact of the Second World War on the civilian populations of two countries in
      Europe between 1939 and 1945.

      Candidates will consider the impact of the Second World War on the civilian populations of two
      countries for the duration of the war. One area to consider may be increased government
      intervention in economic activity, which had an impact on the civilian population. Depending on the
      examples chosen, candidates may discuss the number of civilian casualties from invasion or
      bombing raids. A major impact of the war was rationing as there were severe food shortages.
      Further, there was a significant impact on standards of living and dislocation of the civilian
      population (either through evacuation or military activities). In addition, candidates may examine
      the mobilization of the workforce, increasing government control and the direction of labour into
      key industries, as well as the mobilization of women into the work force. In occupied countries, the
      civilian population may have experienced a more repressive regime.

Section 16       The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   Evaluate the significance of propaganda to the maintenance of Stalin’s power between 1929 and
      1945.

      Candidates will appraise the importance of propaganda to Stalin in his efforts to sustain support for
      his rule. There may be, for example, reference to the Cult of Personality. Propaganda was used
      to control and encourage the population, to support and implement policies such as the Five Year
      Plans (Stakhanovite Movement), as well as to justify the repressive policies of the state. The Show
      Trials may be considered as propaganda. Propaganda was important in encouraging national
      resistance during the Second World War as it emphasized the need to protect the Motherland.
      Some candidates may argue that the nature of propaganda evolved as priorities changed, as it
      was much more nationalistic during the war. Candidates may weigh up the importance of other
      policies that supported Stalin’s maintenance of power. They may argue that propaganda was
      merely the public face of a repressive one-party state.



32.   To what extent did Yeltsin establish democracy in Russia in the period from 1991 to 1999?

      Candidates will consider the merits of the given statement and are likely to focus on political
      activity and the constitutional structure of post-Soviet Russia. This may include references to, the
      extent of presidential power, the use of presidential decrees and the ability of the president to
      govern without reference to parliament. Constitutional change increased presidential powers and
      the power of the Duma was limited. Candidates may also comment on the power and influence on
      government policy of major groups and organizations such as political parties, the army and
      oligarchs. Evidence of democracy may include the existence of a range of political parties,
      elections and the fact that some (reasonably) well-conducted referenda were held. Evidence that
      democracy was eroded may include the high levels of corruption and the fact that Yeltsin was able
      to nominate his own successor, Putin, who was elected in 2000 after a campaign in which it was
      alleged that he controlled the electoral system and the media.

Section 17        Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   Discuss the role of de Gaulle in stabilizing France between 1958 and 1969.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypotheses that De Gaulle stabilized
      France after the problematic Fourth Republic. There may be some identification of the problems
      that led to the collapse of the Fourth Republic; but the focus will be on de Gaulle’s leadership and
      policies. There may be consideration of how effectively he solved political, social and economic
      problems and there may be comments on his role as a unifying figure and a strong leader under
      the terms of the new constitution. Evidence of increased stability may include his resolving of the
      Algerian war and fewer changes of government. Some candidates may argue that stability was
      limited as little was done to address underlying economic and social problems. The events of May
      1968 could be cited as evidence of this. An alternative view could be that the events of 1968 did
      not seriously threaten political institutions.



34.   To what extent was there social and cultural change in West Germany between 1949 and 1989?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that German society and culture
      may have been altered by the experiences of occupation and division. Candidates must focus on
      social and cultural changes and not political changes. Areas to consider may include the impact of
      foreign occupation on cultural identity (for example, Americanization) or the impact of immigration
      (Gastarbeiter) on population demographics. The changing role of women in society and its impact
      on family life and employment conditions, as well as social attitudes, may be a key area for
      consideration. There may be some comment on the extent to which traditional institutions such as
      the Church (of either denomination) retained influence on family life and education, and whether
      there was any significant change in social structure (by examining the influence of elites on politics
      and the economy).

Section 18       Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Evaluate Yugoslavia’s challenge to Soviet control under Tito.

      Candidates will appraise the extent to which Soviet control was resisted—both politically and
      economically—in Tito’s Yugoslavia. Areas to consider may include the nature of the state,
      economic activity and international relations. The state structure was modelled on the Soviet
      Union and there was repression of opposition groups. Economically, Tito wanted to accept
      Marshall Aid and to trade with the West. The economy did not follow the COMECON model but
      economic enterprises remained in public ownership. Tito also conducted his own foreign policy
      and was a leading member of the Non-Aligned movement. Some candidates may argue that
      Yugoslavia’s challenge was limited as the country was perceived to be a member of the Eastern
      Bloc during the Cold War period. Other candidates may argue that Yugoslavia followed its own
      road to communism, particularly where they reference foreign relations and the economy.



36.   Between 1945 and 1968, to what extent was there support for Soviet control in two of the
      following: East Germany; Poland; Hungary; Czechoslovakia?

      Candidates will consider the merits of the suggestion that there was some support for Soviet
      dominance between 1945 and 1968. Initial levels of support can be indicated by the electoral
      support for communist parties in the first elections. On the other hand, candidates may argue that
      elections were often, but not always, managed. When evaluating continued support for Soviet
      control, there may be some reference to the causes and extent of demonstrations, for example, if
      they were economic or political, or if the regime was closely linked to the Soviet Union. For
      example, Novotny in Czechoslovakia was closely linked to Moscow whereas Gomulka in Poland
      was, to some extent, able to pursue his own economic policies if Poland remained loyal to the
      Warsaw Pact. When considering the 1950s and 1960s, it may be argued that opposition to Soviet
      control increased; however, this may not have been accompanied by a desire to abandon
      socialism.
