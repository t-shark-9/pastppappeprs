                                                   Section A
Microeconomics

1.   (a)       A fall in income leads to a fall in demand for a good. Explain this relationship
               between the demand for the good and consumer income.                                 [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definitions of demand, income, income elasticity of demand, normal good
               • diagram to show how a fall in income leads to a fall in demand for a normal
                 good
               • explanation that the positive income elasticity of demand means the good is
                 a normal good
               • examples of normal goods, necessities.

               Award a maximum of level 2 if there is no mention of normal goods and/or
               income elasticity.

(b)   Evaluate the consequences of rising incomes on service sector producers (such as
      hotels) and primary sector producers (such as rice farmers).                       [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of service sector, primary sector good
      • diagrams to show changes in the demand for goods produced by the
        service sector and primary sector as income rises
      • explanation that a rise in income leads to a rise in demand for normal
        goods produced by the service sector like hotels and how a rise in income
        leads to a less significant rise in demand for necessity goods produced in
        the primary sector like rice (other examples could be used as long as
        reference is made to the correct sector)
      • examples of how demand for normal goods and necessity goods changes
        as incomes change
      • synthesis or evaluation.

      Award a maximum of level 2 if the focus is only on supply as this is a poor
      interpretation of the question.

      Both the primary and the service sectors need to be covered accurately to go
      beyond the mid-point of level 2.

      Evaluation may include: consideration that there are some types of service
      sector goods, such as budget hotels that might experience a fall in demand as
      incomes rise; that some low income consumers may increase their demand
      significantly for rice as their incomes rise.

2.   (a)   Explain why the consumption of merit goods, such as healthy food, can lead to
           positive externalities of consumption.                                            [10]

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of positive externalities, merit goods
           • diagram(s) to show the positive externality of consumption
           • explanation of how healthy food will be under-consumed in a competitive
             market because the MSB is greater than the MPB (can use any example of
             a merit good)
           • examples of where the consumption of merit goods has led to positive
             externalities.

           externalities that could occur with the merit good described, for example, less
           government spending on health care.

(b)   Discuss whether advertising by the government is the most appropriate way of
      increasing consumption of a merit good.                                           [15]

        advertising

        the MSB curve
      • examples of specific policies governments have used
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: whether advertising will influence demand, other
      factors that influence the demand for merit goods, alternatives to advertising
      like subsidies, legislation and direct provision.

             mechanism
           • examples of countries that have increased interest rates.

           Award a maximum of level 2 if the response fails to link the increase in interest
           rates to at least two components of AD.

(b)   Discuss whether the use of fiscal policy is the most effective way to bring an
      economy out of a recession.                                                        [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of fiscal policy, recession
      • diagram to show how an increase in AD will increase real GDP
      • explanation of how fiscal policy involves an increase in government
        spending or a decrease in taxes or both; how an increase in government
        spending might create a multiplier effect on the economy leading to an
        increase in real GDP
      • examples of the use of fiscal policy
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the limitations of fiscal policy like the effect on the
      government budget, time lags, the difficulty of promoting economic activity in a
      recession and the significance of the multiplier effect. There may also be
      reference to alternative policies like monetary and supply-side.

4.   (a)   Explain the factors that cause demand-pull and cost-push inflation.               [10]

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of inflation, demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation
           • diagrams to show demand-pull inflation (increase in AD) and cost-push
             inflation (decrease in SRAS)
           • explanation of demand-pull in terms of factors which increase AD,
             particularly at or near to full employment, and cost-push in terms of rising
             costs of factors of production
           • examples of inflation in different countries.

(b)   Discuss the view that deflation will always be bad for an economy.                [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of deflation
      • diagram to show deflation (shift of AD to the left and/or shift of AS to the
        right)
      • explanation of the negative effects of deflation, eg delayed consumption,
        investment, downward deflationary spiral, possibility of financial crisis,
        worse position for debtors/borrowers
      • examples of deflation in different countries
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of the possible benefits of deflation, eg
      increased export competitiveness, caused by increases in AS and benefits to
      savers. Consideration of the word “always”.
