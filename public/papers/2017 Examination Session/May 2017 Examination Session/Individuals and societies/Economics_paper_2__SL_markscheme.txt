           (ii)   Define the term economic growth indicated in bold in the text
                  (paragraph ).                                                                 [2]

                      An explanation that it is one of the following:
                      • an increase in real GDP
                      • an increase in the real value of output (over time)
                      • an increase in potential output.

(b)   Using an international trade diagram, explain the impact on the Kenyan
      government of implementing a tariff on steel imports.                                    [4]

       Level                                                                           Marks

       1        There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.            1–2
                For drawing a correctly labelled tariff diagram showing a shift
                upwards of the world supply curve, with enough labelling so that
                it is possible to indicate, in some way, the area representing
                government revenue or for providing an explanation that the
                tariff causes the world supply curve to shift upwards (or the tariff
                causes the price to rise), creating government revenue [1] with
                the amount referenced to the diagram [2].
       2        There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.           3–4
                For drawing a correctly labelled tariff diagram showing a shift
                upwards of the world supply curve (with enough labelling so that
                it is possible to indicate, in some way, the area representing
                government revenue) and for providing an explanation that the
                tariff causes the world supply curve to shift upwards (or the tariff
                causes the price to rise), creating government revenue [1] with
                the amount referenced to the diagram [2].

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of [3].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for an international trade diagram.
      The world supply curve must be labelled Sw, or Sworld. A title is not necessary.

      Candidates who use P and Q values to indicate the government revenue, eg
      (Q2Q3 x PW+T – PW), should be fully rewarded.

(c)   Using an exchange rate diagram, explain why a deficit in the current account may
      result in downward pressure on the Kenyan shilling (Kenya’s currency)
      (paragraph ).                                                                           [4]

       1        There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.            1–2
                For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram showing
                a shift of the supply curve to the right and a fall in the exchange
                rate or for an explanation that a current account deficit means
                that there will be more currency leaving the country to pay for
                imports, than coming in from the sale of exports, and so the
                supply of the shilling on the international money market
                increases, lowering its value.
       2        There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.           3–4
                For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram showing
                a shift of the supply curve to the right and a fall in the exchange
                rate and for an explanation that a current account deficit means
                that there will be more currency leaving the country to pay for
                imports, than coming in from the sale of exports, and so the
                supply of the shilling on the international money market
                increases, lowering its value.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of [3].

      For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price of
      shilling in another currency, other currency/shilling or other currency per shilling.
      The horizontal axis should be quantity, or quantity of shillings. A title is not
      necessary.

      Candidates may state that the deficit means that overall there has been less
      demand for the currency because there has been less demand for the country’s
      exports, thus causing a shift in the demand curve to the left and a fall in the value
      of the shilling. If properly explained, with a correct diagram, then this approach
      may be fully rewarded.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, evaluate
      the claim that trade protection measures will support economic growth in Kenya.          [8]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • definition of trade protection measures.

      Strengths of protectionist measures:
      • infant industry argument – allows steel and iron industry time to become
         internationally competitive, which can bring about growth
      • helps diversify economy away from over reliance on primary exports, which is
         necessary for sustained growth (paragraph )
      • create more jobs thus increase consumption, AD and growth (+ diagram)
         (paragraph )
      • raises government revenue (paragraph ) that can be invested by the
         government in ways that will promote growth
      • if imports are being unfairly subsidized, protectionism will level the playing field
         (paragraph )
      • can help correct the persistent current account deficit, which is hindering growth
         (paragraph ).

Limitations of protectionist measures:
• does not encourage long term efficiency, which may be better achieved through
   deregulation (paragraph )
• inefficient allocation of resources argument
• protected industries can become over-reliant on government support and so may
   not contribute to economic growth
• politically difficult to remove protectionist measure once in place
• revenue from tariffs can be subject to corruption
• potential problems of retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, which could damage
   Kenya’s exports and thus threaten future growth
• removing barriers and deregulation (administrative barriers) rather than
   protectionism could encourage domestic entrepreneurship and FDI which will
   support growth
• tariffs increase “cost of doing business” (paragraph ) for those producers reliant
   on imported components
• higher prices on steel and iron which will increase input costs for construction and
   infrastructure projects – necessary for economic growth
• higher input costs may reduce SRAS, causing a reduction in real GDP,
   threatening growth.

Any reasonable discussion.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Possible negative consequences include:
      • “Australian mining companies are losing significant revenue” due to the fall in
        demand for exports (paragraph )
      • “falling iron ore prices create downward pressure on economic growth” because
        mining profits fall, forcing mining companies to cut back on hiring and
        growth-oriented investment (paragraph )
      • possibility of imported inflation through higher priced imports leading to higher
        input costs for manufacturers
      • weak economy makes it difficult for central bank to raise interest rates to support
        the dollar (paragraph )
      • falling value of currency can lead to low business confidence and uncertainty
      • cutting interest rates will further depreciate the Australian dollar exacerbating a
        deterioration in the balance of trade and current account (paragraph )
      • depreciating currency increases outflows on income line of current account as
        more dollars required to exchange for foreign currencies with which to pay
        income obligations – worsens current account deficit
      • may lead to speculative outflows due to concerns that the Australian dollar is
        likely to depreciate further, leading to further downward pressure.

Possible positive consequences include:
• “persistent weakness in non-mining sectors” – depreciating currency likely to
  reduce relative price of service exports (tourism and education) thus improve
  balance of trade in services (paragraph )
• can encourage inflows on financial account as Australian assets are cheaper.

Possible mixed consequences include:
• Australian commodity exports should be more competitive but “slowing growth in
  China” likely to offset any gains from fall in relative price of commodity exports
• mixed impact on balance of trade – likely to improve services but less likely to
  improve goods because of dependency on commodity exports “Iron ore is
  Australia’s largest export” (paragraph ).

Any reasonable discussion that offers a considered and balanced review of the
possible effect of a depreciating currency on Australia’s economic growth.

      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of economic development
      • definition of market-oriented reforms/policies.

Possible positive effects:
• investing in infrastructure (paragraph ) to improve infrastructure (paragraph ),
  reducing the cost of economic activity
• opening up financial system (paragraph ) may encourage foreign banks and
  increased lending to business, thus increased capital formation in the long-run,
  possible shift in LRAS to the right
• liberalizing the currency (paragraph  and ) allows for greater access to credit
  and encourages tourism and business (paragraph )
• trade deals (liberalization) (paragraph ) may promote export growth, reducing
  current account deficit, creating (youth) employment and increasing household
  incomes (paragraph )
• reducing bureaucracy (paragraph ) which would reduce the cost of doing
  business
• privatization of state-owned enterprise may lead to greater efficiency and more
  reliable power supply in the energy generation industry (paragraph  and )
  supporting industry efficiency
• creating 46 economic zones with low tax rates may encourage FDI leading to
  increased AD and job creation to tackle high youth unemployment (paragraph )
• creation of economic zones likely to increase manufacturing and industrialization
  encouraging a shift away from low income agricultural jobs to higher income
  manufacturing jobs thereby tackling the large percentage of the population living
  on less than US$2.50 per day (paragraph )
• potential for increased government revenue to repay debt by privatizing
  state-owned enterprises (paragraph )
• export-led growth and the attraction of FDI (paragraph ) - Sri Lanka is actively
  encouraging FDI so trade and investment are likely to increase, thus increasing
  AD, and/or LRAS, and possibly breaking the poverty trap
• easier for businesses to register (paragraph )
• improving access to credit for small companies and increasing long-run potential
  output – creates jobs (paragraph ).

Possible negative effects:
• increased unemployment
• privatizations of utilities could result in higher utility prices thus harming low
  income households
• possible negative externalities created by the opening of the economic zones
• possibility of increased income inequality in the distribution of income
• privatized firms may have monopoly power
• FDI may lead to more outflows of incomes on the current account
• liberalization of currency markets (paragraph ) may lead to capital flight
  (outflows on financial account).

Any reasonable discussion.
