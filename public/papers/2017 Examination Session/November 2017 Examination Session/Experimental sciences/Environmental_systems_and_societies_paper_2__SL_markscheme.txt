                                               Section A

1.   (a)   (i)    Define the term carrying capacity.                                                    [1]

                  the maximum number of individuals/load of a species that can be sustainably
                  supported by a given area/habitat/environment OWTTE;

                  NB. Definition needs to make clear that cc is associated with a single
                  species. This means that: “The maximum number of a species that
                  can...etc” is acceptable, but “the maximum number of species that can…” is
                  incorrect, and should not be credited.

           (ii)   Identify three reasons why carrying capacity can be difficult to estimate.         [3 max]

                  Generally:
                  there are many different potential limiting factors for natural populations;
                  populations’ needs may change through time due to genetic
                  changes/evolution;
                  environmental conditions may change eg climate change/introduced species;
                  it takes extensive/long-term study to identify a precise relationship between a
                  species and given environmental factor;
                  For human populations:
                  human populations exploit/depend upon a far greater range of different
                  resources than most other species;
                  (human ingenuity) humans are able to substitute one resource/material for
                  another;
                  variations in lifestyle/culture/economic status between human populations
                  mean different resources/amounts of resources are used/needed;
                  the importation of resources from other ecosystems/regions can offset a lack
                  of resources in an area;
                  technological developments cause changes in resources required/available
                  over time;

                  Award [1] for each correct reason identified, up to [3 max]

                  Do not credit responses addressing changing population size (has no
                  influence on carrying capacity).

     (b)   (i)    With reference to Figure 1 calculate the DT for India (X).                            [1]

                  50 (years);

           (ii)   With reference to Figure 1 calculate the NIR for Japan (Y).                           [1]

                  −0.2 (%);

     (c)   Identify two reasons why Uruguay has the biggest ecological footprint.                   [2 max]

           high usage of resources / high standard of living;
           limited local vegetation/natural habitat/primary productivity to absorb CO2/wastes;
           local food production is limited/unsustainable/poorly managed;
           high usage of/dependence upon fossil fuels/high CO2 emissions / lack of
           alternative/renewable energy sources;
           unregulated/high production of industrial/domestic pollution/waste products;
           meat-rich diet;
           Do not credit responses suggesting “limited land/high pop density” ...not valid.
                                                    –4–                N17/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



           Award [1] for each correct reason identified, up to [2 max].


2.   (a)   (i)    Define biodiversity.                                                                 [1]

                  biodiversity is a broad concept encompassing the total diversity of living
                  systems / biodiversity includes the species, habitat and genetic diversity
                  within an area / the amount of biological diversity per unit area; OWTTE;
                  Award [1 max] for a correct definition.

           (ii)   With reference to Figure 2 identify three factors that could explain the high
                  biodiversity in Ecuador.                                                         [3 max]

                  close to the equator/high primary productivity/favourable climate/high
                  rainfall/insolation;
                  (Ecuador is in latitude of) tropical rainforest biome (which is a biodiversity
                  hotspot);
                  (greater species/genetic diversity due to) high habitat diversity/climatic
                  zones/biomes/range of coastal/lowland/forest systems;
                  active plate tectonics creating barriers to populations (and so encourages
                  speciation);
                  altitude variation on mountains (create zonation/diversity of habitats);
                  active plate tectonics enabling succession (from volcanic material/lava/
                  lahars etc);
                  large protected area/national park;

                  Award [1] for each correct factor identified, up to [3 max].

     (b)          Describe a method that may have been used for collecting the tree data in Figure 3.
                                                                                               [2 max]

           identify from the leaf canopy the different species seen;

           OR

           use quadrat sampling/sampling points along a transect;
           identify and count all the different species seen in quadrats/along transect;

           OR

           collect live specimens of leaves/fruits/seeds etc from the unit area;
           have them identified (in labs) using keys/expert botanists;

           Award [1] for each step identified up to [2 max].

           Do not credit responses that address abundance rather than number of different
           species.
                                                –5–                 N17/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   With reference to Figure 4 estimate the population size of ocelots in
      Yasuni National Park for Site B.                                                              [1]

          40 × 35
      (           = ) 46.67 Accept answers from 46 - 47 (ocelot population size);
            30

(d)   Outline two reasons for the differences in population size and density of ocelots at
      Site A and B of Yasuni National Park as shown in Figure 4.                           [4 max]

           traps in area A may be more easily avoided/too obvious/have traces of
           disturbance/be located in spots less used by ocelots/in area B be less easily
           avoided/better hidden/cause less disturbance/be located close to ocelot
           nests/hunting routes;
           ...causing trap-shy individuals in A/trap-happy individuals in B/overestimating
           population in A/underestimating population in B;

           population may be greater in site A because it provides greater quantity/quality
           of resources/favourable factors eg food/shelter/water (or converse for site B ie
           less food/shelter/water);
           ...leading to greater immigration of ocelots/more successful
           reproduction/population growth in site A (or converse for Site B);

           population may be lower in site B due to presence of more adverse factors eg
           disease/competitors (or converse for site A ie less disease/competition);
           ...leading to less immigration of ocelots/greater death rate/lower fertility in site B
           (or converse for site A);

           population may be lower in site B due to higher levels of human disturbance (or
           converse for site A ie less disturbance);
           ...leading to more emigration of ocelots/greater death rate/reduced
           reproduction/loss of nesting sites in site B (or converse for site A);

           Award 1 max for the possible cause and 1 max for linking it appropriately to
           either higher density in site A or lower density in site B.

           N.B. If candidate has miscalculated population size of site B in part c, such that
           it is GREATER than for site A, then apply ECF and credit responses that
           provide valid reasons for B>A.

3.   (a)   (i)    Identify one human factor that contributes to photochemical smog.               [1]

                  (intensive) combustion of fossil fuels/organic matter/through high density
                  traffic/urbanisation/industrialisation/forest burning/release of VOCs from
                  aerosols;

           (ii)   Identify one natural factor that contributes to photochemical smog.             [1]

                  local topography/high insolation/sunlight/low wind/thermal inversion;

     (b)   Explain why the formation of photochemical smog may have harmful effects on the
           environment of cities such as Santiago (Chile).                                 [4 max]

           reduced growth and productivity of plants/reduces crop yields by damaging them;
           leads to the reduction of the air quality/visibility/ambience within the urban area;
           particulates/chemicals within the smog enter the lungs and irritate respiratory
           system/cause respiratory disease/lung cancer;
           particulates/chemicals within the smog may cause irritation of eyes/eye diseases;
           the chemicals within the smog react with plastic/rubber causing it to perish/
           become hard/inflexible;
           tropospheric ozone (a secondary pollutant) is a greenhouse gas/contributes to
           global warming/climate change;
           smog pollutants reduce immune system of humans and animals (become more
           susceptible to diseases);

           Award [1] for each correct explanation, up to [4 max].
                                                 –7–                N17/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                              Section B

4.   (a)   Describe the role of primary producers in ecosystems.                                  [4 max]

           producers are plants that convert light energy into chemical energy by
           photosynthesis;
           photosynthesis/primary producers convert carbon dioxide and water into
           glucose/sugar and oxygen;
           this conversion/glucose forms the raw material of biomass/the basis of food chains;
           producers (thereby) provide food for consumers/energy in a form that can be
           passed along food chains;
           the production of oxygen by producers is vital for the majority of ecosystems;
           the absorption of CO2 maintains a balance of CO2 in atmosphere/reduces global
           warming;
           primary producers may alternatively generate biomass through chemosynthesis;
           chemosynthetic bacteria use chemical energy to produce food without using
           sunlight;
           plants may also provide other resources/services for ecosystem eg habitats/soil
           conservation/cycling of matter;

           Award [1] for each correct role described, up to [4 max].

     (b)   Explain the potential impact of ocean acidification on environmental systems and
           societies.                                                                       [7 max]

           ocean acidification is caused by increased CO2 levels in atmosphere leading to
           more CO2 absorbed into ocean;
           the CO2 reacts with the water forming an acid (carbonic acid)/decreasing the
           pH/changing pH from about 8.2 to 8.1;
           macro-algae/seagrasses may benefit from higher CO2 conditions in the ocean;
           some organisms are adapted to a narrow pH range/very sensitive to pH changes;
           low pH/reduces ability of shelled organisms to maintain their shells/reduces
           reproductive ability in fish/shellfish;
           producers eg phytoplankton/corals in ocean environments can be particularly
           sensitive to low pH;
           corals are more prone to bleaching/less able to recover from damage in acidified
           water;
           reduction in producers reduces the resilience of an ecosystem/impacts entire food
           webs/is a potential tipping point for marine systems/reduces biodiversity;
           collapse of a natural ecosystem may lead to collapse of fisheries/collapse of
           aquaculture (eg oysters)/overfishing of diminishing fish populations;
           loss of fisheries can lead to limited food supply for indigenous communities/need to
           import food;
           decline in fishing/aquaculture would result in reduced employment/socio-economic
           hardship;
           coral reefs support economically valuable ecotourism that may be lost/decline;
           loss of corals will bring an aesthetic loss/infringe biorights of organisms;

           Do not credit responses that mistakenly address acid deposition.
           Award 2 max for describing process of acidification.
           Award 5 max if impacts are limited only to ecosystems or only to societies.

           Award [1] for each correct explanation, up to [7 max].

(c)   To what extent do anthropocentric value systems dominate the international efforts to
      address climate change?                                                             [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
      the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:

      •   understanding concepts and terminology of
          anthropocentric/technocentric/ecocentric values, sustainability, climate change,
          global warming, C emission, international NGOs/GOs, international
          agreements/protocols, mitigation, adaptation, MEDCs v LEDCs etc
      •   breadth in addressing and linking international strategies addressing climate
          change relevant EVS e.g. anthropocentric with environmental regulations,
          carbon tax, international agreements/protocols eg technocentric with carbon
          storage, alternative energies, vaccination programmes, desalinisation, flood
          defences, eg ecocentric with afforestation, energy reduction, reduced
          consumerism, more sustainable/localised agricultural systems etc
      •   examples of international strategies eg Kyoto protocol, Paris Agreement, UN
          Convention on Climate Change, carbon trading, REDD (Reduced Emissions
          from Deforestation & Degradation), and range of strategies employed
          internationally eg desalinisation in areas of water scarcity, flood defences in
          coastal regions, shifting cultivation to more appropriate latitudes, Greenpeace
          global aim for 100% renewable energy etc
      •   balanced analysis of the extent to which international efforts are dominated by
          anthropocentric values, acknowledging relevant counter-arguments/alternative
          viewpoints
      •   a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
          examples given eg “All value systems have a valuable contribution in
          addressing climate change, but anthropocentric values are particularly critical
          in achieving a more concerted effort internationally in that technological
          solutions are often limited to MEDCs and ecocentric solutions tend to be very
          localised.” NB This is only an example of a possible conclusion. Candidates’
          conclusions do not have to agree.

      Please see markbands on page 20.

5.   (a)   Distinguish between the concept of a “charismatic” (flagship) species and a keystone
           species using named examples.                                                      [4 max]

           Award 1 mark for two valid examples (one of each kind)
           charismatic/flagship eg Panda/Tiger and keystone eg Northern Spotted Owl/Sea
           Stars/Fig Trees/Sea Otters/Jaguar;

           Award 3 max for valid points of distinction:
           charismatic/flagship species are used to publicise/advertise conservation
           campaigns/stimulate public action/raise economic support;
           ...they are selected because they appeal to humans/have
           ideological/cultural/religious significance;
           their value is primarily subjective/relative to a society rather than ecological;
           keystone species have a disproportionately large effect on their environment/may
           determine structure of an ecosystem/have many other species dependent on them;
           keystone species may be publicly unpopular/threat to locals/considered pests/killed
           for fur/trophy;
           they are identified through ecological/scientific/objective study of their relationships
           with the entire ecosystem;

           While it is acceptable to award a mark for stating a discriminatory feature of just
           one kind of species (without referring to contrasting feature of the other), do not
           credit directly converse statements twice e.g. “flagship are X ...keystone are not X”
           would gain only 1 mark if X was valid.

     (b)   Explain the role of two historical influences in shaping the development of the
           environmental movement.                                                                    [7 max]

           eg Rachel Carson – Author of Silent Spring (1962);
           Silent Spring documented/highlighted the problems caused by the widespread use
           of synthetic pesticides;
           focus was placed on the activities of chemical companies;
           explained impact of use of insecticides/pesticides on birds of prey;
           led to widespread awareness amongst (American) public of environmental
           issues/bioaccumulation/biomagnification;
           was a focal point for the social/environmental movements of the 1960s;
           inspired many other environmentalists;
           led to ban on DDT for agricultural uses;
           inspired the formation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency;

           eg Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011;
           a natural disaster/earthquake/tsunami led to the biggest nuclear disaster since
           Chernobyl at Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant;
           estimates vary about the number of people affected by the disaster/no direct
           deaths initially/over 600 deaths by workers/thousands with increased risk of
           cancers;
           as the disaster was able to happen in a “developed” country like Japan, many
           societies came to the conclusion that nuclear power could not be “safe”;
           this has led to increased public pressure to phase out nuclear power generation;
           eg Germany sped up plans to close nuclear reactors/over 90 % of Italy voted
           against government plans to expand nuclear power/Switzerland also decided to
           phase out nuclear power;

      Award [1max] for correctly identifying/naming two historical influences.
      Award credit for valid statements that describe the personality/event; explain how it
      has influenced the movement; and explain exactly what gave rise to the influence.
      If more than two events/personalities are addressed credit only the highest-scoring
      two.
      Award [4max] for each explanation of how historical influences shaped the
      development of environmentalism up to max of 7 marks.

(c)   Discuss the implications of environmental value systems for the protection of tropical
      biomes.                                                                              [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
      the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of environmental value systems,
         tropical biomes, biodiversity, conservation, habitat v species approach,
         reserves, ecotourism, flagship species, sustainable development/exploitation,
         goods/services.
      • breadth in addressing and linking environmental value systems with each
         other and ecocentric values with biorights, wilderness reserves, restrained
         resource use, etc and anthropocentric values with laws/regulations/quotas,
         public consultation/agreements, sustainable exploitation, ecotourism etc and
         technocentric values with economic development, habitat restoration, economic
         value of natural goods and services, gene banks etc
      • examples of tropical biomes e.g. tropical forests, grasslands, savannas, lakes
         & rivers, coral reefs etc and environmental value systems eg ecocentrism,
         anthropocentrism, technocentrism, etc and habitat/species protection strategies
         eg reserves, managed sustainable harvesting, ecotourism, fishing quotas, etc
         and value systems in specific tropical societies eg rights of nature enshrined in
         constitutions of Ecuador/Bolivia, human rights to a healthy environment in laws
         of Costa Rica/Brazil, etc
      • balanced analysis of the ways in which different value systems are likely to
         impact/influence the protection of tropical biomes, acknowledging relevant
         counter-arguments/alternative viewpoints.
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg “Because ecocentric values embrace the biorights of all
         living species and habitats their implications are bound to be the most
         fundamentally protective, however, to be practical in current society, more is
         likely to be achieved in protecting tropical biomes through some compromise
         with other value systems.” NB This is only an example of a possible conclusion.
         Candidates’ conclusions do not have to agree.

6.   (a)   Outline the reasons why natural capital has a dynamic nature.                            [4 max]

           the value and status of natural capital may vary regionally;
           eg cork may be highly valued in areas where grapes for wine are grown;
           the value may also vary over time;
           eg cork has been used for millennia as bottle stoppers for wine and other products
           but in the last 20 years its value has decreased as other resources have been
           used to seal wine bottles;
           the value may vary due to other reasons, eg social/political;
           eg uranium’s value decreased quickly after the Fukushima nuclear disaster when
           public pressure led to several countries declaring they would phase out nuclear
           power;
           the value may vary due to environmental/technological reasons;
           eg lithium’s value has increased as it is used to make batteries for electric cars and
           personal devices;

           Award [1] for each correct reason and/or example, up to [4 max]. N.B. Credit may
           be allowed for alternative egs of equivalent validity, detail and relevance.

     (b)   Explain how the inequitable distribution of natural resources can lead to conflict.      [7 max]

           natural resources like water/food/productive land/fossil fuel/ore deposits are distributed
           unequally around the globe/some countries have a lot, some others have few;
           eg sub-Saharan African countries face water shortages/Middle East countries have a huge
           surplus of oil;
           which may lead one country to invade another for its resources eg ore deposits in
           Congo/Afghanistan;
           inequitabilities may also arise from changes within societies due to
           overconsumption/population growth/lack of technology
           (agricultural/extraction/mining)/unsustainable development;
           …or from changes in their surroundings eg climatic change/international
           politics/economics/war/embargoes;
           eg food price crisis in 2008 causing protests/riots/political/economic/social unrest (in both
           LEDCs & MEDCs);
           eg water scarcity due to climate change in Syria is argued to be a major cause of civil war
           in 2011;
           Inequitability often leads to conflict when a resource is shared across national borders
           (usually water storages or oil deposits);
           eg sharing the Nile’s water resources between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt;
           inequitability in energy/fuel reserves is particularly significant to economics/national
           security;
           eg leading to, and promulgating many conflicts in the Middle East;
           conflicts can also occur between constituencies within a country eg social classes/ethnic
           groups/resentments over government regulations/bans/taxation/private ownerships v public;
           eg when cost of clean water is prohibitive for lower social classes;

           Award 1 mark for any argument/valid eg connecting unequal resource distribution to
           conflict;
           Allow 4 max for outlining inequality in resource distribution without clear reference on how it
           is leading to conflict.

(c)   The management of a resource can impact the production of solid domestic waste.

      To what extent have the three levels of the pollution management model been
      successfully applied to the management of solid domestic waste?                     [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
      the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of pollution management model
         and its “three levels” ie A. altering human activity/reducing production, B.
         regulating/limiting release, C. clean-up/restoration, economic
         incentives/disincentives, legislation, emission standards, pollutant extraction,
         habitat restoration, solid domestic waste, e-waste, hazardous waste,
         reduce/reuse/recycle, landfills, incineration, composting, biodegradable/non-
         biodegradable, zero-waste, waste to energy, etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking different levels with each other and with
         relevant management strategies to each ie A. educational
         campaigns/legislation for reduced packaging/non-biodegradable products,
         product longevity, etc and B. promotion of reuse/recycling, composting,
         landfills, incineration, waste to energy schemes, etc and C. landfill reclamation,
         litter collection, bioremediation, detoxification of hazardous waste, restocking,
         etc
      • examples of specific schemes eg A. tax on plastic bags/waste collection (eg
         Germany/Rwanda), San Francisco zero waste by 2020, rewards for low-waste
         manufacturing, B. government waste to energy schemes, sponsored recycling
         schemes, C. mining landfills to remove hazardous waste (e.g. Switzerland),
         clean-up schemes for Pacific Garbage Patch, etc
      • balanced analysis of the success or otherwise i.e. relative strengths &
         weaknesses of a range of strategies from all three levels of the pollution
         management model acknowledging relevant counterarguments/alternative
         viewpoints.
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg “Logically, it must be most effective to manage waste at
         the first level which prevents problems arising but, due to the inevitable inertia
         in changing people’s perceptions, values and activities, more is currently being
         successfully achieved through the next two levels.” NB This is only an example
         of a possible conclusion. Candidates’ conclusions do not have to agree.

7.   (a)   Outline how soil can be viewed as an ecosystem.                                     [4 max]

           Like an ecosystem, soil is an open system with inputs and outputs;
           (inputs of) eg water/O2 (and outputs of) eg CO2/nitrogen;
           ...and storages and flows/processes;
           (storages of) eg nitrates/water (and flows of) eg leaching/decomposition;
           like an ecosystem, soil is a community of living/biotic and abiotic elements;
           (biotic) eg bacteria/fungi/earthworms (and abiotic) eg clay/sand/silt/water/heat;
           ...with the many complex interactions/interrelationships/eg mineral
           cycling/leguminous plants;
           interacts with/supports other systems/eg vegetation growth, animal
           movement/burrowing/human development;

           Award marks as above for identifying relevant common features, and also for
           giving examples (provided it is clear what is being exemplified).

     (b)   Compare and contrast the impact of humans on the carbon and nitrogen cycles.        [7 max]

           in both cycles combustion (of forests/fossil fuels) increases concentration of oxides
           in atmosphere;
           in both cycles deforestation/agriculture/SDW lead to decomposition that also
           releases oxides;
           ...but carbon dioxide released (by respiration) into atmosphere/(whereas) nitrous
           oxides are released into soil water (by nitrification);
           both oxides will increase impact of global warming/climate change;
           ...but NOx to a smaller degree;
           both oxides result in the acidification of water/aquatic bodies;
           ...but only NOx may cause acid deposition/acidify soils;
           deforestation removes organic storages of both N and C (stored in plant biomass);
           …and reduces absorption of C from atmosphere (via photosynthesis) (but not N);
           …causes soil erosion which reduces inorganic N storages in soil (but not C);
           use of inorganic fertilisers increases N in soil (but not C);
           …and run-off may cause excessive inorganic N in aquatic systems (but not C);
           pesticide/herbicide use in agriculture might kill organisms thus reducing both C and
           N organic storages (stored in their biomass);
           … thus reducing nitrification/denitrification/decomposition process/(whereas) effect
           on C cycle is limited to reducing respiration by soil animals;
           extraction of oil/coal/gas reduces underground (ancient) C storages/transfers C storages on
           surface (for human use)/(whereas) effect to N cycle is limited to a few organic
           compounds/aromatics found in oil;

           Award 5 max if only similarities or only differences are identified.

      Answers may include:

      •   understanding concepts and terminology of steady state and dynamic
          equilibria, stability, resilience, tipping-points, diversity, storage size,
          productivity, negative/positive feedback, complexity, community
          interdependence/interaction, human impacts of overexploitation/unsustainable
          harvesting, pollution, habitat degradation/destruction, unsustainable
          development, etc
      •   breadth in addressing and linking factors that provide stability/resilience eg
          storage size, diversity, productivity, complexity, etc with human activities that
          either weaken/reduce them eg overfishing, intensive agriculture, C
          emissions/global warming, water/atmospheric pollution, deforestation,
          urbanisation, mining/resource extraction, etc or activities that
          strengthen/protect them eg legislation setting pollution limits/standards/fishing
          quotas, sustainable development schemes, alternative/renewable energies,
          conservation efforts/reserves, etc
      •   examples of specific negative impacts on stability of ecological systems e.g.
          overfishing reduces the storage size of targeted fish populations reducing their
          stability, C emissions lead to climate change that reduces primary productivity
          of systems, eutrophication will interfere with negative feedback loops in
          freshwater systems, atmospheric pollutants may eliminate sensitive species of
          lichen reducing diversity, etc and positive impacts on stability e.g. in-situ
          conservation protects complexity of relationships in system, agricultural
          techniques conserving soils maintain high productivity, etc
      •   balanced analysis of the extent to which human activities promote or prevent
          destabilisation of ecological systems with acknowledgement of relevant
          counter-arguments/alternative viewpoints.
      •   a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
          examples given eg “The role of humans in destabilising ecological systems is
          very diverse, and with the current size and growth of population, the magnitude
          of that role is becoming immense, calling for urgent and wide-scale efforts to
          adopt a proactive role in re-stabilising those systems.” NB This is only an
          example of a possible conclusion. Candidates’ conclusions do not have to
          agree. Their value should be assessed simply according to the criteria given in
          the markband descriptors.
