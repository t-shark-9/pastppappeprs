11.   An application package used in an office includes a word processor.  A secretary uses the
      word processor to create a text file.

      (a)   Describe how a spellchecker checks whether a word in a text file is correctly spelt
            or not.                                                                                  [2]

      (b)   State one advantage of this feature.                                                     [1]

      (c)   Identify two additional features of a word processing package that could be useful for
            this office.                                                                             [2]

      (d)   Outline the purpose of one application software package other than a word processing
            package that could be used in this office.                                               [2]

12.   A wireless local area network (WLAN) is used to extend access to a school’s wired
      local area network.

      (a)   Identify one hardware component of the WLAN, other than computers.                           [1]

      The advantages of this WLAN are user-mobility and economical access points.

      (b)   Outline two disadvantages of this WLAN.                                                      [4]

      (c)   Identify three ways in which the network administrator can reduce the risk of unauthorized
            access to confidential data.                                                                 [3]

      The concept of packet data transmission is used within this network.

      (e)   With reference to Figure 1, explain how data is transferred by packet switching.             [6]




                                                                                                 Turn over
                                                    –6–                   N17/4/COMSC/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

13.   A character array S holds the word “PSEUDOCODE”.

                               [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
                                P S E U D O C O D E


      (a)   State the index of character “U” in the array S.                                               [1]

      (b)   Consider the following algorithm. The function len() returns the number of characters
            in an array (for example, len(S) is 10).

		 K = 0
		 CL = 0
		 loop while K < len(S)
			 if S[K] = "E" then
				 CL = CL + 1
			  end if
			 K = K + 1
		end loop
		output CL

		          For this algorithm, copy and complete the following trace table.                               [4]

                 K                CL         K < len(S)        S[K] = "E"         output
                 0                 0            TRUE              FALSE              …
                 …                 …              …                 …                …


      A simple method of encoding a message is to use substitutions to produce a cryptogram.

      Given a positive integer N and the array UPCASELETTERS containing letters in alphabetical
      order, a new array SUBSTITUTE is created by shifting the entire contents of UPCASELETTERS
      to the left, N times.  As an element moves off the left of the array, it moves back into the right
      side of the array.

      For example, given the array UPCASELETTERS:

[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]
 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

      When N = 5 the array SUBSTITUTE will be:

[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]
 F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C D E

      (c)   Construct an algorithm which creates the array SUBSTITUTE. You may assume that a
            positive integer N and array UPCASELETTERS are given.                                          [5]




(This question continues on the following page)
                                                 –7–                  N17/4/COMSC/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

(Question 13 continued)

     This encoding method produces a cryptogram of a sentence by replacing each uppercase
     letter of the sentence with its substitute. Other characters in the sentence are not changed.

     For example, using the arrays shown on page 6:

		         Input (sentence):      ARS LONGA, VITA BREVIS.
		         Output (cryptogram):   FWX QTSLF, ANYF GWJANX.

     The following algorithm fragment inputs the characters, one by one, from the input sentence,
     and outputs its cryptogram using the method encode().

  loop while NOT end-of-input-sentence
		     CH = input()
		     CRYPTEDCH= encode(CH, UPCASELETTERS, SUBSTITUTE)
		output CRYPTEDCH
  end loop

     The method encode() accepts a character CH and two arrays UPCASELETTERS and
     SUBSTITUTE, as defined above, and returns the corresponding character CRYPTEDCH of the
     character CH.

     (d)   Explain the steps to construct an algorithm for the method encode().                      [5]
