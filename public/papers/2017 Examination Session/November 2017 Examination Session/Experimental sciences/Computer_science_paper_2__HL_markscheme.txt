Option A — Databases

1.   (a)   Award marks as follow up to [2 max].
           Award [1] for: a unit of work/logical action;
                          performed on a database;
                          independent of other transactions;
                          changes state of the database;

           Example answer 1
           A database transaction is a logical unit that is independently executed;
           For data retrieval or updates;

           Example answer 2
           A database transaction is a unit of work;
           That is either executed in full or not executed at all;

           Example answer 3
           A database transaction is a way of representing a state change;
           And has four properties, known as ACID;

           Example answer 4
           A database transaction usually means a sequence of steps, treated as a unit;
           For the purposes of satisfying a client’s request;

           Example answer 5
           A database transaction is a process carried out on a database;
           Which may change its state, for example: moving money between bank
           accounts;                                                                          [2]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].

           Example answer 1
           Durability is important because transaction data changes must be available;
           Even in the event of database failure;

           Example answer 2
           Durability means that if the system says the transaction has been committed;
           The client does not need to worry about it because transactions that have been
           committed will survive permanently;

           Example answer 3
           Durability in databases is an important property because it ensures transactions
           are saved permanently;
           And do not accidentally disappear or get erased;                                   [2]

     (c)   Award up to [2 max].
           One to one;
           One to many;
           Many to one;
           Many to many;                                                                      [2]
                                             –4–                N17/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Award [1] for stating what a data dictionary is and up to [3 max] for describing its
      contents.

      It is a set of tables/a database that provides information/meta-data about the
      database;

      A data dictionary contains
      The definitions of records/entities in the database;
      How much space has been allocated for and is currently used;
      Default values for columns/attributes;
      Integrity constraint information;
      Names of (database) users, their privileges and roles;
      Auditing information such as who has accessed or updated data records;
      etc (any other general database information);

      They do not contain any actual data from the database, it contains only
      information for managing it (without a data dictionary a DBMS cannot access
      data from the database);
      Data dictionaries are usually hidden from users to prevent them from
      (accidentally) deleting/changing/destroying its contents;                              [4]

(e)   Award up to [4 max].
      To direct and perform all activities related to a database system;
      Installing and configuring software;
      Creating new databases;
      Designing the database schema and creating any necessary database objects;
      Ensure database security is implemented to safeguard the data;
      Back up and recover the database;
      Work closely with application developers and system administrators to ensure all
      database needs are being met;
      Apply patches or upgrades to the database as needed;
      Training employees who use the database;                                               [4]

2.   (a)   Award [1] for stating what data is.
           Award [1] for stating what information is.
           Award [1] for stating the difference using an example.

           Example answer 1
           Data is a raw fact, for example, “Joe Skrin” is data/a string;
           Whilst information is data which has meaning;
           In this table “Joe Skrin” is the name of an art student/who had an examination/
           who passed an examination;

           Example answer 2
           For example, number 99 is data;
           In this database, total 99 is information;
           Because it has meaning, it represents a student’s mark/it shows that the student
           failed;                                                                                 [3]

     (b)   (i)    An entity is some unit of data that can be classified and has stated
                  relationships to other data units;
                  A real-world object with attributes that is represented as data in a database;   [1]

           (ii)   In relation to given example, the entity is a single student about whom data
                  can be stored as a record in this relation;                                      [1]

     (c)   String/varchar/char/alphanumeric;                                                       [1]

     (d)   Award up to [4 max]. Award [1] for stating the purpose of data verification and
           [1] for further explanation, up to [2 max]. Award [1] for stating the purpose of
           data verification and [1] for further explanation, up to [2 max].

           Data verification is a process that ensures the accuracy of data;
           (Accurate data is important because strategies devised based on incorrect data
           lead to inconsistent decision making;)
           Data verification is conducted using proofreading/double entry checks/new data
           cleansing software and technologies have been developed to automate the data
           verification process;

           Data validation ensures the data is logical and reasonable;
           Data validation is a computer-generated process using codes to validate a range
           of data;

           Data verification and data validation (applied in combination) provide quality
           assurance/make sure that processes and strategies are not driven in the wrong
           direction;                                                                              [4]

(e)   Award up to [2 max].

      Example answer 1 (assuming the value of the Total is calculated)
      The calculated value for the total mark must be an integer;
      In the range from 0 to 300;
      (If it is not, an error message could be output;)

      Example answer 2 (assuming the value of the Total is entered)
      The entered value for the total mark must be an integer;
      In the range from 0 to 300;
      The sum of marks on the three exams can be calculated and should be equal to
      the entered value for Total;
      (If it is not, an error message could be output;)                                       [2]

      Example answer 3
      Total is a validated field;
      Therefore, if all the individual test fields are validated, the Total value will
      automatically be within the specified range;

(f)   (i)    Award [1] for selecting the correct field from the table and [1] for a correct
             comparison, up to [2 max].

             SELECT Student_Name FROM Class_Table
             WHERE Exam_Two == 100                                                            [2]

             Note: Accept logically equivalent answers.

      (ii)   Award marks as follows up to [4 max].
             Award [1] for selecting the correct field from the table.
             Award [1] for each of the correct comparisons, up to [4 max].
             Award [1] for using logical operators correctly.

             Example answer 1
             SELECT Student_ID FROM Class_Table
             WHERE Exam_One >= 30 and Exam_Two >= 30 and
               Exam_Three >= 30 and Total >= 150

             Example answer 2
             SELECT Student_ID FROM Class_Table
             WHERE not (Exam_One < 30 or Exam_Two < 30 or
               Exam_Three < 30 or Total < 150)                                                [4]

             Note: Accept logically equivalent answers.

3.   (a)   (i)    Award [1 max].
                  Redundant data means data that is held in two different places within a
                  database;                                                                       [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for identifying an issue caused by data redundancy and [1] for a
                  brief explanation up to [2 max].

                  It could give the system unwanted/unexpected results;
                  due to the use of inaccurate data;

                  It may lead to additional storage requirements;
                  As data is used more times than necessary;                                      [2]

     (b)   Award up to [3 max].
           Each attribute has a single value/is atomic;
           All values for a given attribute are of the same data type;
           Each attribute is unique;
           This is a unique key;
           There are no repeating fields;
           There are no two identical tuples in this relation;
           Order of attributes/tuples is not significant for the relation;
           Key (Date + Code) is unique for each tuple;                                            [3]

     (c)   Award [1] for identifying why a compound key is used for the
           SCHOOL_VOLUNTEERS relation and [1] for a brief explanation up to [2 max].

           The alternative is to use an autonumber field;
           But this would use additional storage space;

           Are used because it is not possible to designate a primary key from a single field;
           Neither the code nor the date field on their own uniquely identify a record;
           Is based on two primary keys in other tables;                                          [2]

     (d)   Award up to [5 max].

           Example answer 1
           2NF = 3NF if there are no transitive relationships/if any non-key attributes are
           more dependent on another non-key attribute than the key field;
           Schools_Table could be the above if a school had more than 1 address;
           Then the Address would depend upon the School_Name;
           And the Schools_Table code would be split as follows:
           (Code, School_Name)
           (School_Name, Address);
           If the school had only 1 address then 2NF = 3NF;
           The Volunteers_Table has no transitive dependencies;
           There is no redundant data;

           Example answer 2
           A relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and it contains no transitive dependencies;

           Assuming that schools name is not unchangeable;
           OR there are two schools with different names and same addresses;
           OR two schools with same name and different addresses;
           Then the school name cannot be treated as a key;
                                                 –8–                N17/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           From the 2NF (two created relations above) the functional dependencies are not
           evident in the relation School_Table (School_Name, Code, Address):

           The relation given above (in 2NF) is also in 3NF;
           School_Table (School_Name, Code, Address)
           Volunteers_Table (Code, Date, Num_Volunteers)                                         [5]


4.   (a)   Award up to [4 max].
           Object-oriented databases store objects rather than data such as integers, strings
           or real numbers;
           Objects are used in object-oriented languages such as C++, Java, and others;
           Objects consist of attributes (data which defines the characteristics of an object)
           and methods (procedures or functions which define the behaviour of an object) /
           the data is closely related to the programs that process them;
           Which may be a more accurate representation of the real-world objects they
           represent;

           Relational databases store data such as integers, strings or real numbers in
           tables / uses tables with rows and columns);
           Relational database is normalized so data is not repeated more often than
           necessary;
           All columns depend on a primary key (a unique value in the column) to identify
           the column;
           Once the specific column is identified, data from one or more rows associated
           with that column may be obtained or changed;
           There is a distinct separation between the storage of data and any application
           using them;

           Disadvantages of object-oriented database over relational database
           Lower efficiency when data is simple and relationships are simple;
           Relational tables are simpler;
           More user tools exist for relational databases;
           Standards and support for relational databases are more stable so changes in
           database are less likely to be required;                                              [4]

     (b)   Award [2 max]
           A spatial database stores:
           Spatial data / locational data / geometric data types;
           Such as point, polygons, lines, 3D shapes, coordinates etc; // allow any one of
           these;
           That model the structure of geometric/3D objects;
           And make use of spatial indexes to access data;
           And supports geometric functions;                                                     [2]

(c)   (i)    Database segmentation means dividing entities into groups with similar
             characteristics/common attributes;                                             [1]

      (ii)   Award [1] for identifying a benefit and [1] for a further explanation,
             up to [2 max].

             Benefit
             Increased profit;
             Better reputation;
             Increased number of customers;
             Better opportunities for growth;
             To gain a larger share of the market;

             Explanation
             By studying the groups and behaviour of the customers in the group (for
             example, average call time of customers younger than 30 or which services
             are purchased by customers older than 60, etc);
             The company will better understand customers and serve them better;
             Can better decide which marketing actions should be taken;
             Can better predict which group of customers new products/services should
             be offered to;
             Can better decide which new products/services are needed;                      [2]

(d)   Award up to [3 max].
      Useful data should be discovered then extracted from various sources;
      Transformations performed;
      Repair inaccuracy between data formats;
      Remove mistakes/spelling mistakes;
      Delete unnecessary data/data fields / clean up the data;
      (accept other examples)
      Load data into data warehouse;                                                        [3]

      Association is a (rule based) data mining technique which searches for
      relationships between data items;
      In the same transaction;
      Sequential patterns is a technique that seeks to discover/identify similar patterns
      in transaction data;
      Over a period of time;

      Note: Accept examples in given situation.
      Association could find out that customers who buy a new mobile phone also
      change the subscription type;
      Sequential patterns could discover that twice a year number and duration of calls
      increase (eg, customers’ birthday and New Year’s Eve);                                [3]

(f)   Award [1] for creating a model and [1] for detecting changes/differences in the
      data/model from previously measured values, up to [2 max].

      Example answer
      The customer call records and calling behaviour (other activities) could be
      summarized to obtain their calling pattern;
      The (previous) calling pattern could be compared with the customers’ recent
      call/activity;
      In case of significant changes/differences the activity is suspicious/fraud
      detected;                                                                             [2]

(g)   Award [1] for creating a statistical model, [1] for analysing the model and
      forecasting probabilities/trends and [1] for an appropriate example in the given
      situation.

      Example answer 1
      Customer’s online behaviour pattern could be created and considered;
      Customers who spend less time logged on may be less likely to renew their
      annual subscription;
      In this case, the ability to keep the customer can be increased by offering
      new/better/cheaper services and products;

      Example answer 2
      Customer’s calling pattern could be created and analysed;
      If, for example, the customer has high monthly usage of services then the
      customer will probably renew his annual subscription;
      (No actions made by the company needed);

      If a customer is younger than 20, may spend more time exploring new service
      features, and the customer is at a greater risk to cancel the contract/the customer

           good expansion of this point.

           Investigate past weather patterns in order to see if past forecasts were correct or
           not and make adjustments to your model appropriately;
           Look at specific events in the past (eg appearance of El Nino) to see how they
           affected future weather patterns in different areas, and then apply this to new
           occurrences of these events;
           However, historical data does not take into account new factors, such as how
           carbon emissions are contributing to global warming;                                  [5]

9.   Award marks as follows up to [5 max].
     Award [2 max] for an outline of how the statistical/probabilistic approach works (award
     [1] for a less complete response).
     Award [2] for an outline of how the rule-based/cognitive approach works (award [1] for
     a less complete response).
     Award [1] for a reasonable conclusion that explains why the former approach is
     chosen.

     Example answer
     The statistical model involves comparing the text to be translated against previously
     stored sets of text pairs (eg English and its French equivalent) and then selecting the
     most probable translation;
     The cognitive model involves establishing all the rules of each of the languages and
     then breaking down each section of text to establish its grammatical structure and then
     replacing the text with text that has an equivalent structure from the other language;
     The second approach has not proved particularly successful for two reasons. The first
     is that the process of establishing a clear set of rules is extremely labour intensive.
     The second is that the process can be ruined by the problems of context, double
     meanings and non-standard language;
     The first approach was taken because the company has stored an enormous set of
     validated text in different languages and the increase in processing power which allows
     this corpus to be searched and processed;                                                 [5]

            Mark-up language;
            Can contain scripting commands/code;
            Can imbed objects;
            Uses tags to structure page;
            Provides constructs to build hyperlinks;
            Can be integrated with CSS and JavaScript;
            Note: Accept other reasonable characteristics.                                        [2]

      (b)   Award marks as follows up to [6 max].
            Award [1] for identifying an advantage, [1] for identifying a disadvantage, and a
            further [4 max] for expanding on these advantages/disadvantages.

            Advantages
            It saves time (in web development);
            Because modification of style needs to only be made to the CSS;
            It saves space;
            Because the code (of the style) is not repeated in each HTML file;
            Quicker load of many pages / Quicker download of many pages from the same
            site;
            HTML files are smaller;
            It gives a uniform appearance to the entire website;
            Which makes it more attractive/appealing/easy to navigate;
            It can be integrated with outside sources (eg RSS feeds);
            Which makes the website more interactive/dynamic for the user;
            Quicker to make changes to layout/formatting/page positioning;
            Therefore, it helps separating the jobs/tasks of illustrators (designer) from those
            that produce content;
            Increases accessibility of authoring to non-experts;
            Supported by most browsers;
            Increasing the number of users;

            Disadvantages:
            Downloading pages from different sites can be slow (general browsing);
            Because each page may have its own CSS;
            (However, downloading many pages from the same site is instead faster;)
            CSS syntax is different from HTML and can be slightly ambiguous;
            Not a user-friendly language (but available as IDE) that the developer needs to
            learn;
            (eg the same cascade style name may have slightly different effects when used
            by different browsers;)
            An HTML page saved without CSS, and seen offline, will not display nicely;
            Because it would require access to external files, including CSS (including
            images, video, sound);
            Anybody with read/write permission to the CSS can easily override just the CSS;
            Showing unwanted information to an entire web-site (risk of hacking in just one
            point/internal threat with high risk);
            Some browsers do not support exactly the same CSS (some styles/fonts for
            example);
            The view can be slightly different using different browsers/risk of slight
            incompatibility;
            (For large, corporate sites) Integration of HTML + CSS with other content
            management systems (CMS) may be tricky;
            Because CMS also use their own CSS, and there can be collisions, and it
            requires technical competence;                                                        [6]

      (c)   Award up to [3 max].
            (When a request of download is received at the Application level (eg HTTP with a
            browser), appropriate data packets are generated and sent to the transport
            layer/TCP;)

            TCP uses the header of the data packets to order them and to check their
            contents;
            And sends an acknowledgement signal to the transmitter upon correct
            reception, before preparing a new data packet with a further header for the
            IP/Internet level;
            If the transmitter does not receive the acknowledgement from the TCP, the
            transmitter re-sends the packet;
            Therefore, all correct packets will be available to the TCP at some point to be
            made available to the IP and specifically to the IP destination/receiver (in the
            header);
            IP ensures that the package reaches the correct address;                                  [3]

      (d)   Award marks as follows up to [4 max].
            Award [1 max] each for outlining the two techniques (lossy and lossless).
            Award [up to 2 max] for relating both to actual applications ([1] if related to file
            types instead).

            Images and audio can be compressed using lossy techniques;
            This will create a smaller file/faster transmission time;
            But the data loss will not seriously affect quality;

            However, CSS and HTML files might lose possible scripting;
            As you need to recover the original data;
            Lossless compression is more suitable;                                                    [4]



11.   (a)   Award up to [4].
            Server-side scripting does not require the installation of extra resources on a
            computer, for example the latest plug-in to run the script;
            The log-in process will generally be slower as a round trip has to be made;
            However, for regular visitors of the site, it speeds up the login, as the server script
            might be linked to data storage and recognize their access for further reference;
            The server script is independent from the version of the browsers that is used,
            the user just sees the HTML interface (this is the typical problem with client-side
            scripting);
            A security breach on the server could lead to all log-ins being compromised;
            However, server-side is more secure as client-side is more easily hacked into;
            There can be occasional downgrade in performance if too many users are
            running simultaneously their scripts on the server;
            However, for the nature of the files, this should not generate bottlenecks in the
            network (small files, not intensive streaming);                                           [4]

(b)   Award up to [4 max].
      Your email address and associated password are private;
      Both are needed to register with the initial website, but at most only the email
      address is stored there;
      They are forwarded to the third-party website for identification;
      The third-party identifies/confirms whether or not the person is who they say they
      are, based on their email/social network services that the third party provides;
      This yes–no answer/confirmation provides the authentication for the open-source
      developers;                                                                           [4]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for stating how the URL is generated, and [1] for giving an
             example, up to [2 max].

             It is generated by taking the path of the website extended with the path for
             the code;
             eg www.OpenSourceDev.org/newcode/json/fakecode007;                             [2]

      (ii)   The script accesses the file of new URLs (in a file);
             And adds the URLs to an email template;
             Then accesses the file of email addresses of subscribers (and sends
             email);                                                                        [3]

(d)   Award marks as follows, up to [3 max]. (Note: there are [5] marking points)
      Award [1] for the value passing from the form to php via POST.
      Award [1] for the operation of the code to generate the short URL with final $v.
      Award [1] for access to update database.
      Award [1] for a new correct triple in database.
      Award [1] for remote access operated by server through the database to retrieve
      the URL.
      Note: Competent use of terminology is needed to award full marks. Generic
      answers that show general good understanding of the process, but lack use of
      competent language should not be awarded full marks.

      Example
      The value of the URL that is inputted (and submitted) via the form is stored in the
      variable URL which Interacts with the php code, because the method POST is
      specified in the form, therefore starting a communication process;

      The process generates a different value for the name for the URL that is used to
      update a database of URLs together with the IP address;

      The IP address is retrieved by the server through a remote call requested from
      the insertion in database;

      The new value for the URL that is generated, given the one in input, is
      thenhpid.td and is stored in $v;
           (detail of intermediate operations:
           $x = thendorgbinphpid
           $y = thenhpid
           $z = td
           $v = thenhpid.td)

      The new record inserted in the database url_db will be the following triple
      www.the2nd.org/bin.php?id=70, thenhpid.td, 172.16.254.1;                              [3]

            Source code edited directly in HTML generally shorter/less cumbersome than the
            one developed with web applications;                                                    [3]

      (b)   Award [1] for identifying a service and [1] for stating a benefit, for two services
            up to [4 max].

            Book/pre-pay online for tickets;
            More convenient for visitors (avoids closures/queues etc);

            Add a virtual tour of the museum online;
            Increases the visibility of the museum / It becomes better known;

            Add an audio-guide for smartphone to be downloaded from the portal;
            So that users are already equipped before they visit;

            (Targeted) pop up adverts/links;
            Can increase revenue to the museum;                                                     [4]

      (c)   Award up to [4 max].
            More possibility for the users to interact will make the website more popular;
            More services online provides more ways for the museum to be linked from/to
            other external organizations/institutions (eg bank/tourist office);
            The two combined would generate more traffic and more authoritative in-links;
            This increases the possibility for the site to be found in a variety of ways when
            searched;
            And this increases the website’s ranking;                                               [4]

(d)   Award marks as follows up to [3 max].
      Award [1] for an example/idea of a meta-tag and its purpose.
      Award [1] for understanding the link between meta-tags and indexing via the
      search operation by crawlers.
      Award [1] for understanding the link between indexing and ranking via
      optimization/better classification by SEO.

      Use of correct keywords allows the search engine to search and find those terms;

      For Example
      Title tags / keywords associated to the title of the page;
      A description with tags may induce more visitors to visit the page;
      Other keywords that appropriately refer to the content of the web;
      (Even irrelevant keywords or hidden content however keyword stuffing might
      actually be punished by more recent algorithms for ranking);
      Meta attributes for robots (such as follow/nofollow, index/noindex) that give
      indication about whether or not to index the page;
      Meta language descriptors (for example to recognize in some language rather
      than English) to appropriately index content based on the dictionary of that
      language;
      This is related to indexing, because web crawlers visit pages and inspect their
      content based on the terms that they have to search;
      The ranking algorithms give value to the pages once that they are indexed, based
      on parameters that depend also on the ease of retrieving the pages/number of
      authoritative in-links/number of hits (or visitors);
      The Search Engine can be optimized so that the best use of meta-tags can be
      made with the objective of indexing and ultimately ranking;                        [3]

            4 has changed its URL;
            4 has removed itself from the internet;                                               [2]

      (e)   4                                                                                     [1]

      (f)   Award marks as follows up to [5 max].
            Award up to [1] for showing understanding of what a power law is, [2] for
            addressing both ideas of incremental web and preferential connectivity (award
            only [1] if one is addressed), and [2] for discussing them in context AND
            mentioning some element of the web graph.

            (Incrementality of web): Number of nodes in the web increases (nodes are not
            deleted) / New nodes (documents) have hyperlinks that connect to existing nodes
            in the web;

            (preferential connectivity): This connectivity happens following some preferential
            element/affinity/alikeness (eg common theme) and over time it induces an
            aggregation of nodes;

            (Incrementality and preferential connectivity): Have the consequence that the
            SCC grows;

            (Nodes are not deleted, but) some of the hyperlinks in documents may be
            changed/deleted/break over time, this may produce isolated nodes;

            (Power law – proportionality): Relates two quantities, x and y, when y is
            proportional to x^c, for some constant c;

            The probability for a new document N to be connected to some document M
            (with a certain out-degree) is proportional/depends on the probability that the
            hyperlinks in N to connect to M (ie the sum of the out-degrees of the nodes
            reached from N, recursively);

            Therefore, a few nodes receive many in-links (because many nodes link to them
            directly or indirectly based on preference), whereas nodes that have a few
            in-links are probably new;

            Niche themes/new themes with new language/obsolete themes (when theme is a
            preference) typically bypass the SCC, making tendrils and tubes;                      [5]

      (b)   Award marks as follows up to [4 max].
            Award up to [2 max] for describing how the smartphones/WiFi could be used for
            street illumination.
            Award up to [2 max] for a discussion on privacy/monitoring based on the
            data/algorithms used.

            For example

            How smartphones/WiFi is used in the scenario
            Hot-spot traffic may provide an indication of how large the crowd moving in the
            street/zone is;
            Hopping from one connection to another may provide an indication of how and
            where the crowd may move;
            Therefore, this data may contribute to optimize the algorithm, which in turn could
            impact on the cost of public illumination, so it is an advantage for the collectivity;

            Discussion on privacy/monitoring
            Data on hotspots are provided by telecom companies;
            These data should already be the result of some analysis and be stripped of any
            private (personal) information;

            However, the company that controls the illumination would still have information
            on where the crowd is (in addition to the telecom) and this poses an issue of
            crowd monitoring;

            Worse, hotspots integrated directly on lampposts would provide a very
            fine-grained anchoring net, and presence/movement of individuals rather than
            crowds could be monitored (not their private information, necessarily);

            In both cases, private data shall not be made available and authorities and
            protocols should be used to guarantee which level of service these ubiquitous
            solutions provide;

            Governments may obtain this information to track the whereabouts of individuals;         [4]

Option D — Object-orientated programming

15.   (a)   Award [1] for identifying the code and [1] for identifying the new position.
            private int fiCount = 0 and private int diCount = 0;
            In the variable/attribute section of the class and not in the constructor);          [2]

      (b)   EITHER
            The values of these (static) variables;
            Are the same for all objects;
            They belong to the class (not to the objects);
            And are only created/declared once;
            Note: Do not accept “cannot be changed”.

            OR
            The static methods;
            Are class methods (not object methods);
            Are independent of the objects in the class;                                         [2]

      (c)   Award [2 × 2] for each clear example. Only award [2] for an example if the
            benefit is clearly shown;

            Having different data types allow different operations to be carried out depending
            upon the type;
            eg
            Calculations in the integer “quantity” variable;
            which are not possible for a String;

            Double instead of integer allows the use of decimals;
            which mirrors real-life scenarios/allows more precise calculations;

            Using an array (of objects);
            Allows individual items to be accessed/processed more easily;

            Memory usage can be reduced;
            eg “fiCount” takes up less space as an integer than it would as a double
            (assuming it’s just a number);                                                       [4]

      (d)   The variable fi is declared as an array of FoodItem objects / of type FoodItem;
            With (a maximum of) 100 values;
            It cannot be directly accessed/it is encapsulated within the Payment class;          [3]

      (b)   Award [1] for identifying a feature, [1] for an example in the given context, and [1]
            for an elaboration, for two features up to [6 max].
            Encapsulation places all attributes and methods that relate to a particular
            object/entity together;
            For example, Payment class includes attributes such as the food and drink arrays
            and methods such as calculateBill();
            This provides a clearer view/understanding of each section of the problem;
            Which can lead to more efficient programming (faster, less errors etc);

            Encapsulation protects the values of the data stored within the object;
            From (accidental) changes made by other classes;
            For example, quantity in the FoodItem class cannot be altered through another
            variable called quantity in another class;
            This allows programmers to select any variable names they wish/no restriction on
            choice of variable names;                                                               [6]

      (c)   Award up to [4 max].
            A generic Payment class can be created;
            This would contain data/variables/methods required by all units of the company;
            Each of the different operations could then inherit this class;
            Adding new variables/methods that relate only to them;
            Overriding the superclass methods as necessary;

            Note: Allow a similar answer that deals with the different items (FoodItem,
            DrinkItem etc).                                                                         [4]

            Example 1

            public void changePrice(LinkedList<Item> pll, String c,
                                      double newPrice)
            {
              int i = 0;
              boolean found = false;
              int size = pll.size();
              while (i < size && !found)
              {
                 if (pll.get(i).getCode().equals(c)) // allow “=”
                 {
                   pll.get(i).setPrice(newPrice);
                   found = true;
                 }
                 i = i + 1;
              }
            }

            Example 2

            public void changePrice(LinkedList<Item> pll, String c,
                                      double newPrice)
            {
              Iterator<Item> iter = pll.iterator();
              boolean found = false;
              while (iter.hasNext() && !found)
              {
                 Item current = iter.next();
                 if (current.getCode().equals(c)) // allow “=”
                 {
                   current.setPrice(newPrice);
                   found = true;
                 }
              }
            }                                                                                         [6]
                                                    – 26 –               N17/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      (c)   The pl array/Item objects could be read into a binary tree;
            And placed in order of the item code;
            (Successive) comparisons between the search item and tree item will reduce the
            search space by a half (each time);
            Which results in a faster search than a linear search/Olog(n) is better than
            O(n);
            As a linear search might have to loop through the whole list;                             [4]


19.   (a)   The solution repeats the same algorithm/series of steps/code;
            With a changing/different parameter set;
            Until a base/terminating case is reached;                                                 [3]

            Note: Do not award marks for “the method calls itself”.

      (b)   The base case will return true if the length of word = 0 or 1 (must have both values) /
            The index of last character <= index of the first character;
            Otherwise the first and last letters will be compared;
            Returns false if they are not equal;
            If they are equal, calls the method again;
            With, as its parameter, the word stripped of its first and last letters (can use
            indices);                                                                                 [5]
