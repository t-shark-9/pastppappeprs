Answer all questions.

1.   (a)   Define bioinformatics and give an example of the data used in medical research.             [2]

     (b)   Outline one feature of fuzzy logic which makes it suitable for medical diagnosis.           [2]


2.   (a)   Compare ultrasound and a CT scan in the creation of a medical image.                        [4]

     (b)   Outline two compatibility issues that might be faced with the introduction of Electronic
           health records (EHRs) in a large country.                                                   [4]


3.   With reference to the technology involved, explain how augmented reality imaging could
     be used to assist a surgeon in one country to carry out a complicated operation under the
     supervision of an expert surgeon in another country.                                              [6]


4.   A new health centre is planned in a remote mountain area to serve a community which is
     scattered over a large area. The nearest large hospital with complete medical services is
     difficult to reach.

     The services to be offered in the new health centre should include:

     yy health carers at the health centre for visits made by appointment
     yy expert doctors from other locations, who are available 24 hours a day via
        a VPN connection
     yy a comprehensive care system for chronically sick patients at home
     yy some visiting health workers
     yy some provision for emergency operations in the health centre
     yy diagnostic equipment to identify cases where a person needs to be treated at
        the large hospital.

     The planners are also considering whether to create an internet site with authorized access
     for the community.

     With reference to the technologies involved, discuss ways in which the required services
     could be met and their effect on the people in the community.                                    [12]
