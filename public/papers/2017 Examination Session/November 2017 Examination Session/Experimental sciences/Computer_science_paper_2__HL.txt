		(ii)              Explain one issue that can be caused by redundant data in a database.       [2]

       Consider the following example relation. It holds data about a number of teachers and
       students from different schools who volunteer to support the local community on
       particular days.

     SCHOOL_VOLUNTEERS_TABLE (School_Name, Code, Address, Date, Num_Volunteers)
     School_Name         Code          Address             Date                Num_Volunteers

       The key attributes are underlined.

       (b)   Identify three characteristics of the 1st Normal Form (1NF) which are evident in
             this relation.                                                                     [3]

       (c)   Explain why a compound key is used for the SCHOOL_VOLUNTEERS_TABLE
             relation.                                                                          [2]

       The following shows the normalized SCHOOL_VOLUNTEERS_TABLE relation:

             SCHOOLS_TABLE
             Code, School_Name, Address

             VOLUNTEERS_TABLE
             Code, Date, Num_Volunteers

       (d)   Discuss whether these relations are in third normal form (3NF).                    [5]

4.   A telecommunication company stores a large amount of data in three databases.

 CUSTOMERS                 A relational database which holds personal information such as age,
                           gender, type of telephone, type of subscription, etc.
 DETAILS_OF_CALLS          An object-oriented database which holds data about telephone calls
                           such as call duration, call time, location, where call originated, call
                           received, etc.
 COMPONENTS                A spatial database which holds data about components of the
                           telecommunication network, their location, their status and any error
                           messages generated by these components, etc.

     (a)   Evaluate the use of an object-oriented database as opposed to a relational database.       [4]

     (b)   Define a spatial database.                                                                 [2]

     The database segmentation is carried out on the CUSTOMERS database.

     (c)   (i)   State what is meant by database segmentation.                                        [1]

		(ii)           Explain one benefit of database segmentation to the
                 telecommunication company.                                                           [2]

     Data mining is used to extract knowledge hidden in this large amount of data. Before using
     data mining processes the existing data should be cleaned up.

     (d)   Explain how ETL processes could be used in data preparation.                               [3]

     (e)   Distinguish between the use of association and sequential patterns as data
           mining techniques.                                                                         [3]

     Customers committing fraud is a risk to the company.

     (f)   Describe how deviation detection could be used to detect fraud at the
           telecommunications company.                                                                [2]

     Customers who decide to leave the telecommunication company for a competitor may result
     in huge losses for the telecommunications company.

     (g)   Explain with the use of an example, how predictive modelling could be used to optimize
           information sent to existing customers.                                                    [3]




                                        End of Option A




                                                                                                Turn over
                                                   –6–                  N17/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

Option B — Modelling and simulation

5.   (a)   Distinguish between a computer model and a computer simulation.                              [4]

     (b)   Identify two reasons why some systems are difficult to model successfully.                   [2]

     Computer simulations are often used in situations where practical experimentation is,
     for some reason, not possible. One of these reasons could be an ethical issue.

     (c)   (i)    With clear reference to the ethical issue, describe one example where practical
                  experimentation would not be possible for ethical reasons.                            [3]

		         (ii)   State three other advantages, apart from ethical reasons, of simulating a
                  computer model rather than constructing a physical one.                               [3]


6.   A manufacturing company that produces several products is using spreadsheet software to
     model its finances. This includes calculations that will estimate different quantities including
     the profit that the company will make in future years.

     The model involves the use of spreadsheet software which will be organized using different
     sheets for different areas of the company’s finances. Previously less sophisticated methods
     were used to keep track of costs and sales.

     (a)   By including examples where appropriate, describe a basic structure for this model.          [6]

     (b)   Suggest how the reliability of the model could be tested.                                    [2]

     The company has established certain profit targets that it wishes to achieve over the next
     three years.

     (c)   Explain how this model can be used to investigate different strategies that will reach
           these targets.                                                                               [4]

7.   Weather forecasters use computer models which are able to simulate future weather
     patterns. These forecasts were originally limited to the near future. However, modern
     systems can now produce long range forecasts.

     (a)   Suggest two reasons why these simulations have improved both in their accuracy and
           their range.                                                                               [4]

     (b)   Suggest why forecasts become less accurate the more long range they become.                [4]

     (c)   Discuss whether historical data can be accurately used to forecast future weather.         [5]

     The simulation of the weather forecasting models produces specific data which can be output
     in a variety of ways.

     (d)   (i)    Define the term visualization.                                                      [2]

		         (ii)   With the help of examples, discuss how the development in the way such data
                  is visualized has made the results of these simulations more accessible to the
                  general public.                                                                     [6]

8.   Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are being used in a variety of applications, including pattern
     recognition, game playing, classification and data mining.

     (a)   Explain one reason why ANNs are suitable for solving the types of problems found in
           these areas.                                                                                 [3]

     An ANN is being trained to recognize handwritten numbers by identifying them as a digit
     from 0 to 9.

     (b)   Describe an appropriate set of data that could be used to train the network.                 [2]

     Assume that each digit to be identified is input as an image made up of 30 × 30 pixels.

     (c)   State the number of neurons that would be in

		         (i)    the input layer.                                                                      [1]

		         (ii)   the output layer.                                                                     [1]

     A simplified version of an ANN is shown below.


                          A             D

                                        E
                          B                             H           output
                                        F

                          C             G

     (d)   Explain the way in which the output from neuron D will be determined.                        [3]

     The network is set up with initial values. The outputs are compared with the desired outputs.

     (e)   Identify the steps that now take place to train the network.                                 [5]


9.   Google Translate is an algorithm whose function is to translate text from one language
     to another. One of the resources that it uses is the body of documents produced by the
     United Nations which are routinely translated by humans into various languages.

     Discuss the reasons why Google Translate takes a probabilistic approach in preference to a
     cognitive rule-based approach.                                                                     [5]

Option C — Web science
10.   BuildYourWebSite is an online company that provides a number of common templates for
      building your own website. Each template includes one HTML file, one CSS file, a folder of
      web images, and a folder of special sound effects.

      (a)   Identify two characteristics of HTML.                                                         [2]

      (b)   Discuss the benefits and disadvantages of the template including a CSS file in addition
            to the HTML page.                                                                             [6]

      Each template can be downloaded as a single compressed file, using a web browser.

      (c)   Explain why TCP/IP is a reliable protocol in relation to downloading operations.              [3]

      (d)   Evaluate lossy compression and lossless compression when used to download files.              [4]

11.   Open source code is made available by a community of developers and is frequently
      updated. The code can be downloaded for free, but users must register with the website and
      have their access authenticated.

      (a)   Evaluate the use of server-side scripting to provide the mechanism for registration.          [4]

      Authentication is based on signing in to an established third-party company, for example a

      user, granting them access to the open source code website.

      (b)   Explain how the user's privacy can be maintained whilst using this method of
            authentication.                                                                               [4]

      The URL of this website is www.OpenSourceDev.org. Any new pieces of code that the

12.   A museum has an online catalogue of its pieces. No new pieces have been acquired over
      the past 20 years, and the museum has already been at risk of closure for lack of funding.
      Its website consists only of static web pages.

      It is suggested that the museum’s static web pages may be contributing to the museum’s
      lack of success.

 (a) Identify three differences between a static web page and dynamic web page.                      [3]
		
 (b) Suggest two services, and the benefits that they would provide, if the museum were to
     redesign its website to be dynamic.                                                             [4]

            rankings in search engines.                                                              [4]

      It is also suggested that the museum’s basic catalogue be revised and upgraded with all of
      the museum’s pieces being catalogued using meta-tags.

      (d)   Suggest how the use of meta-tags can be relevant for search engine optimization.         [3]

      (d)   Identify two reasons why an edge may disappear in the new graph, for example the
            edge between node 5 and node 4.                                                           [2]

      We can interpret the graph as follows:
      Each node represents a document and each outgoing arrow represents a hyperlink in
      the document.

      (e)   State how many hyperlinks are in the document corresponding to node 6.                    [1]

      Power laws are often used to model phenomena occurring in very large networks and predict
      their evolution. Power laws may be suitably applied in different cases, in the context of the
      World Wide Web.

      (f)   With reference to the relation between the number of documents in the web and the
            number of hyperlinks in each of them, suggest how power laws may help to explain the
            shape of the World Wide Web.                                                              [5]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A restaurant uses an object-oriented program to manage the cost of the food and drink consumed
by customers. Everytime a table is occupied a Payment object is instantiated which will contain
details of the items ordered. As each item is ordered, a FoodItem or a DrinkItem object is added
to the Payment object as appropriate.
public class Payment
{
  private FoodItem[] fi = new FoodItem[100];
  private int fiCount;
  private static double foodTax = 0.2; // 20 % sales tax added to
										                               // all food prices
  private DrinkItem[] di = new DrinkItem[100];
  private int diCount;
  private static double drinkTax = 0.1; // 10 % sales tax added to
										                               // all drink prices
  public Payment()
  {
    fiCount = 0;
    diCount = 0;
  }

 public DrinkItem getDi(int x)
 {
		return di[x];
 }

    // all other accessor and mutator methods are included

    // addFoodItem() – this method adds a new FoodItem object
    // addDrinkItem() – this method adds a new DrinkItem object

    public static double findPrice(Item[] pl, String c)
    { //code missing }

    // calculateBill() – This method returns the bill (the total value of
    // the items consumed for a particular table)
}

public class FoodItem
{
  private String itemCode;
  private int quantity;

 public FoodItem(String x, int y)
 {
   itemCode = x;
		 quantity = y;
 }

    // all accessor and mutator methods are included
}

The DrinkItem class is defined in a similar way.

15.   Whenever a Payment object is instantiated, the variables fiCount and diCount are
      initialized to 0 through the code in the constructor.
      (a)   Outline an alternative method of initializing these variables that would not require the
            use of the code in the constructor.                                                         [2]

			private FoodItem[] fi = new FoodItem[100];
      The Payment class method addFoodItem() is passed a FoodItem object as a parameter.

16.   The global variable tables is declared as follows:

			Payment[] tables = new Payment[50];

      The indices in this array represent the table number, so tables[1] is a Payment object for
      the customers occupying table number 1.

      The driver (main) class contains the following code. Note: You can assume that all
      appropriate accessor and mutator methods have been included in their respective classes.

      tables[1] = new Payment();
      tables[2] = new Payment();
      FoodItem a = new FoodItem("f102", 2);
      FoodItem b = new FoodItem("f100", 1);
      DrinkItem c = new DrinkItem("d102", 3);

(Option D, question 16 continued)

      The price of each item is stored in an object of the Item class.
      The class is outlined below:

  public class Item
  {
		  private String code;    // item code
		  private String name;    // item name
		  private double price;   // unit price before tax
		 // all accessor, mutator and constructor methods are included
  }

      All of the objects in this class are held in the global array pl according to the following
      declaration: Item[] pl = new Item[200];
      Note: The number of objects held in this array will change from week to week.

      The method findPrice(Item[] pl, String c) in the Payment class looks up and returns
      the price of the item with code c.


      (c)   Construct the method findPrice(). You may assume that the item exists in the array.           [6]

      When a customer wishes to pay the bill, the calculateBill() method is called. If the bill
      was for table 10 then the following call would be made:

		double finalBill = tables[10].calculateBill(Item[] pl);

      (d)   Construct the calculateBill() method. You should make use of any previously
            defined methods.                                                                              [7]


17.   (a)   Construct a diagram showing the relationships between the Payment, FoodItem,
            DrinkItem, and Item classes. You do not need to include the names of attributes
            or methods.                                                                                   [3]

      (b)   By making reference to any of the above classes, describe two benefits that a
            programming team would gain from the use of encapsulation.                                    [6]

      The company that owns this restaurant also owns hotels, shops, and a car hire business.
      The programs that manage the finances of these different businesses include classes similar
      to the ones shown in this paper.

      (c)   Explain how inheritance could be used as a tool to both improve the clarity of the
            design and to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.                             [4]

18.   The programming team have decided to replace the array of Item objects (pl) and the
      array of Payment objects (tables) with either a linked list or an ArrayList.

      (a)   Outline one benefit that the use of either of these choices will have over the original
            array structures.                                                                          [2]

      The array of Item objects (pl) is replaced by priceLL, an object of the LinkedList library
      class. The Item objects can be created, deleted or amended.

      The method changePrice() allows an item, identified by its item code, to have its price
      changed. All data required by this method are passed as parameters. If the item is not found
      then an appropriate message is displayed.

      (b)   Construct the method changePrice().                                                        [6]

      (c)   Explain how a binary tree structure would allow a more efficient search for the
            Item object.                                                                               [4]


19.   A palindrome is a word that spells the same backwards. For example, the words “kayak” and
      “rotor” are palindromes.

      A word can be checked to see if it is a palindrome by comparing the first letter with the last
      letter and then the second letter with the next-to-last letter and so on.

      (a)   Explain why recursion is a suitable tool to use when performing this check.                [3]

      The method palindrome() is called by boolean t = palindrome(word);
      where word is a String variable.

      (b)   Without writing code, describe the recursive method palindrome() that returns
            whether or not a word is a palindrome.                                                     [5]
