       (e)     Identify four responsibilities of a database administrator.                           [4]


2.     A group of art students have taken three examinations in the school year. Each of the three
       examinations has a maximum mark of 100. Each student’s total mark for the year is the sum
       of the marks from the three examinations.

       The students have passed unless their marks meet one or both of the following
       failing conditions:

             yy Scoring less than 30 marks on any one of the three examinations.
             yy Scoring a total mark that is less than 150.

       Consider the following relation created by the teacher of this group of students.

     CLASS_TABLE
     Student_ID        Student_Name         Exam_One          Exam_Two       Exam_Three    Total
     A1209             Ines Prest                 30                 39           30        99
     A1422             Eva Maren                  67                 29          100       196
     C4567             Joe Skrin                 100                 70           42       212
     X0986             Perry Blare                54                 68           30       152
     B0078             Mia Lorres                 26                100          100       226

       (a)     With reference to the relation CLASS_TABLE distinguish between data and
               information.                                                                          [3]

       (b)     (i)    Define the term entity.                                                        [1]

		             (ii)   State the entity for this example relation.                                    [1]

       (c)     Identify an appropriate data type for Student_ID.                                     [1]

       (d)     Explain the role of data validation and data verification.                            [4]

       (e)     Explain how Total could be validated.                                                 [2]

       (f)     Describe the steps in a query that will output

		             (i)    the names of all students who earned the maximum mark on Exam_Two.             [2]

		             (ii)   the Student_IDs of all candidates who passed.                                  [4]

(Option A continued)

3.     (a)   (i)    State what is meant by redundant data in databases.                               [1]

		           (ii)   Explain one issue that can be caused by redundant data in a database.             [2]

       Consider the following example relation. It holds data about a number of teachers and
       students from different schools who volunteer to support the local community on
       particular days.

     SCHOOL_VOLUNTEERS_TABLE (School_Name, Code, Address, Date, Num_Volunteers)
     School_Name         Code          Address             Date                Num_Volunteers
     Riverbank HS        AB1234        Goldmar Dr 15       10/07/2017                 32
     East High           EE1324        East Street 20      10/07/2017                 15
     East High           EE1324        East Street 20      20/10/2017                 19
     Oceanview HS        BG3445        Long Road 123       10/07/2017                 14
     Oceanview HS        BG3445        Long Road 123       20/10/2017                 26
     Blue Sky HS         SB9008        West Street 19      20/10/2017                 37

       The key attributes are underlined.

       (b)   Identify three characteristics of the 1st Normal Form (1NF) which are evident in
             this relation.                                                                           [3]

       (c)   Explain why a compound key is used for the SCHOOL_VOLUNTEERS_TABLE
             relation.                                                                                [2]

       The following shows the normalized SCHOOL_VOLUNTEERS_TABLE relation:

             SCHOOLS_TABLE
             Code, School_Name, Address

             VOLUNTEERS_TABLE
             Code, Date, Num_Volunteers

       (d)   Discuss whether these relations are in third normal form (3NF).                          [5]

                                                                                                Turn over
                                                   –4–                  N17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.   (a)   Distinguish between a computer model and a computer simulation.                              [4]

     (b)   Identify two reasons why some systems are difficult to model successfully.                   [2]

     Computer simulations are often used in situations where practical experimentation is,
     for some reason, not possible. One of these reasons could be an ethical issue.

     (c)   (i)    With clear reference to the ethical issue, describe one example where practical
                  experimentation would not be possible for ethical reasons.                            [3]

		         (ii)   State three other advantages, apart from ethical reasons, of simulating a
                  computer model rather than constructing a physical one.                               [3]


5.   A manufacturing company that produces several products is using spreadsheet software to
     model its finances. This includes calculations that will estimate different quantities including
     the profit that the company will make in future years.

     The model involves the use of spreadsheet software which will be organized using different
     sheets for different areas of the company’s finances. Previously less sophisticated methods
     were used to keep track of costs and sales.

     (a)   By including examples where appropriate, describe a basic structure for this model.          [6]

     (b)   Suggest how the reliability of the model could be tested.                                    [2]

     The company has established certain profit targets that it wishes to achieve over the next
     three years.

     (c)   Explain how this model can be used to investigate different strategies that will reach
           these targets.                                                                               [4]

(Option B continued)
6.   Weather forecasters use computer models which are able to simulate future weather
     patterns. These forecasts were originally limited to the near future. However, modern
     systems can now produce long range forecasts.

     (a)   Suggest two reasons why these simulations have improved both in their accuracy and
           their range.                                                                               [4]

     (b)   Suggest why forecasts become less accurate the more long range they become.                [4]

     (c)   Discuss whether historical data can be accurately used to forecast future weather.         [5]

     The simulation of the weather forecasting models produces specific data which can be output
     in a variety of ways.

     (d)   (i)    Define the term visualization.                                                      [2]

		         (ii)   With the help of examples, discuss how the development in the way such data
                  is visualized has made the results of these simulations more accessible to the
                  general public.                                                                     [6]

                                                                                                Turn over
                                                   –6–                  N17/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

Option C — Web science
7.   BuildYourWebSite is an online company that provides a number of common templates for
     building your own website. Each template includes one HTML file, one CSS file, a folder of
     web images, and a folder of special sound effects.

     (a)   Identify two characteristics of HTML.                                                         [2]

     (b)   Discuss the benefits and disadvantages of the template including a CSS file in addition
           to the HTML page.                                                                             [6]

     Each template can be downloaded as a single compressed file, using a web browser.

     (c)   Explain why TCP/IP is a reliable protocol in relation to downloading operations.              [3]

     (d)   Evaluate lossy compression and lossless compression when used to download files.              [4]


8.   Open source code is made available by a community of developers and is frequently
     updated. The code can be downloaded for free, but users must register with the website and
     have their access authenticated.

     (a)   Evaluate the use of server-side scripting to provide the mechanism for registration.          [4]

     Authentication is based on signing in to an established third-party company, for example a
     user’s existing email or a social network account. The third-party company then verifies the
     user, granting them access to the open source code website.

     (b)   Explain how the user’s privacy can be maintained whilst using this method of
           authentication.                                                                               [4]

     The URL of this website is www.OpenSourceDev.org. Any new pieces of code that the
     developers make available become new resources on the website. A script generates
     weekly automatic notifications of new code available on the site, and sends this notification to
     users as an email.

     (c)   (i)    Outline, with an example, how the URL for these new pieces of code will
                  be generated.                                                                          [2]

		         (ii)   Outline the steps that the script could perform for sending out these notifications.   [3]

(Option C, question 8 continued)

     A fragment of a script and a web form are provided below.
     In the script some functions are not implemented, and only their specification is provided.

  <?php
		 //include a database of urls
		include('url_db.php');
		 $url = $short = "";

        $y = first4_last4($x);
				 $z = limits($x);
				 $v = $y. ".".$z; //string concatenation
				return $v;
			}

			 function make_alpha_string($u)
			 { // It removes, in this order: substrings corresponding to
				 // protocol names, the substring www, and all characters

   function first4_last4($u)
   { // It returns the string made of the first 4 characters
     // followed by the last 4 characters of $u
			}

			 function limits($u)
    { // It returns the string made of the first character and
				 // last character of $u
			}

			mysql_query("
				 INSERT INTO url_db(orig_url, short_url, url_ip) VALUES
				( '".$_POST['url']."',
					'".$short."',
					 '".$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']."'
				)

     <br><br>
     <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Submit" />
     </form>

     (d)   Describe the processing that occurs when the form is filled with the URL
           https://www.the2nd.org/bin.php?id=70 that the server discovers is associated
           with the IP address 172.16.254.1.                                                         [3]

9.   A museum has an online catalogue of its pieces. No new pieces have been acquired over
     the past 20 years, and the museum has already been at risk of closure for lack of funding.
     Its website consists only of static web pages.

     It is suggested that the museum’s static web pages may be contributing to the museum’s
     lack of success.

 (a) Identify three differences between a static web page and dynamic web page.                     [3]
		
 (b) Suggest two services, and the benefits that they would provide, if the museum were to
     redesign its website to be dynamic.                                                            [4]

     (c)   Explain how the provision of services on the museum’s website can increase its
           rankings in search engines.                                                              [4]

     It is also suggested that the museum’s basic catalogue be revised and upgraded with all of
     the museum’s pieces being catalogued using meta-tags.

     (d)   Suggest how the use of meta-tags can be relevant for search engine optimization.         [3]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A restaurant uses an object-oriented program to manage the cost of the food and drink consumed
by customers. Everytime a table is occupied a Payment object is instantiated which will contain
details of the items ordered. As each item is ordered, a FoodItem or a DrinkItem object is added
to the Payment object as appropriate.
public class Payment
{
  private FoodItem[] fi = new FoodItem[100];
  private int fiCount;
  private static double foodTax = 0.2; // 20 % sales tax added to
										                               // all food prices
  private DrinkItem[] di = new DrinkItem[100];
  private int diCount;
  private static double drinkTax = 0.1; // 10 % sales tax added to
										                               // all drink prices
  public Payment()
  {
    fiCount = 0;
    diCount = 0;
  }

 public DrinkItem getDi(int x)
 {
		return di[x];
 }

    // all other accessor and mutator methods are included

    // addFoodItem() – this method adds a new FoodItem object
    // addDrinkItem() – this method adds a new DrinkItem object

    public static double findPrice(Item[] pl, String c)
    { //code missing }

    // calculateBill() – This method returns the bill (the total value of
    // the items consumed for a particular table)
}

public class FoodItem
{
  private String itemCode;
  private int quantity;

 public FoodItem(String x, int y)
 {
   itemCode = x;
		 quantity = y;
 }

    // all accessor and mutator methods are included
}

The DrinkItem class is defined in a similar way.

10.   Whenever a Payment object is instantiated, the variables fiCount and diCount are
      initialized to 0 through the code in the constructor.
      (a)   Outline an alternative method of initializing these variables that would not require the
            use of the code in the constructor.                                                         [2]
      (b)   State the implication of the use of the term static in the Payment class.                   [2]
      (c)   With reference to two examples from the classes on page 10, explain the benefits
            gained by the use of different data types.                                                  [4]
      (d)   Describe the purpose of the following statement:                                            [3]
			private FoodItem[] fi = new FoodItem[100];
      The Payment class method addFoodItem() is passed a FoodItem object as a parameter.
      (e)   Construct the method addFoodItem().                                                         [3]

11.   The global variable tables is declared as follows:

			Payment[] tables = new Payment[50];

      The indices in this array represent the table number, so tables[1] is a Payment object for
      the customers occupying table number 1.

      The driver (main) class contains the following code. Note: You can assume that all
      appropriate accessor and mutator methods have been included in their respective classes.

      tables[1] = new Payment();
      tables[2] = new Payment();
      FoodItem a = new FoodItem("f102", 2);
      FoodItem b = new FoodItem("f100", 1);
      DrinkItem c = new DrinkItem("d102", 3);
      tables[1].addFoodItem(a);
      tables[1].addFoodItem(b);
      tables[2].addDrinkItem(c);
      tables[2].addDrinkItem(new DrinkItem("d103",1));
      System.out.println(tables[1].getFiCount());
      System.out.println(Payment.getFoodTax());
      System.out.println(tables[2].getDi(1).getItemCode());
      (a)   State the output after this code is executed.                                          [3]
      (b)   Construct statements, in code, that will print out the following:
		          (i)    The number of drink items ordered by table 40.                                  [1]
		          (ii)   The item code of the third food item ordered by table 2.                        [1]

(Option D, question 11 continued)

      The price of each item is stored in an object of the Item class.
      The class is outlined below:

  public class Item
  {
		  private String code;    // item code
		  private String name;    // item name
		  private double price;   // unit price before tax
		 // all accessor, mutator and constructor methods are included
  }

      All of the objects in this class are held in the global array pl according to the following
      declaration: Item[] pl = new Item[200];
      Note: The number of objects held in this array will change from week to week.

      The method findPrice(Item[] pl, String c) in the Payment class looks up and returns
      the price of the item with code c.

      (c)   Construct the method findPrice(). You may assume that the item exists in the array.     [6]

      When a customer wishes to pay the bill, the calculateBill() method is called. If the bill
      was for table 10 then the following call would be made:

		double finalBill = tables[10].calculateBill(Item[] pl);

      (d)   Construct the calculateBill() method. You should make use of any previously
            defined methods.                                                                        [7]


12.   (a)   Construct a diagram showing the relationships between the Payment, FoodItem,
            DrinkItem, and Item classes. You do not need to include the names of attributes
            or methods.                                                                             [3]

      (b)   By making reference to any of the above classes, describe two benefits that a
            programming team would gain from the use of encapsulation.                              [6]

      The company that owns this restaurant also owns hotels, shops, and a car hire business.
      The programs that manage the finances of these different businesses include classes similar
      to the ones shown in this paper.

      (c)   Explain how inheritance could be used as a tool to both improve the clarity of the
            design and to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.                       [4]
