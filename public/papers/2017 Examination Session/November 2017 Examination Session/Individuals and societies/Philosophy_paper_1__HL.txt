                                                  Section A

Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [25 marks].

Core theme: Being human

1.   Read the following article and develop your response as indicated below.

     If emotions are vital to the survival of any half intelligent creature we should expect complex robots
     to evolve their own emotions just as the higher animals have done. The emotions that a creature
     needs to survive depends on the creature’s lifestyle and habitat, consequently robot and human
     emotions might come to evolve in very different ways. Fear of a battle for supremacy between
     human and machine might be misplaced as complex robots could become our friends rather than
     our enemies.
