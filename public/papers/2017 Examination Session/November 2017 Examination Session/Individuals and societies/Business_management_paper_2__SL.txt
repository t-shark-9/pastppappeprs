Answer one question from this section.

1.   Pelican Pies (PP)

     Pelican Pies (PP) produces high-quality pies that have limited brand loyalty outside of their local
     market. The prices of the pies are higher than those of PP’s competitors.

     Table 1: Selected financial information for PP for the year ending 30 April 2017.

       Number of pies sold                              8000
       Price of each pie sold                          $4.00
       Cost of goods sold per pie                      $1.75
       Expenses
       • Electricity per month                          $200
       • Rent of premises per quarter                  $1000
       • Promotional expenses per year                 $1000
       8 % interest per year paid on a loan of       $40 000
       Tax                                         25 % of profits

     For 2018, PP’s owner, Austin, is looking to increase sales beyond the local market by lowering
     prices and spending a greater proportion of PP’s promotional budget on above-the-line methods
     such as regional newspaper advertisements.  To finance this type of promotion, Austin will have to
     increase his loan amount by $10 000.

     Table 2: Selected financial information for the year ending 30 April 2018.

       Number of pies sold                          20 % increase on 2017 figure
       Price of each pie sold                      30 % decrease on 2017 figure
       Cost of goods sold per pie                               $1.75
       Expenses
       • Electricity per month                                   $200

2.   Moverse

     Moverse operates in the health and fitness sector.  Moverse is not a traditional gym with machines
     (equipment) and fitness instructors (trainers).  The instructors themselves travel and run fitness
     classes in the buildings of large companies. Instructors all work part-time and are paid wages on a
     time rate basis.

     Moverse currently sells its services to several large companies. They have a total of 727
     employees enrolled on its programme.

     • Moverse charges a yearly fee of $145 for each employee participating.
     • Moverse’s fixed costs are $60 000 per year.
     • The variable cost per employee taking part in the programme is $45.


     (a)   Describe the time rate method of paying wages.                                              [2]

                                                Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Davenport Electronics (DE)

     Davenport Electronics (DE) is a small company that manufactures remote control electronic
     devices that open garage doors. The devices are kept in owners’ cars. For years, DE devices
     operated in a fashion similar to those of its three competitors. When an owner activated the
     remote control, a unique password was transmitted and the garage door opened.

     Unit sales and revenue had not grown for several years until, four years ago, some computer
     hackers discovered how to steal passwords when remote controls are activated. With the
     passwords, hackers could later open garage doors and steal their contents. For DE and its
     competitors (whose products operated in a similar manner), sales began to decline.

     DE responded by developing a way to change the unique password every time a remote control
     is activated. Thus, by the time a hacker successfully steals a password, the password no longer
     works. DE’s innovation significantly enhanced the security of a DE remote control.

     The three competitors are all larger than DE.

                           Price of remote        Quality
                               control           perception
       Company A                 High              Medium
       Company B               Medium              Medium
       Company C                 Low               Medium
       DE                      Medium                High

     As a result of this innovation, DE’s market share and scale of operation have increased. However,
     DE is now experiencing diseconomies of scale. Some managers also worry that, with the pressure
     to meet increased orders, the company will lose its focus on quality. Other managers believe that
     future success in the industry will depend on frequent innovation.


     (a)    Define the term diseconomy of scale.                                                       [2]

     (b)    Using the table, construct a product position map/perception map for all
            four companies.                                                                            [4]

     (c)    (i)    Draw and label a product life cycle curve.                                          [2]

		          (ii)   Explain how DE’s innovation is an extension strategy.                               [2]

     (d)    With reference to DE, discuss the merits of small organizations compared to large
            organizations.                                                                          [10]

4.   Grunsburg Textiles (GT )

     Grunsburg Textiles (GT ) is a textile company founded by the paternalistic leader Henrik Steiner.
     As the company grew, it became very committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR). “Our
     aims,” GT says on its website, “include making profits, providing safe and secure employment,
     contributing to society through investment in environmentally friendly production practices and
     supporting ethical causes”. Many people believe that GT’s success is tied to its reputation for
     taking care of its employees and for its commitment to CSR.

     In 2015, GT purchased €44 million in new environmentally friendly equipment.  It financed the
     purchase with a bank loan. GT originally forecasted that the new equipment would generate
     €8 million in annual net cash flow.  Instead, the actual increase in GT’s annual net cash flow
     from the new equipment was only €6 million.  The Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Elaine, warned
     Henrik that unless net cash flow increased significantly, the average rate of return (ARR) would be
     significantly lower than originally forecasted.

     GT is struggling to make the loan payments and to have sufficient working capital.  Elaine
     determined that one way to shorten the working capital cycle is debt factoring. However, when she
     approached several (debt) factors, she was discouraged by their proposed discount rates.

     Elaine knows that the situation is worse than she had warned. If the economy were to weaken
     and revenue to decline, she believes that the company could go out of business. Proposals for a
     solution include cutting back on GT’s commitment to its employees and CSR practices.


     (a)   State any two stages of the working capital cycle.                                            [2]

     (b)   Calculate for GT:

		         (i)    the payback period for the €44 million investment in new equipment based on the
                  forecasted increase in net cash flow (show all your working).                          [2]

		         (ii)   the average rate of return (ARR) based on an annual increase in net cash flow of
                  €6000 and assuming an asset life of the new equipment of eight years (show all
                  your working).                                                                         [2]

     (c)   With reference to GT, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of debt factoring.           [4]

     (d)   Examine Elaine’s proposals to cut back on GT’s commitment to its employees and
           CSR practices.                                                                            [10]

5.   Green Clean (GC)

     Green Clean (GC) is a private limited company controlled by the Hitta family. Its unique selling
     point (USP) is offering high-quality, reliable cleaning services by teams of professional cleaners
     who clean offices and houses.

     GC has strong ethical objectives. They only use eco-friendly cleaning products and pay their
     employees fair wages. Labour turnover is low and many cleaners have worked for the company
     for over two decades.

     However, the cleaning market has become very competitive. GC has been slow to react. Other
     cleaning companies are beginning to offer a wider range of services.  GC’s management has
     decided to introduce a gardening service to maximize profit.

     GC will recruit professionally trained gardeners.  As it is very difficult to find professional gardeners
     in the market, GC will pay them 20 % more than its cleaners. GC prefers to use external
     recruitment. GC’s management will also offer cleaners the opportunity to become gardeners
     even though off-the-job training costs are very high.  If most of GC’s cleaners choose training, the
     company could fall short of workers to meet the demand for cleaning services.

     The cleaners are becoming demotivated because they are unhappy about the difference in pay
     between cleaners and future gardeners. They believe that gardeners are not more skilled than
     cleaners but just have a different skill set.  Human resource managers are concerned about the
     potential impact of demotivated cleaners and are looking for ways to improve morale. One option
     they are considering is to offer cleaners an employee-share ownership scheme.  Shareholders,
     however, are opposed to this proposal.


     (a)   Define the term ethical objective.                                                               [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for GC of recruiting gardeners
           externally.                                                                                      [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for GC of using off-the-job training for
           the cleaners who would like to become gardeners.                                                 [4]

     (d)   With reference to two motivation theories, examine the motivation of cleaners at GC.           [10]
