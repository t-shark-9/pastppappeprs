 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
 10–12     The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
 7–9       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
           historical context.

           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
 4–6       The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
           understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
 1–3       There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1   Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   With reference to two societies, evaluate the factors that were most effective in the transmission of
     ideas and cultures.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of a range of factors in terms of their effectiveness in
     transmitting ideas and cultures in or between two societies. In their responses, candidates will
     refer to specific factors, which may include force, trade, transportation, exploration and/or the
     spread of religious beliefs. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this
     topic, the two societies do not need to be contemporaneous with each other. Further, those two
     societies may or may not be drawn from separate regions. Candidates may elect to deal with the
     question thematically, for example identifying specific factors and comparing how they affected the
     chosen societies. They may also attempt to rank the factors, outlining why some were more
     significant than others. Alternatively, candidates may choose to address the two societies
     separately and evaluate the factors that were specific to each.


2.   With reference to two societies, compare and contrast the treatment of religious minorities.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the way that two societies
     treated religious minorities, referring to both societies throughout the response. Candidates may
     focus on a range of religious minority groups, a group specific to each of the chosen societies or
     even one religious minority that was common to both societies. While the focus of the response
     must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two societies do not need to be contemporaneous
     with each other. Further, those two societies may or may not be drawn from separate regions.
     Treatment of minorities may be positive, negative or a combination of both positive and negative
     features.

Topic 2   Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   With reference to two wars, to what extent do you agree that competition for resources was the
     main factor contributing to the outbreak of conflict?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that competition for resources
     was the main factor that contributed to the outbreak of two wars. While the focus of the response
     must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars need not have occurred at the same time
     and, if one or both of the wars take place at the beginning of the period, then some material
     immediately prior to 750 is permissible. The two wars may or may not be chosen from different
     regions. Candidates must address the competition for resources, which may include fertile land,
     water, labour and/or mineral wealth, and consider the relative importance of this as a main factor.
     Candidates will also consider other factors that may or may not have been of greater or lesser
     importance. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used where
     candidates wish to compare the relative importance of relevant factors for each war chosen.


4.   “Taxation was the most effective means of raising an army.” Discuss with reference to two wars,
     each from a different region.

     With reference to two wars, candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the
     hypothesis that taxation was the most effective means of raising an army. While the focus of the
     response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two wars need not have occurred at the
     same time. However, each of the examples chosen must be from a different region. Factors other
     than taxation, such as religious belief, tributary obligations, the promise of wealth from divided
     spoils, and/or the threat of punishment may be discussed to support arguments that may or may
     not agree with the hypothesis. Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach
     may be used if candidates wish to compare the relative importance of relevant factors for each
     war.
                                                 –6–                  N17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 3   Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   To what extent were two rulers successful in achieving their aims?

     Candidates will consider the extent to which two rulers succeeded in achieving their aims. While
     the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two rulers need not be
     contemporaries and may or may not be chosen from different regions. In each case, candidates
     must clearly state the aims of each chosen ruler and these may be assessed in relation to factors
     such as domestic policies, foreign policies and/or dynastic ambitions. The achievement, or not, of
     the aims outlined may provide a basis to determine how far the rulers were successful. Each ruler
     may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if candidates wish to compare
     the aims and success of each ruler.


6.   “Governing institutions relied more on religious law than on secular law.” Discuss with reference to
     two dynastic states.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis with reference made to
     two dynastic states. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the
     two dynastic states need not be contemporaneous with each other and may or may not be chosen
     from different regions. Candidates must identify the governing institutions and discuss the
     relationship between these and the relevant legal systems to determine how far they were reliant
     either on religious or secular law. Candidates may determine the primacy of secular or religious
     law, suggest that both were of equal importance or that the boundaries between these legal
     systems were fluid and not always easy to distinguish. Each dynastic state may be considered
     separately or a thematic approach may be used if candidates chose to address the reliance of both
     states on one type of legal system before moving onto the next.
                                                    –7–                  N17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4    Societies in Transition (1400–1700)

7.   Evaluate the significance of two intellectual/scientific figures.

     Candidates will appraise the significance of two intellectual or scientific figures from the period
     indicated by the timeframe of this topic. One or both of the individuals chosen may have been
     influential in art, philosophy, literature and/or other intellectual endeavours. Alternatively, they may
     have risen to prominence due to their contributions to science. The two figures need not be
     contemporaries and they may or may not be chosen from the same state or region. Candidates
     may explain the significance of the figures by indicating the impact they had during their lifetime.
     However, it may be that the examples chosen gained greater prominence in later periods.
     Knowledge will be used to address their significance and for this to go beyond a description of their
     work. Each figure may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be adopted if
     candidates choose to compare the degree of significance.


8.   Evaluate the methods used to achieve religious expansion and conversion in two societies.

     Candidates will appraise the methods used in two societies to spread religion and to acquire
     converts. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two
     societies chosen need not be contemporaneous with each other and they may or may not be
     chosen from the same region. The effectiveness of the methods used for expansion and
     conversion, including their strengths and limitations, will be appraised. Such appraisal may include
     an assessment of the effectiveness of the methods, the impact of their cost—either financial or in
     regards to human resources—and/or the impact on the converted population. Each society may
     be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if the candidates choose to
     compare the methods used.
                                                  –8–                  N17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 5    Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Compare and contrast the methods of government in two established states.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the methods of government in
      two states, focusing on both states throughout the response. While the focus of the response must
      be within the timeframe of this topic, the two states chosen need not be contemporaneous with
      each other and they may or may not be chosen from the same region. Methods to be considered
      may include, the use of religious law, common law, a tributary system, a bureaucratic system of
      regional representatives of the state or rule by a military elite. These may have been effective or
      ineffective or a combination of both.


10.   “The political organization of colonial states was mainly influenced by the relationship between the
      state and religion.” Discuss with reference to two states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that the political
      organization of colonial states was influenced mainly by the relationship between the state and
      religion—be that a local religion, one introduced by the metropole or a range of religions present in
      the chosen states. “Colonial states” refers to those states that were ruled by representatives of the
      metropole and while the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two
      states chosen need not be contemporaneous with each other and they may or may not be chosen
      from the same region. Similarly, the religion(s) of the chosen colonial states may be the same or
      different. Each colonial state may be considered separately or a thematic approach may be used if
      the candidates choose to compare the ways in which the relationship was similar or different.
                                                 –9–                  N17/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 6    Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the importance of leadership in determining the outcome of two Early Modern wars.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the role of leadership as it influenced the outcome of two
      Early Modern wars. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the
      two wars chosen need not have occurred at the same time and they may or may not be chosen
      from the same region. One or more leaders may be chosen for each war, if applicable.
      Alternatively, where the same leader(s) fought in two wars, the impact of their leadership on the
      outcome of each war, may be evaluated. Candidates may compare such factors as personal
      attributes/skills, military planning, the use of technology or they may collectively weigh the
      importance of other factors such as terrain or natural conditions that affected the outcome of war.
      Each war may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted to weigh the strengths
      and limitations of leadership in relation to each relevant factor.


12.   Evaluate the social and religious impact of one Early Modern war.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the social as well as the religious impact of one war taken
      from the period. Depending on the links made, it may also be permissible for the impact of the war
      to extend beyond the timeframe. Candidates may interpret “impact” as referring to events that
      occurred as the war was being fought as well as when the war itself was over but its repercussions
      were being felt. Examples chosen may allow for an evaluation of possible ways in which the war
      had an impact and these may include the institutionalization of religion, the replacement of one
      form of worship by another, social upheaval and/or the spread of disease by marauding armies.
      Arguments will consider the changes brought about by war and consider the strength and
      limitations of the factors indicated.

Topic 7     Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   To what extent did industrialization in two countries rely upon developments in transportation?

      Candidates will consider the merits of the concept that industrialization relied upon developments
      in transportation. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the
      periods under discussion need not be contemporaneous with each other and the two countries
      chosen may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer an analysis of the overall
      importance of transportation in relation to the pace of industrialization and weigh it against other
      factors. The chosen countries may be addressed separately or a thematic approach may be
      adopted to consider the merits, or otherwise, of the concept. Factors that may be considered could
      range from the construction of roads, railways and canals to facilitate the transportation of raw
      materials and finished products as well as the distribution of goods by air or by sea. Alternatively,
      other factors such as the supply of labour, availability of resources and technological
      developments, may be considered of greater or lesser importance.


14.   Discuss the impact of urbanization on two industrialized states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of how urbanization affected two
      industrialized states. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic,
      the two states chosen need not be contemporaneous with each other and they may or may not be
      chosen from the same region. The period of urbanization to be discussed may vary in length
      according to the examples chosen as it may have been achieved relatively quickly or taken place
      over an extended period of time. Factors to be considered may include the growth of local and
      national government, in order to address a range of needs, including better sanitation and housing
      (to prevent the spread of epidemics), the provision of transportation links between cities, the need
      to find ways to address congestion and pollution and how to finance such projects. Candidates
      may also discuss the impact of urbanization on the growth of democracy and the spread of political
      ideologies, along with the breakdown of traditionally deferential societies. Each industrialized state
      may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted to compare the impact on each
      state.

Topic 8     Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   To what extent did external factors rather than internal factors contribute to the growth of two
      independence movements?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that external rather than internal
      factors contributed to the growth of two independence movements and, depending on the
      examples chosen, may argue that either one was more influential. While the focus of the response
      must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two movements chosen need not have occurred at
      the same time and they may or may not be chosen from the same region. Responses will be
      confined to the period of the growth of the independence movements and references to the period
      after the achievement of independence are unlikely to be relevant. Explicit links will be provided,
      indicating how the factors identified affected the growth of the independence movements. Each
      independence movement may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted to
      compare the impact of internal and external factors that may have affected each movement.


16.   “Strong leadership was essential to the success of independence movements.” Discuss with
      reference to two independence movements, each from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the validity of the hypothesis that strong
      leadership was essential to the success of two independence movements. While the focus of the
      response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two independence movements chosen
      need not have occurred at the same time. However, they must be chosen from different regions.
      Strong leadership may be defined by the candidates as comprising one or more individuals. There
      must be a discussion of the role of leadership in the independence movement, although candidates
      may argue that is was or was not essential to success. Additionally, other factors that may be
      identified, such as economic and social conditions, the growth of nationalism and/or political
      movements, should be linked to the success of the movements. Each independence movement
      may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted to compare the importance of
      strong leadership and how it affected each movement.

Topic 9    Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Evaluate the impact of domestic crises on the development of two democratic states.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of domestic crises on the development of two
      democratic states. While the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the
      two democratic states chosen need not be contemporaneous with each other and they may or may
      not be chosen from the same region. Candidates may choose to discuss the development of a
      democratic state (including, where relevant, its evolution) throughout the timeframe or to focus on a
      series of domestic crises that occurred within a narrower timespan. Candidates may address
      “development” in a variety of different ways by, for example, focusing on political, economic or
      social development. There must be clear links between the crises chosen and their impact on the
      development of the state. Each democratic state may be considered separately or a thematic
      approach adopted to compare the impact of similar or different domestic crises on the development
      of each state.


18.   “The maintenance of democracy was dependent on freedom of expression in the arts and media.”
      Discuss with reference to two democratic states, each from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that the maintenance of
      democracy was dependent upon the freedom of expression in the arts and the media. While the
      focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this topic, the two democratic states chosen
      need not be contemporaneous with each other. However, they must be chosen from different
      regions. Arguments may be made in favour of and/or against the statement. While the focus must
      be on the dependency of democracy on freedom in the arts/media, some candidates may argue
      that the two were interdependent. Others may argue that democracy was more dependent on
      other factors such as an independent judicial system, access to education or fair distribution of
      economic wealth. Each democratic state may be considered separately or a thematic approach
      adopted to compare the relative dependence on the freedom of the arts and media.

Topic 10   Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   To what extent did economic factors contribute to the emergence of two authoritarian states, each
      from a different region?

      Candidates must consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that economic factors contributed
      to the emergence of authoritarian states. While the focus of the response must be within the
      timeframe of this topic, the two authoritarian states chosen need not be contemporaneous with
      each other. However, they must be chosen from different regions. Although candidates must
      discuss the extent to which economic factors contributed to the emergence of the chosen states, it
      is probable that there will also be reference to the emergence of the relevant authoritarian leaders.
      However, focus will be maintained on the emergence of the authoritarian state and how this was
      achieved. Each authoritarian state may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted
      to compare the relative contribution of economic and other factors, such as ideology, for example,
      on their emergence.


20.   “The maintenance of power was dependent on the successful control of opposition.” Discuss with
      reference to two authoritarian leaders.

      Candidates must offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that the maintenance of
      power by authoritarian leaders was dependent on the successful control of opposition. Two
      authoritarian leaders must be chosen and while the focus of the response must be within the
      timeframe of this topic, the two leaders need not be contemporaries nor must they be chosen from
      different regions. Candidates may agree with the statement or they may argue that the
      authoritarian leaders were able to maintain their power because of success in other areas, for
      example the provision of employment, an appeal to nationalism and/or a popular foreign policy.
      Responses must focus on the period that the chosen leaders were in power. Each authoritarian
      leader may be considered separately or a thematic approach adopted to compare the control of
      opposition, its relative success and its impact upon the maintenance of power.

Topic 11   Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   Evaluate the impact of the mobilization of human and economic resources on the outcome of one
      20th-century war.

      Candidates will appraise the impact of human and economic resources upon the outcome of one
      war chosen from the timeframe of the topic. Depending on the war chosen, candidates’ analyses
      of the outcome may extend into the early years of the 21st century. In this way, events that
      occurred outside of the topic timeframe may be considered relevant. In their evaluation, some
      candidates may note the mobilization of armies and/or the procurement of arms. Both of these are
      appropriate examples of how human and economic resources were mobilized. To contextualize
      the impact of the named resources, candidates may choose to consider the impact of other factors,
      such as the involvement of foreign powers or the use of advanced technology.


22.   Evaluate the impact of two 20th-century wars on the role and status of women.

      Candidates will appraise the impact on the role and status of women of two wars chosen from the
      timeframe of the topic. Depending on the wars chosen, candidates’ analyses of the impact on the
      role and status of women may extend into the early years of the 21st century. The wars chosen
      may or may not have occurred at the same time, but they must come from different regions. Both
      the role and the status of women need to be evaluated and reference may be made to the period
      of the duration of the war or to its aftermath, as long as there are clear links to the wars chosen.
      The impact of each war may be considered separately, or a thematic approach adopted comparing
      the various ways in which each war had an impact on women.

Topic 12   The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “Confrontation rather than reconciliation ended the Cold War.” Discuss with reference to the period
      from 1980 to 1991.

      Candidates must offer a considered and balanced review of the hypothesis that it was
      confrontation rather than reconciliation that brought about the end of the Cold War. The timeframe
      is explicitly stated within the question and the response will cover events up to but not beyond
      1991, which is when the Soviet Union collapsed. The relative importance of both confrontation and
      reconciliation must be considered as factors that ended the Cold War. For confrontation, reference
      may be made to the tension that dominated superpower relations prior to 1985 as well as the
      impact of the Soviet–Afghan War on superpower relations. Additionally, candidates may choose to
      consider the confrontation between Gorbachev and anti-reformists within the Soviet Union. For
      reconciliation, the relative harmony that characterized the Reagan–Gorbachev summits as well as
      the support for economic reforms that came from the populations and some leaders of the Eastern
      Bloc may be discussed.


24.   Evaluate the impact of two leaders, each from a different region, on the course of the Cold War.

      Candidates need to make an appraisal of the impact of two leaders upon the course of the Cold
      War. The term “leaders” applies to political leaders who led their respective states within the
      period of the Cold War and while the focus of the response must be within the timeframe of this
      topic, the two leaders need not be contemporaries. They must, however, be chosen from different
      regions. The response must refer specifically to the way in which the chosen leaders affected the
      course of the Cold War and this could be addressed by explaining how their policies may have
      improved or worsened superpower relations. Alternatively, leaders of smaller states may also be
      chosen as examples if they had considerable impact on the course of the Cold War by
      commencing actions that led to wars or crises.
