                                      Theme: Education and training
IT system: Virtual learning environment (VLE) for learners to participate in online courses

      A massive open online course (MOOC) is an online course delivered over the web and aimed at a
      large number of learners. Well-known universities, such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology
      (MIT) and Harvard, were the first to develop a platform where their professors could collaborate
      and contribute to an open access (OA) education.

 5    MOOCs offer an education to a wide range of people, such as stay-at-home parents, retirees and
      students who are looking for an alternative to the traditional face-to-face (F2F) classroom. There
      are no entry requirements for MOOCs. Anyone may enrol on a course, no matter where they live
      or what qualifications they hold.

      MOOCs are the latest trend in online learning and have been used by over 400 universities.
10    In 2014 there were 2400 courses and between 16 and 18 million registered learners. However,
      these courses have been criticized for their low completion rates. In some cases, only 7 % of
      learners finished the course, in others, 25 % of learners did not view the content of the first module.

      MOOCs consist of a range of online content on plain HTML pages or more interactive pages
      (Figure 1). Some courses are synchronous and users may make use of features such as
15    interactive whiteboards, live chats and webinars*. Others may be asynchronous with uploaded
      recorded video lectures and collaborative learning in the form of blogs and online discussions.

      Having very large numbers of learners can be challenging for the IT support team and also for
      course managers. The cost of developing a MOOC can be up to $300 000 depending on the
      quality and complexity of the course interface, which smaller universities may not be able to afford.

20    MOOCs are available 24 hours per day and seven days per week, and some are free. MOOCs do
      not always lead to a formal qualification but they allow learners to develop their careers or personal
      interests in their own time.

      Some employers are now looking at MOOCs as indicators of an employee’s motivation and
      willingness for personal development. However, a recent survey showed that 56 % of employers
25    still preferred a job applicant with a degree from a traditional university as opposed to one from an
      online course.

      There are concerns about the future of MOOCs. Will they replace traditional universities?
      What will be the impact on lecturers? Are MOOCs sustainable?
