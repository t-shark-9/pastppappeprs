(b)   Using an exchange rate diagram, explain how Denmark’s central bank is
      maintaining the fixed value of the Danish krone against the euro (paragraph ).      [4]

               For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram with a
               shift of the supply curve of the Danish krone to the right and a
               fall in the exchange rate or for an explanation that the central
               bank is supplying Danish krone to buy euros, thus increasing the
               supply of the Danish krone on the foreign exchange market and
               bringing the value of the Danish krone back to the fixed rate.
       2       There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.        3–4
               For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram with a
               shift of the supply curve of the Danish krone to the right and a
               fall in the exchange rate and for an explanation that the central
               bank is supplying Danish krone to buy euros, thus increasing the
               supply of the Danish krone on the foreign exchange market and
               bringing the value of the Danish krone back to the fixed rate.

      An alternative explanation would be that the central bank has been cutting
      interest rates (paragraph), which will encourage Danish people to save abroad,
      increasing the supply of the krone and bringing the value of the krone back to the
      fixed rate.

      Another alternative approach would be to illustrate and explain how the demand
      for Danish krone has decreased because of the central bank cutting interest
      rates, reducing foreign saving in Danish banks, and bringing the krone back to
      the fixed rate.

               increase in AD with an increase in real GDP and an increase in
               the average price level or for one of the following explanations:
                • lower interest rates may lead to an increase in AD because
                  of an increase in consumption (or investment) and that this
                  would lead to an increase in real GDP and an increase in

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Arguments for maintaining the fixed value may include:
      • greater certainty
      • businesses able to plan ahead with certainty about predicted costs of imported
         factors of production
      • exporters benefit from the fixed (low) value of the Danish krone (paragraph );
         letting it float would lead to a higher value (paragraph ) and would harm
         exporters by making their products less competitive. This may lead to
         unemployment since exports are very important to the Danish economy. It could
         be an “economic catastrophe”. (paragraph )
      • high level of confidence from outside investors and international credit rating
         agencies will make it easier to attract foreign investment (paragraph )
      • if the central bank continues to be able to defend the Danish krone, speculators
         may decide to stop buying it up, thereby stopping the upward pressure
         (paragraph ).
      • according to the central bank, there will be no difficulty in maintaining the peg
         (paragraph )
      • belief that the ability to print krone will enable the government/central bank to
         continue to intervene to defend the peg (paragraph ).

Arguments against the fixed value may include:
• the arrangement might fail, and the central bank may have to break the peg,
   despite what it says (paragraph )
• the speculators may continue to buy up the Danish krone, assuming that at some
   point the central bank will be unable to maintain the peg (paragraph )
• if the central bank does keep printing money to maintain the peg (paragraph ),
   it may lead to demand-pull inflation (monetarist explanation of inflation)
• the central bank may be sacrificing domestic monetary policy options to maintain
   the peg (paragraph )
• perhaps the peg no longer represents the best value for the Danish krone and
   that it is now under-valued against the euro
• other countries could argue that the value of the Danish krone is at an artificially
   low level, making their exports more competitive than they should be, and leading
   to retaliation
• accumulating foreign reserves is a waste of financial assets (paragraph ).

Any reasonable evaluation.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • an explanation of trade protection (tariffs, quotas and other non-tariff barriers to
        support domestic producers)
      • reference to diagram in part (c).

      Justification for trade protection:
      • may reverse the effects of the slowdown in economic growth (paragraph ) by
        reducing demand for imports (net export component of AD will increase)
      • reduced imports will reduce the current account deficit (paragraph ) and
        prevent the Indonesian rupiah from falling further
      • may act as a way to practice import substitution and diversify its economy away
        from the dependence on commodity exports (paragraph )
      • trade protection will prevent imports of “low-quality imported goods” but not
        imports of raw materials, so that domestic manufacturers who use imported raw
        materials will not be damaged and may become more competitive (paragraph )
      • level playing field argument – Indonesia’s average tariff in the past was well
        below others. “Indonesia had been too open to imports of consumer goods in the
        past” and it is simply a correction (paragraph ).

Arguments against trade protection:
• higher prices hurting consumers (paragraph )
• welfare loss, loss of efficiency (paragraph )
• may invite retaliation from trading partners, such as China
• may be seen as hypocritical that Indonesia is seeking freer trade (eg with the UK)
   while also increasing trade protection (paragraph )
• may be difficult to attract foreign direct investment (paragraph ) if the
   government is pursuing interventionist policies such as higher levels of protection
   (paragraph )
• allows Indonesian firms to remain uncompetitive (paragraphs  and )
• will not solve the underlying problem of “crumbling infrastructure and excessive
   regulations” and possibly delay necessary structural reforms (paragraph ).

Any reasonable evaluation.

Responses may include:
• definition of foreign direct investment.

Strengths:
• fills the savings/investment gap (paragraph ), which should lead to economic
    growth
• provides employment in the economy (paragraph ), leading to higher levels of
    consumption, raising living standards
•   should improve the infrastructure in the economy (paragraph ), resulting in an

•   should improve electricity provision (paragraphs  and ), resulting in an
    increase in LRAS, and improvement of living standards of households
•   provides education and training (positive externality of consumption), resulting in

•   provision of tax revenue for the government which may be used to finance
    development objectives
•   industrial zone should lead to higher value-added economic activity

   production
• capital-intensive production methods may not provide much employment, but this

                under-provided in a free market and that the provision of free
                education will correct this, either by shifting the MSC curve to
                the right or by shifting the MPB (demand) curve to the right.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, evaluate
      the role of foreign aid in contributing to economic development in Papua New
      Guinea.                                                                                  [8]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Do not award beyond Level 2 if the answer does not contain reference to the
      information provided.

       1        Few relevant concepts are recognized.                                  1–2
                There is basic knowledge/understanding.
       2        Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable           3–5
                depth.
                There is clear knowledge/understanding.
                There is some attempt at application/analysis.
       3        Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable           6–8
                depth.
                There is clear knowledge/understanding.
                There is effective application/analysis.
                There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory
                and evidence.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of economic development
      • identification of types of aid eg bilateral, tied, grant aid, soft loans, emergency
        relief, emergency financial relief, NGO aid.

      Possible positive outcomes:
      • assistance for women and children crime victims (paragraph )
      • immunizations for young children to protect them from diseases, increasing the
        quality/quantity of future labour (paragraph )
      • provision of free education for girls, pre-school and early learning (paragraph )
      • training for the next generation of PNG police officers improves security and may
        attract FDI (paragraph )
      • benefits of aid which is targeted to improve elements of the HDI (paragraph )
      • aid can contribute to economic growth (paragraph ) which might then be used
        to achieve development objectives.

Possible negative outcomes:
• “a lot of aid money being spent but it is making very little difference”
  (paragraph )
• problems associated with corruption leads to poor functioning of institutions
  (police, justice, health, education, governance) hindering the effectiveness of the
  aid (paragraph )
• problems associated with aid dependency leads to long-term risk when foreign
  aid falls (paragraph )
• NGO aid may allow the government to ignore its development responsibilities
  (paragraph )
• problems associated with lack of effectiveness in improving life expectancy
  (paragraph ).

N.B. To reach level 3, candidates must direct their responses to the issue of promoting
economic development, rather than write in general terms about aid.

Any reasonable evaluation.
