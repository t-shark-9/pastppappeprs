                                               Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   MSS is in Central Tanzania. This area of the country is subject to severe droughts every
     few years, and in other years there can be very heavy rain, causing floods and significant
     damage to roads. Malaria has been a concern, but a government health scheme is reducing
     cases of this disease in children of school-going age. Jacob is considering having a school
     contingency plan for such natural disasters.

     Jacob is concerned that the financial position of the school is not as good as it could be. He
     has prepared a variance analysis for the most recent six months.

           Table 1: Variance analysis for the most recent six months (figures in $000s)

                                       Forecast           Outcome             Variance
             Fees received                60                 58                  -2

             Cash purchases               21                 24                  +3
             Other expenses               13                 15                  +2
             Profit                        8                  1                  -7

     Jacob recognizes the need for change, but his experience tells him that change needs
     careful management and that if something works well it is best left alone. He is planning to
     create an internet connection for the school to help teachers and students to access more
     educational resources. However, this is likely to be expensive and a technical challenge
     due to the school’s remote location and underdeveloped infrastructure. He also has plans to
     improve classroom facilities, but the school does not, at the moment, have sufficient finance.

     Mrs K is discussing with Jacob ways in which the school could become more efficient and
     improve examination results. She wants to increase teacher contact time with students.
     This would mean a better use of resources and should help students to learn more. She
     also wants teachers to observe each other’s lessons with the aim of making suggestions
     for improvements of teaching and learning methods. There could be additional duties
     for teachers, such as supervising students’ spare time and study time. Supervision is
     particularly important at weekends, when some teachers currently go home to their families.

     (a)   Define the term contingency plan.                                                           [2]

     (b)   Explain the usefulness to MSS of the variance analysis in Table 1.                          [4]

     (c)   Explain two restraining forces relating to change at MSS.                                   [4]

     (d)   Discuss human resource strategies that could reduce the impact on employees of the
           changes suggested by Mrs K.                                                                [10]

                                              Section C

Answer the following question.

5.   Jacob wants to introduce the IT centre and internet access as soon as possible. He has
     found a donor who is willing to pay for the installation of an internet connection and for half
     of the monthly subscription. Jacob also has an estimate of the cost to convert the classroom
     and he thinks that MSS can afford it. However, the staff at the school do not think the IT
     centre is a good idea as it is risky due to possible construction problems. They think that
     there are better ways to spend the money and everyone is worried that they will be expected
     to help out with the construction work. The teachers do not want to lose a classroom.

     The staff want Jacob to consider the purchase of an old minibus. At the beginning of the
     term some students have difficulty travelling to the school. Expensive taxis also have to be
     used to bring supplies from the town to the school and to take anyone who is sick into town
     for medical treatment. As well as saving costs and offering greater convenience, the minibus
     could carry excess food grown by the students to town for sale. Teachers would have to
     take turns driving the minibus and sometimes undertake repairs on it. However, the minibus
     would be helpful to the teachers and Mrs K whenever they needed to visit the town.

     Jacob has undertaken research into the two possible options of the IT centre and the
     minibus. He knows that only one option is possible at the moment. He has drawn up a
     decision tree to compare the two options depending on various outcomes.

                                                                       Probability      Expected

                                                                      Optimistic 0.3

(Question 5 continued)

     He has also carried out an investment appraisal based on the most likely outcome, with the
     following results:

     Option 1: convert classroom to IT centre

    • Cost of building the IT centre: $1500
    • Annual increase in income from attracting additional students: $1200
    • Additional annual costs for subscribing to internet access: $500
    • Lifetime of the IT centre: five years
    • Average rate of return (ARR) = 26.7 %			                   Net present value (NPV) at
    					                                                        10 % discount = $1153.

     Option 2: the minibus

    • Cost of buying the minibus: $800
    • Annual savings on taxi fares: $700
    • Additional annual costs (fuel and other costs): $150
    • Lifetime of the minibus: three years
    • Average rate of return (ARR) = 35.4 %			                   Net present value (NPV) at
    					                                                        10 % discount = $567.


     Using the information above and in Figure 1, recommend either Option 1 or Option 2 for
     MSS. You will find it useful to calculate the payback period for the two options.            [20]
