Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be
   given.


1.   (a)   (i)    State one characteristic of a perfectly competitive market.                        [1]

            Level                                                                            Marks

            1         Any one of the following characteristics:                              1
                      • a large number of firms
                      • homogeneous product
                      • absence of barriers to entry (and exit)
                      • price takers
                      • perfect information.

           (ii)   Outline the reason why the coefficient of price in the supply function above is
                  positive.                                                                          [2]

            1         Vague understanding.                                                   1
                      The idea that it is a result of the law of supply OR that there is a
                      positive relationship between price and quantity supplied
            2         Clear understanding.                                                   2
                      A brief explanation that at higher prices, quantities supplied are
                      greater since the profit margins of firms are higher (or reference
                      to the idea that marginal costs are likely to increase as output
                      increases or another valid incentive such as to gain more
                      revenue)

(b)   Calculate the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity in this market.       [2]

      Qd = Qs
      64 − 2P = 4P − 8
      64 + 8 = 4P + 2P
      72 = 6P
      P = $12.00                                                                         [1]

      Q = 4 × 12 − 8
      Q = 40 000 units                                                                   [1]

      The $ sign is required, but “units” is not.

      If both are correct but no valid workings are provided a maximum of [1] may be
      awarded.

(c)   Using the functions, plot the following in the grid below:

      (i)    a fully labelled market demand curve.                                              [1]

      (ii)   a fully labelled market supply curve.                                              [1]




      For a correctly plotted and labelled demand curve.                                        [1]
      For a correctly plotted and labelled supply curve.                                        [1]
      If labels are missing or incorrect a maximum of [1] may be awarded.
      If both labels are missing/incorrect then award [0] marks for part (i) and [1] mark for
      part (ii).

(d)   Using an appropriate example, explain the significance of price elasticity of demand
      in relation to the size of the tax revenues a government collects following the
      imposition of an indirect tax.                                                         [4]

       Level                                                                         Marks

                below.
       1        The written response is limited.                                     1–2
                For explaining that if demand is price inelastic then tax revenues
                collected by the government would be higher than if demand is
                price elastic as quantity demanded would decrease by less
                following the increase in price or for providing an appropriate
                example(s).
       2        The written response is accurate.                                    3–4
                For explaining that if demand is price inelastic then tax revenues
                collected by the government would be higher than if demand is
                price elastic as quantity demanded would decrease by less
                following the increase in price and for providing an appropriate
                example(s). If the example is not explained then the candidate
                can be awarded up to [3].

      The example should relate to product(s) with price elastic and/or price inelastic
      demand.

      A numerical example which shows the effect of an indirect tax on tax revenue (but
      not merely producer revenue) may also be fully rewarded.

      If candidates confuse tax revenue with producer revenue, but demonstrate
      understanding of elasticities and provide a relevant example, they may be awarded
      a maximum of [2] marks.

      N.B.: reference to percentage changes/proportionality is NOT required.

(e)   (i)    State the type of indirect tax under consideration.                                 [1]

             Ad valorem or percentage                                                            [1]

             The name of a tax, such as value-added tax, may not be accepted

      (ii)   Outline the reason for your answer to part (e)(i).                                  [2]

                 The change in “d” value (the coefficient of P) changes the slope
                 of the supply curve OR the idea that the supply curve becomes
                 steeper with an ad valorem tax.
       2         Accurate response.                                                      2
                 For outlining that as price / quantity increases, the size of the tax
                 also increases – consistent with ad valorem – causing the
                 supply curve to be steeper as a result of the change in the
                 coefficient.

      To achieve level 2, the response must refer to the change in the coefficient of price
      (the “d” value) and to the change in the size of the tax as price/quantity increases.

(f)   (i)   The government decides to impose a $3 per unit tax on this perfectly
            competitive market. Plot and label the market supply curve following the
            imposition of this tax in the grid on page 3.                                 [1]




            For a correctly plotted and labelled new supply curve $3 above the original
            supply curve.                                                                 [1]

(ii)   Calculate the resulting consumer expenditure and producer revenue and
       government tax revenue following the imposition of the $3 per unit tax.       [3]

       Consumer expenditure
       14 × 36 000
       $504 000                                                                      [1]
       An answer of $504 000 (without workings) is sufficient for [1].

       Producer revenue
       11 × 36 000
       $396 000                                                                      [1]
       An answer of $396 000 (without workings) is sufficient for [1].

       Tax revenue
       3 × 36 000
       $108 000                                                                      [1]
       An answer of $108 000 (without workings) is sufficient for [1].

       The tax revenue may also be calculated by subtracting producer revenue from
       consumer expenditure.

       OFR applies. Examiners will need to examine the graph carefully and reward
       valid working.

(g)   (i)   In the following grid, sketch an appropriate marginal cost (MC) curve, if q* is
            the profit maximizing level of output for a perfectly competitive firm and the
            market determined price for the good is $20 per unit.                             [1]




            For a correctly sketched MC curve that intersects the horizontal at $20.00 MR
            above q*. The MC curve must cut the $20 line from below ie minimum MC
            must be below $20                                                                 [1]

      (ii)   In the grid above, sketch an average total cost (ATC) curve that would result in
             economic losses for this firm.                                                      [1]




             For a correctly sketched U shaped ATC lying above MR=AR=20 at all
             quantities and with the MC curve intersecting the ATC at the minimum ATC.           [1]

             A labelled MR (or P) curve is not necessary for part (i) or for part (ii).

(h)   If a perfectly competitive firm aiming at profit maximization is producing at a level of
      output for which marginal revenue (MR) > marginal cost (MC), state what action the
      firm should take with respect to its level of output.                                      [1]

      It should increase output.                                                                 [1]

(c)   (i)   Explain one way in which the effect of imposing a tariff is likely to be different
            from that of imposing a quota.                                                       [2]

                Possible responses include:
                • a quota affects the volume of imports while a tariff affects
                   the price
                • a quota has a certain effect on the volume of imports while
                   a tariff does not
                • a tariff leads to tariff revenues but a quota does not.
       2        Clear explanation of one difference                                    2
                Possible responses include:
                • a quota is a quantitative restriction so it affects the volume
                   of imports while a tariff is a tax on imports so it affects the
                   price of imports
                • a quota being a quantitative restriction has a certain effect
                   on the volume of imports while the effect of a tariff is
                   uncertain
                • a tariff leads to tariff revenues but a quota does not lead to
                   tariff revenues because it is a restriction on quantity
                   (imported) OR because others receive the revenue/rent.

               of [1].
               For an accurate explanation of one benefit or a limited
               explanation of two benefits, award a maximum of [2].

               Benefits may include:
               • enjoying a higher price
               • greater volume of sales
               • greater revenues / profits

               limited explanation of a second benefit, award a maximum
               of [3].
               For providing two accurate benefits, award a maximum of [4].

               Accurate explanations may include:
               • the restricted supply of quinoa in the domestic market
                  permits them to enjoy a higher price as they were selling
                  quinoa at US$4.00 per kilogram and now they may sell at
                  US$6.50 per kilogram
               • as a result of the higher price they can increase the
                  quantity they offer from selling 20 million kilograms of
                  quinoa per year and now they sell 45 million kilograms of
                  quinoa per year
               • since they sell more quinoa at a higher price they earn
                  more revenues per period, (from (4 x 20) to (6.50 x 45))
               • since they sell more at a higher price they enjoy a greater
                  producer surplus (20 to 101.25)
               • less competition from foreign producers as imports
                  decrease from 100 to 50
               • any other valid response.

               Award a maximum of [3] if no reference is made to figures or
               the diagram, or if the figures are not all correct.

               The main benefits relate to a higher price, greater quantity,
               increased revenue, less competition and increased producer
               surplus. A candidate who includes two of these in one
               explanation may be fully rewarded. So the third bullet point
               above would earn 4 marks.

      (ii)    Using your answers to part (b)(ii) and (c)(ii), calculate in Fairsea dinars the
              change in the consumer surplus following the introduction of the quota.             [3]

(iii)   Calculate the change in export revenues of foreign farmers (in US dollars)
        following the introduction of the quota, assuming that they sell their quinoa at
        the new Fairsea market price.                                                        [2]

        Initial export revenues in US$ = initial import expenditures earlier:
        100 × 4 = $400 million
        New export revenues:
        50 × 6.5 = US$325 million                                                            [1]

        Change:
        325 − 400

        Any valid working is sufficient for [1]. Identification of initial export revenues
        as equal to initial import expenditures may constitute valid working.

                 higher incomes will worsen the balance of trade.

                 which will worsen the balance of trade.
                 OR
                 For outlining that export-led growth will be caused by/result in an
                 increase in exports, and hence the balance of trade will improve.
                 OR
                 that economic growth may lead to inflation, which would reduce
                 exports/increase imports and worsen the trade balance.

             A response which explains that growth leads to a currency appreciation may
             be awarded a maximum of [1] mark, unless there is reference to export-led
             growth.

(e)   (i)    A politician in Country X has stated that “Our tax system is inequitable as it is
             regressive”. Explain this statement using the data in Table 3.                      [4]

                 For the idea that a tax is regressive if the average tax rate
                 decreases as income increases
       2         The response is accurate.                                             3–4
                 For the idea that a tax is regressive if the average tax rate (ATR)
                 decreases as income increases and since the ATR (or % paid)
                 here is decreasing from 21.75 % (0.22) to 20.25 % (0.20) to
                 19.28 % (0.19) (2 percentages are sufficient) then the tax system
                 of country X is regressive. Therefore, those on higher incomes
                 pay proportionately less, making the tax system unfair.

      (ii)   Apart from taxation, state two other measures which could be taken by a
             government to make the distribution of income more equitable.                       [2]

                 upward pressure on the APL and thus on wages (which are
                 assumed flexible in the long run). The increase in wages will

      For Level 2, reference should be made to increasing wages and the restoration of
