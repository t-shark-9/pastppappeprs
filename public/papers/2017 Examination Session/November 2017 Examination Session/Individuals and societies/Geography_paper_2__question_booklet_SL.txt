		         (v)     Using map evidence, explain one reason, other than climate, why mining in
                   this extreme environment is challenging.                                              [2]

      (a)   (i)    Describe the changing poverty gap between Abidjan and smaller cities over
                   time.                                                                              [2]

		          (ii)   Suggest one reason why the poverty rate in Abidjan is always lower than the
                   poverty rate in the smaller cities.                                                [2]
