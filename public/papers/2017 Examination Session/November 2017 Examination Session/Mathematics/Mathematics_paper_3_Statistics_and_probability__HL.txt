Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Anne is a farmer who grows and sells pumpkins. Interested in the weights of pumpkins
     produced, she records the weights of eight pumpkins and obtains the following results in
     kilograms.

                                7.7 7.5 8.4 8.8 7.3 9.0 7.8 7.6

     Assume that these weights form a random sample from a N(µ , σ 2) distribution.

     (a)   Determine unbiased estimates for µ and σ 2 .                                                  [3]

     (b)   Anne claims that the mean pumpkin weight is 7.5 kilograms. In order to test this claim,
           she sets up the null hypothesis H0 : µ = 7.5 .

		         (i)    Use a two-tailed test to determine the p-value for the above results.

		         (ii)   Interpret your p-value at the 5 % level of significance, justifying your conclusion.   [5]

     A random variable X is distributed with mean µ and variance σ 2 . Two independent random
     samples of sizes n1 and n2 are taken from the distribution of X . The sample means
         —       —
     are X1 and X2 respectively.

     The random variables U , V follow a bivariate normal distribution with product moment
     correlation coefficient ρ .

     (a)   State suitable hypotheses to investigate whether or not U , V are independent.                [2]

     A random sample of 12 observations on U , V is obtained to determine whether there is
     a correlation between U and V .  The sample product moment correlation coefficient is
     denoted by r . A test to determine whether or not U , V are independent is carried out at
     the 1 % level of significance.

     (b)   Find the least value of |r| for which the test concludes that ρ ≠ 0 .                         [6]
