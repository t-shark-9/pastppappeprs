Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a valid Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for a valid Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.

Using the markscheme

1     General

      Mark according to RM assessor instructions.

2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

      • Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked, and
        marks awarded according to the markscheme.
      • It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding
        M mark(s), if any. An exception to this rule is when work for M1 is missing, as opposed to
        incorrect (see point 4).
      • Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, eg M1A1, this usually means M1 for an
        attempt to use an appropriate method (eg substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the
        correct values.
      • Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded independently;
        so if the first value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award A0A1A1.
      • Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks, unless there is a note.
      • Most M marks are for a valid method, ie a method which can lead to the answer: it must
        indicate some form of progress towards the answer.
      • Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further correct working.
        However, if further working indicates a lack of mathematical understanding do not award final A1.

3     N marks

      If no working shown, award N marks for correct answers – this includes acceptable answers (see
      accuracy booklet). In this case, ignore mark breakdown (M, A, R). Where a student only shows
      a final incorrect answer with no working, even if that answer is a correct intermediate answer,
      award N0.

      • Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
      • There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is
        deliberate as it penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
      • There may not be a direct relationship between the N marks and the implied marks. There are
        times when all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks: this indicates that
        we want to see some of the working, without specifying what.
                                                –4–                N17/5/MATME/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


    • For consistency within the markscheme, N marks are noted for every part, even when these
      match the mark breakdown.
    • If a candidate has incorrect working, which somehow results in a correct answer, do not
      award the N marks for this correct answer. However, if the candidate has indicated (usually by
      crossing out) that the working is to be ignored, award the N marks for the correct answer.

4   Implied and must be seen marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets eg (M1).
    • Implied marks can only be awarded if the work is seen or if implied in subsequent working (a
      correct final answer does not necessarily mean that the implied marks are all awarded). There
      are questions where some working is required, but as it is accepted that not everyone will
      write the same steps, all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks for the
      question.
    • Normally the correct work is seen in the next line.
    • Where there is an (M1) followed by A1 for each correct answer, if no working shown, one
      correct answer is sufficient evidence to award the (M1).

    Must be seen marks appear without brackets eg M1.
    • Must be seen marks can only be awarded if the work is seen.
    • If a must be seen mark is not awarded because work is missing (as opposed to M0 or A0
      for incorrect work) all subsequent marks may be awarded if appropriate.

5   Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer (final or intermediate) from
    one part of a question is used correctly in subsequent part(s) or subpart(s). Usually, to award FT
    marks, there must be working present and not just a final answer based on an incorrect
    answer to a previous part. However, if the only marks awarded in a subpart are for the final
    answer, then FT marks should be awarded if appropriate. Examiners are expected to check
    student work in order to award FT marks where appropriate.

    • Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded for work
      which uses the error, but M and R marks may be awarded if appropriate. (However, as noted
      above, if an A mark is not awarded because work is missing, all subsequent marks may be
      awarded if appropriate).
    • Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.
    • If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer
      FT marks.
    • If the error leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the
      sum of an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non-integer value where integer required), do not award the
      mark(s) for the final answer(s).
    • The markscheme may use the word “their” in a description, to indicate that candidates may
      be using an incorrect value.
    • If a candidate makes an error in one part, but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent
      part(s), award marks as appropriate, unless the question says hence. It is often possible to
      use a different approach in subsequent parts that does not depend on the answer to previous
      parts.
    • In a “show that” question, if an error in a previous subpart leads to not showing the required
      answer, do not award the final A1. Note that if the error occurs within the same subpart, the FT
      rules may result in further loss of marks.

6     Mis-read

      If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). A
      candidate should be penalized only once for a particular mis-read. Use the MR stamp to indicate
      that this is a misread. Do not award the first mark in the question, even if this is an M mark, but
      award all others (if appropriate) so that the candidate only loses one mark for the misread.

     • If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer
       marks.
     • If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the
       sum of an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non- integer value where integer required), do not award
       the mark(s) for the final answer(s).
     • Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.

7    Discretionary marks (d)

     An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does
     not cover the work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used and a brief note
     written next to the mark explaining this decision.

8    Alternative methods

     Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
     specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in
     doubt, contact your team leader for advice.

     • Alternative methods for complete parts are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
     • Alternative solutions for parts of questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR. Where
       possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these alternatives
       start and finish.

9    Alternative forms

     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.
     • As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
     • In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
       brackets immediately following the answer.
     • In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations),
       will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the
       bracket or the form in brackets (if it is seen).

10   Calculators

     No calculator is allowed. The use of any calculator on paper 1 is malpractice, and will result in no
     grade awarded. If you see work that suggests a candidate has used any calculator, please follow
     the procedures for malpractice. Examples: finding an angle, given a trig ratio of 0.4235.

11   Style

     The markscheme aims to present answers using good communication, eg if the question asks to
     find the value of k, the markscheme will say k = 3 , but the marks will be for the correct value 3 –
     there is usually no need for the “ k = ”. In these cases, it is also usually acceptable to have
     another variable, as long as there is no ambiguity in the question, eg if the question asks to find
     the value of p and of q, then the student answer needs to be clear. Generally, the only situation
                                                    –6–                N17/5/MATME/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      where the full answer is required is in a question which asks for equations – in this case the
      markscheme will say “must be an equation”.

      The markscheme often uses words to describe what the marks are for, followed by examples,
      using the eg notation. These examples are not exhaustive, and examiners should check what
      candidates have written, to see if they satisfy the description. Where these marks are M marks,
      the examples may include ones using poor notation, to indicate what is acceptable. A valid
      method is one which will allow candidate to proceed to the next step eg if a quadratic function is
      given in factorised form, and the question asks for the zeroes, then multiplying the factors does
      not necessarily help to find the zeros, and would not on its own count as a valid method.

12    Candidate work

      If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
      crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

      Candidates are meant to write their answers to Section A on the question paper (QP), and
      Section B on answer booklets. Sometimes, they need more room for Section A, and use the
      booklet (and often comment to this effect on the QP), or write outside the box. That is fine, and
      this work should be marked.

      The instructions tell candidates not to write on Section B of the QP. Thus they may well have
      done some rough work here which they assume will be ignored. If they have solutions on the
      answer booklets, there is no need to look at the QP. However, if there are whole questions or
      whole part solutions missing on answer booklets, please check to make sure that they are not on
      the QP, and if they are, mark those whole questions or whole part solutions that have not been
      written on answer booklets.

13.   Diagrams

      The notes on how to allocate marks for sketches usually refer to passing through particular points
      or having certain features. These marks can only be awarded if the sketch is approximately the
      correct shape. All values given will be an approximate guide to where these points/features occur.
      In some questions, the first A1 is for the shape, in others, the marks are only for the points and/or
      features. In both cases, unless the shape is approximately correct, no marks can be awarded
      (unless otherwise stated). However, if the graph is based on previous calculations, FT marks
      should be awarded if appropriate.

14.   Accuracy of Answers

      If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the final
      answer to the required accuracy. When this is not specified in the question, all numerical answers
      should be given exactly or correct to three significant figures.

      Do not accept unfinished numerical final answers such as 3/0.1 (unless otherwise stated). As a rule,
      numerical answers with more than one part (such as fractions) should be given using integers (eg 6/8).
      Calculations which lead to integers should be completed, with the exception of fractions which are not
      whole numbers. Intermediate values do not need to be given to the correct three significant figures.
      But, if candidates work with rounded values, this could lead to an incorrect answer, in which case
      award A0 for the final answer. Where numerical answers are required as the final answer to a part of a
      question in the markscheme, the markscheme will show

      a truncated 6 sf value
      the exact value if applicable, the correct 3 sf answer
      Units will appear in brackets at the end.
