Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     The mean value theorem states that if f is a continuous function on [a , b] and differentiable
                                    f (b) − f (a )
     on ]a , b[ then f ′(c) =                      for some c ∈ ]a , b[ .
                                        b−a

     The function g , defined by g ( x) = x cos                ( x ) , satisfies the conditions of the mean value
     theorem on the interval [0 , 5π] .

     (a)   For a = 0 and b = 5π , use the mean value theorem to find all possible values of c for
           the function g .                                                                                                    [6]

           mean value theorem for the function g .                                                                             [4]
