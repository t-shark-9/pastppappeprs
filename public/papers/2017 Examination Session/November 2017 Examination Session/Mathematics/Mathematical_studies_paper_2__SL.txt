Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

     Abdallah owns a plot of land, near the river Nile, in the form of a quadrilateral ABCD.
     The lengths of the sides are AB = 40 m , BC = 115 m , CD = 60 m , AD = 84 m and
     angle BA D = 90˚ .

     The formula that the ancient Egyptians used to estimate the area of a quadrilateral ABCD is

                                               (AB + CD) (AD + BC)

     A company performs an experiment on the efficiency of a liquid that is used to detect a
     nut allergy.

     A group of 60 people took part in the experiment. In this group 26 are allergic to nuts.
     One person from the group is chosen at random.

     (a)   Find the probability that this person is not allergic to nuts.                                [2]

     A second person is chosen from the group.

     (b)   Find the probability that both people chosen are not allergic to nuts.                        [2]

     When the liquid is added to a person’s blood sample, it is expected to turn blue if the person
     is allergic to nuts and to turn red if the person is not allergic to nuts.

     The company claims that the probability that the test result is correct is 98 % for people who
     are allergic to nuts and 95 % for people who are not allergic to nuts.

     It is known that 6 in every 1000 adults are allergic to nuts.

     This information can be represented in a tree diagram.
