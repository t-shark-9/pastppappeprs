Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Answers must be written within
the answer boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by
suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

1.   A group of 20 students travelled to a gymnastics tournament together. Their ages, in years,
     are given in the following table.

     (a)   For the students in this group

           (i)    find the mean age;

           (ii)   write down the median age.                                                                                [3]

     The lower quartile of the ages is 16 and the upper quartile is 18.5.

     (b)   Draw a box-and-whisker diagram, for these students’ ages, on the following grid.                                 [3]

3.   The speed of light is 300 000 kilometres per second. The average distance from the Sun to
     the Earth is 149.6 million km.

     (a)   Calculate the time, in minutes, it takes for light from the Sun to reach the Earth.                                     [3]

     A light-year is the distance light travels in one year and is equal to 9 467 280 million km.
     Polaris is a bright star, visible from the Northern Hemisphere. The distance from the Earth to
     Polaris is 323 light-years.

     (b)   Find the distance from the Earth to Polaris in millions of km. Give your answer in the
           form a × 10k with 1 ≤ a < 10 and k ∈  .                                                                                [3]

                   The correlation between h and a is positive.

                   The correlation between h and a is negative.

                   There is no correlation between h and a .                                                      [1]

           estimate the number of hours Diogo watches television per week.                                        [1]

8.   In this question, give all answers correct to 2 decimal places.

     Jose travelled from Buenos Aires to Sydney. He used Argentine pesos, ARS, to buy
     350 Australian dollars, AUD, at a bank. The exchange rate was 1 ARS = 0.1559 AUD.

     (a)   Use this exchange rate to calculate the amount of ARS that is equal to 350 AUD.                                       [2]

     The bank charged Jose a commission of 2 %.

     (b)   Calculate the total amount of ARS Jose paid to get 350 AUD.                                                           [2]

     Jose used his credit card to pay his hotel bill in Sydney. The bill was 585 AUD. The value
     the credit card company charged for this payment was 4228.38 ARS. The exchange rate
     used by the credit card company was 1 AUD = x ARS. No commission was charged.

     (c)   Find the value of x .                                                                                                 [2]

9.   Juan buys a bicycle in a sale. He gets a discount of 30 % off the original price and pays
     560 US dollars (USD).

     (a)   Calculate the original price of the bicycle.                                                                             [2]

     To buy the bicycle, Juan takes a loan of 560 USD for 6 months at a nominal annual interest
     rate of 75 %, compounded monthly. Juan believes that the total amount he will pay will be
     less than the original price of the bicycle.

     (b)   Calculate the difference between the original price of the bicycle and the total amount
           Juan will pay.                                                                                                           [4]

13.   Applicants for a job had to complete a mathematics test. The time they took to complete
      the test is normally distributed with a mean of 53 minutes and a standard deviation of 16.3.
      One of the applicants is chosen at random.

      (a)   Find the probability that this applicant took at least 40 minutes to complete the test.                                 [2]

      For 11 % of the applicants it took longer than k minutes to complete the test.

      (b)   Find the value of k .                                                                                                   [2]

      There were 400 applicants for the job.

      (c)   Estimate the number of applicants who completed the test in less than 25 minutes.                                       [2]

15.   Maria owns a cheese factory. The amount of cheese, in kilograms, Maria sells in one
      week, Q , is given by

                                            Q = 882 - 45p ,

      where p is the price of a kilogram of cheese in euros (EUR).

      (a)   Write down how many kilograms of cheese Maria sells in one week if the price of a
            kilogram of cheese is 8 EUR.                                                                                             [1]

      Maria earns ( p - 6.80) EUR for each kilogram of cheese sold.

      (b)   Find how much Maria earns in one week, from selling cheese, if the price of a kilogram
            of cheese is 8 EUR.                                                                                                      [2]

      To calculate her weekly profit W , in EUR, Maria multiplies the amount of cheese she sells by
      the amount she earns per kilogram.

      (c)   Write down an expression for W in terms of p .                                                                           [1]

      (d)   Find the price, p , that will give Maria the highest weekly profit.                                                      [2]
