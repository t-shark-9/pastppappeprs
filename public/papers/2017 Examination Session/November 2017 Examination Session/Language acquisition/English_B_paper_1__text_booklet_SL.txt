          Environmental Effects of Factory Farming
        [ – X – ]  

         We New Zealanders are proud of our clean,
         green image. But our waterways, land and
         reputation are under threat from factory
         farming. Any kind of farming can cause
         environmental damage, but factory farming
         especially has a negative impact on the
         natural environment.

        [ – 19 – ]

         Overcrowded factory farms overwhelm
         local ecosystems, leading to the decrease
         of natural resources. The need to grow large amounts of high-energy feed leads to increasing
         deforestation and soil erosion; and the pollution of water, soil and air in the vicinity by
         agrochemicals and manure is already a huge concern.

        [ – 20 – ]

         Animal waste can be a big problem – just one individual cow produces 15 times more than
         a human! Of course all farmed animals produce waste, but in overcrowded factory farms
         the problem is multiplied. The daily pile-up of excrement can lead to major environmental
         problems. Some farmers use large ponds or lagoons to hold waste, which can overflow into
         waterways. This seeps into ground water and eventually rivers, which could cause waterborne
         diseases if it is consumed.

        Factory farming is counterproductive.

         Raising animals for food is already  [ – X – ]  inefficient, because while animals eat large
         quantities of grain, soybeans, oats and corn, they produce  [ – 26 – ]  small amounts of meat,
         dairy products, or eggs in return. For example, it takes 10 kg of grain to produce 1 kg of meat.
         In a factory farming system this effect is intensified. The modern meat industry also wastes
         a  [ – 27 – ]  unsustainable quantity of water. Furthermore, the worst offenders are the indoor
         meat production factory farms which  [ – 28 – ]  consume water supplies.

        [ – 21 – ]

         The more traditional farms in New Zealand are turned into animal food factories, the weaker our
         “clean, green, 100 % pure” image will become. To maintain and develop our image we need to
         become world leaders, not further expand factory farming. There is a more sustainable future
         for New Zealand, which will give us a competitive edge with increasingly receptive international
         consumers.

         Teen science duo finds that some people work
          better when they have digital “distractions”
         Not everyone is actually distracted by
         electronics and social media. In fact,
         some individuals may get more done
         when their work atmosphere is full of
 5       beeps and buzzes.

         Headphones in, Twitter open,
         cell phones at the ready — that’s how
         many people, especially teens and
         young adults, get their work done
10       these days. But while this so-called
         multitasking may strike many as
         dawdling in disguise, research by a
         pair of high school seniors in Oregon
         says that’s not always the case.

15       The research of Sarayu Caulfield and Alexandra Ulmer, which they’ve worked on as part of their
         school curriculum for the past four years, got them invited to speak at the annual conference of
         the American Academy of Pediatrics this past weekend.

         In their study, 400 adolescents were placed in one of two rooms and were tasked with
         completing basic tests. The first was free of distractions, but the second set of participants
20       were required to listen to music. They were also told they could do anything they wanted on
         their phones and computers, and that they should expect an e-mail and quickly answer it.
         Unsurprisingly, most people did better in the room where they were allowed to focus on just
         the testing. But about 15 % of those tested — those who classified themselves as frequently
         multitasking — actually did better when they had e-mail and music to focus on as well.

25       Caulfield and Ulmer wanted to understand why some people seem adapted to this
         high-frequency attention switching. They believed that some adolescent brains may be
         developing differently to cope with all the new stimuli of the digital world.

         Their findings can’t actually tell us anything about brain development yet, but they highlight just
         how little we know about the human brain — and how our modern experiences are shaping it.
