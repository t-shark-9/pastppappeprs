1.   Cultural diversity

     You are currently on holiday in an English-speaking country, and you are impressed by the ways in

     an English-speaking friend explaining what you have observed and why you are so impressed.


2.   Customs and traditions

     While on a school exchange in an English-speaking country, you attended a conference on the
     difficulties faced by communities trying to maintain customs and traditions in a rapidly changing
     world. Write a diary entry in which you record and reflect on the ideas presented at the event.


3.   Health

     Lack of physical exercise is becoming an increasing problem among students at your school.
     Therefore, the principal of your school has decided to run a campaign to tackle this issue.
     Write a proposal to your principal outlining your ideas for the campaign and explain why they would
     be effective in promoting students to take more exercise.


4.   Leisure

     A famous English-speaking author recently visited your town. The author’s books are very popular
     with young people. As a junior reporter for the local newspaper, you interviewed the author about
     what motivates them to write and why their work appeals to a teenage audience. Write an article
     for the local newspaper based on this interview. Do not simply write the text (transcript) of the
     interview.


5.   Science and technology

     Your English teacher has asked you to give a presentation on the topic: “Advances in science
     can both benefit and damage society”. Write the text of your presentation describing one such
