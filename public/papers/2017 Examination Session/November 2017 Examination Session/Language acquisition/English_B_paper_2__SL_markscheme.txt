Criterion A: Language

• How effectively and accurately does the student use language?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is generally inadequate.
   1–2     A very limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are rarely clear.
           Command of the language is limited and generally ineffective.
   3–4     A limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are sometimes clear.
           Command of the language is generally adequate, despite many inaccuracies.
   5–6     A fairly limited range of vocabulary is used, with many errors.
           Simple sentence structures are usually clear.
           Command of the language is effective, despite some inaccuracies.
   7–8     A range of vocabulary is used accurately, with some errors.
           Simple sentence structures are clear.
           Command of the language is good and effective.
   9–10    A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately, with few significant errors.
           Some complex sentence structures are clear and effective.


Clarification

Word count
At SL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words. Failure to write the minimum
number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under criterion A. The whole text should be taken
into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have few language gaps, and slips or flaws rarely affect meaning.

          The ideas are sometimes irrelevant and/or repetitive.

Criterion C: Format

• How correctly does the student produce the required text type?
• To what extent are the conventions of text types appropriate?

  Marks     Level descriptor
    0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
            The text type is not recognizable.
     1
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are not used.
            The text type is hardly recognizable or is not appropriate.
     2
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are very limited.
     3      The text type is sometimes recognizable and appropriate.
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are limited.
            The text type is generally recognizable and appropriate.
     4
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are evident.
            The text type is clearly recognizable and appropriate.
     5
            Conventions appropriate to the text type are effective and evident.

To gain maximum marks [5], all of the bulleted conventions must be applied.
To gain [3], more than half of the conventions must be applied.

Note: Examiners are reminded that Criterion C bullet points are marking notes, not mark schemes.
Therefore, where one or more bullet points are only partially fulfilled (eg appropriate register
generally used but not consistently, there is an opening salutation but no closing salutation etc),
some credit/recognition may still be given. In such cases, examiners should consider the work
holistically and use their professional judgements, with reference to the criteria, to arrive at the final
marks.

Expected conventions of the text type are as follows:

Question 1: Essay
• will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
• will adopt a suitably serious tone
• will use techniques that enable the reader to follow the arguments easily, eg methodical
  approach
• will have a relevant title
• will have a distinct introduction and conclusion.

Question 2: Letter to the editor
• will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
• will adopt an appropriately serious tone
• will give opinions in an interesting and engaging style
• will include a greeting and a closing salutation
• will refer to the original article/issue raised

Question 3: Leaflet
• will adopt a semi-formal register, with perhaps some flashes of informality
• will have an engaging title
• will have a short introduction and a conclusion
• will identify ideas with format features, eg sub-headings, bullet points, numbering etc
• will include practical aspects of the text type like “contact us”, or a phone number and/or an
  e-mail address.

N.B.: Graphic design as such is not marked

  the end

• will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
• will have a title
• will use a neutral/objective style, eg presents ideas with a personal opinion of the writer
