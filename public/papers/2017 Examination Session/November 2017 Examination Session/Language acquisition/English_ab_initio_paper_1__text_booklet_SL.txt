     UNICEF’S DAY FOR CHANGE
     Part 1

   Day for Change is an appeal by UNICEF to collect change* for our
   work to keep children safe. This special day happens annually and
   this year the theme is children in emergencies.

   Day for Change is for everyone                                                 Do you have change?

   Anyone can take part in Day for Change, including schools, churches, sports groups, employees,
   friends and families.
   The challenge is to collect as much change as you can from around the house, down the sofa or
   in your pockets or anywhere else you can think of! You can involve your friends and colleagues
   or, if you’re a teacher or pupil, why not get your whole school involved in a sporting competition
   or a bake sale?
   Why not download our fundraising leaﬂet and get creative on this Day for Change! You can
   also donate online. This makes your fundraising quick and simple.
   Collect your change between February and May 2017. The big change drop-oﬀ day is on
   Friday 13 May or you can choose another day which is more convenient for you.


     Part 2

   Where will your money go?
   All the change you collect will go directly to our Children’s Emergency Fund to protect children
   aﬀected by emergencies.
   By donating your change today you can help to keep even more children safe from danger
   around the world.
   • £1 can help protect ten children from illnesses such as polio.
   • £6 can help pay for life-saving treatment for a very sick child.
   • £8 can supply high-energy food for a hungry child for one week.
   • £26 can pay for a winter kit for a child, including a hat, scarf, gloves, thermal wear, winter boots,
     underwear and a baby quilt.
   • £54 can provide two families with an emergency hygiene kit including soap and toothpaste.

                      How to learn a language in seven days
    Do you really have to travel to another country to learn a new language? What’s possible in a
     week if you learn a language at home? Two brothers, Pedro and Carlos Fernandez, decided to
     learn English in one week studying eight hours a day. Here are the seven things that the brothers
     learned from their experience.

         Know why you want to learn the language

   The brothers wanted the challenge of learning a language in a week. Then they had to choose the
    language to learn. They chose English because they wanted to get to know the English-speaking
    community in their town.

         [ – 14 – ]
   The brothers decorated their apartment with sticky notes. They used dictionaries and labelled
    everything with the English name. It was impossible to carry out any task, make a coﬀee or turn
    the light switch oﬀ, without ﬁrst seeing at least three diﬀerent words related to this action.

         [ – 15 – ]
   The brothers made continuous little tests for each other. When one brother asked the question
    “How do you say that?” the other brother often was able to answer. At the end of the week the
    brothers used English in their everyday conversations, asking one another if they wanted tea or
    coﬀee, if they were ready to cook dinner or when they were going to leave the house the next day.

         [–X–]
   Pedro and Carlos created some small challenges for themselves in the week. These challenges
    forced them to prepare vocabulary to meet the challenge. On the ﬁrst day, for example, a
    Canadian friend visited them, greeted them in English and complimented them on how quickly
    they had learnt their ﬁrst words and phrases.

         [ – 16 – ]
   The brothers enjoyed the week. They surrounded themselves with the food, the music and the ﬁlms
    of the USA so that when they were relaxing they were also learning. They bought lots of American
    snacks and read the information on the labels about the ingredients and the special oﬀers.

         [ – 17 – ]
   The brothers made frequent comparisons between the languages they understand and English.
    This helped them to remember words.

         Try new ways of learning

   The brothers spent a lot of time reading books and on their computers doing exercises. At other
    times they searched for English speaking radio stations and read reports on American football
    games on the web. They listened to songs while they cooked English food. They even talked
    to themselves!

                                                                 adapted from: www.babbel.com (2017)
