General marking instructions

 These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not
 offered as an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must
 rigidly adhere.
 Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
 Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should be
 rewarded appropriately.

 Of course, some of the points listed will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
 developed.


Instructions générales pour la notation

 Ces remarques sont de simples lignes directrices destinées à aider les examinateurs lors de la
 notation. Elles ne peuvent en aucun cas être considérées comme un ensemble fixe et exhaustif
 de réponses ou d’approches de notation auxquelles les réponses doivent strictement
 correspondre.
 Les idées ou angles valables qui n’ont pas été proposés ici doivent être reconnus et
 récompensés de manière appropriée.
 De même, les réponses qui ne comprennent pas toutes les idées ou approches mentionnées ici
 doivent être récompensées de manière appropriée.

 Naturellement, certains des points mentionnés apparaîtront dans les épreuves les moins bonnes
 mais n’y seront probablement pas développés.


Instrucciones generales para la corrección

 El objetivo de estas notas para los examinadores es servir de directrices para ayudar en la
 corrección. Por lo tanto, no deben considerarse una colección fija y exhaustiva de respuestas y
 enfoques por la que deban regirse estrictamente todas las respuestas.
 Los buenos enfoques e ideas que no se mencionen en las notas para la corrección deben recibir
 el reconocimiento y la valoración que les corresponda.
 De igual manera, las respuestas que no incluyan todas las ideas o los enfoques que se sugieren
 en las notas deben valorarse en su justa medida.

 Por supuesto, algunos de los puntos que se incluyen en las notas aparecerán en exámenes
 más flojos, pero probablemente no se habrán desarrollado.

Text 1

This question asks candidates to analyse a radio address given by William Phelps, an American
educator, literary critic, author and popular speaker, on April 6, 1933.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• identify the likely audience of the radio address from the provenance and internal contextual
  elements
• show some understanding of the specific nature of the text type within its historical, social or
  cultural context
• make some comments characterising the speaker and identify what might be the purpose or
  purposes of his talk
• analyse some of the rhetorical and figurative devices used by Phelps to engage his listening
  audience, specifically: repetition, analogy, simile, metaphor, extended metaphor, enumeration;
  his use of images and his diction; his viewpoint (direct address to the listener, use of personal
  anecdote, literary and cultural allusions, etc.); structure (the organisation of the argument, the
  deductive strategy, syntax, punctuation); the effects of sound devices (repetition, alliteration,
  rhythm); tone and register
• refer to some of the assumptions about the audience that the speaker is making: that the
  listener enjoys reading, has acquired numerous books, has a comfortable living space with
  room for books, etc. Refer to some of the values implied: that owning a book is preferable to
  borrowing one, that books should be “used” and revisited as a measure of self, that books bring
  pleasure on many levels, that books are immortal, that books are a personal link to great
  thinkers of the past, that writers are dependent upon their readers, that reading is a social
  activity, that books are superior to corporeal friends, etc.)

A good to very good analysis may also:

• offer a more perceptive understanding of the contextual elements within the speech that reveal
  characteristics of the author, his purpose(s) and the time and place he is speaking
• offer a more informed understanding of radio broadcasting, the likely radio audience or other
  aspects of the historical, social or cultural context
• comment on the relevance of the talk today, including perhaps a comparison of its effects on
  readers past and present
• offer a more thorough and detailed understanding of the rhetorical and figurative devices used
  by Phelps and how they engage listeners and shape meaning
• offer a more detailed analysis of the assumptions made and the values implied
• consider more closely the clear, logical organization of the speaker’s argument perhaps
  referring to its persuasiveness.

Text 2

This question asks candidates to analyse a “news” web page from DOGO news, an online media
network for students aged 10–14 from 2015

An adequate to good analysis will:

• identify the likely audience of this web page as seen from the provenance material and the
  internal contextual elements
• identify from contextual elements the overall purpose of this web page, recognizing that it is
  likely to be read as part of a school (educational) activity (as seen, for example, by the option for
  either “teacher” or “kids” and the choice of topics to click on)
• analyse some of the linguistic features of the text such as sentence structure, diction, rhetorical
  questions, punctuation, voice and tone
• analyse some of the features of the layout and design of the web page (the world header, the
  highlighting of vocabulary, the use of colour, pictures and other graphics, video, interactive
  elements and links, sidebar options, comprehension questions, vocabulary game, student
  comments, etc) in terms of their attractiveness and accessibility to younger readers
• analyse the educational nature of the web page through the manner in which it is presented:
  direct address to engage the reader, suggested books and comprehension questions (reading
  skills), the integration of vocabulary words within a more informal use of language (language
  skills), the use of a frequency graph (math skills), applied links (research skills), references to
  the UK and other international news (geography/social science), the Oxford Dictionary process,
  visual, listening, and computer skills, etc.
• make some comment on the structure and organization that shows how the news item achieves
  its primary didactic purpose of explaining how and why ‘emoji’ was chosen as word of the year.

A good to very good analysis may also:

• offer a more insightful analysis of contextual elements relating to audience and purpose,
  showing a clear awareness of the text’s educational relevance for both students and teachers
  as well as aspects of its entertainment value
• offer a more detailed analysis of the linguistic features of the news item and the associated
  activities presented, bringing out clearly the ways in which language is used in an engaging way
  that is appropriate to the audience, including perhaps comment on the advertising, the
  references to pet animals or the comments section for example
• offer a more thorough and insightful analysis of the layout and design of the web page, giving a
  convincing account of the ways in which the features of this design might appeal specifically to
  an audience of 10-14 year-olds, referring perhaps to uses of humour (e.g., the ‘tears of joy’ that
  punctuate the news item, the photographic image)
• offer a more sophisticated analysis of text type and subject matter, showing how this web page
  engages students on various educational levels so as to improve both their knowledge and
  understanding of various academic subjects and their related skills
• make more detailed comments about the structure and organization of the news item.
