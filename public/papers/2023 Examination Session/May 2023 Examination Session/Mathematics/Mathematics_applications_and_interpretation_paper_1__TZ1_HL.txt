Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided. Full marks are not necessarily awarded
for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations.
Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example,
if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Carys believes that, on a memory retention test, the mean score of bilingual people (mb) will
     be higher than the mean score of monolingual people (mm). Carys gave a memory retention
     test to a random sample of students in her class. The results are shown in the two tables.

                                                                                  Scores

     Carys performs a one-tailed t-test at a 5 % level of significance. It is assumed that the
     scores are normally distributed and the samples have equal variances.

     In a baseball game, Sakura is the batter standing beside home plate. The ball is thrown
     towards home plate along a path that can be modelled by the following function.

                                               y = -0.045x + 2

     In this model, x is the horizontal distance of the ball from the point the ball is thrown and y is
     the vertical height of the ball above the ground. Both measured in metres.

     The outcome of the throw is called a strike if the height of the ball is between 0.53 m
     and 1.24 m at some point while it travels over home plate. The length of home plate is 0.43 m .

                                                                                   diagram not to scale


                                               path
                                                      of ba
                                                           ll

                                                              a




                       ground                                      home plate

                                                                       0.43

     When the ball reaches the front of home plate, the height of the ball above the ground is
     1.25 m. The height of the ball changes by a metres as the ball travels over the length of
     home plate.

     (a)   (i)	Find the value of a .

           (ii)   Justify why this throw is a strike.                                                      [4]

     On the next throw, Sakura hits the ball towards a wall that is 5 metres high. The horizontal
     distance of the wall from the point where the ball was hit is 96 metres. The path of the ball
     after it is hit can be modelled by the function h (d ) .

                                h (d ) = -0.01d 2 + 1.04d + 0.66 , for h , d > 0

     In this model, h is the height of the ball above the ground and d is the horizontal distance of
     the ball from the point where it was hit. Both h and d are measured in metres.

     (b)   Determine whether the ball will go over the wall. Justify your answer.                          [3]

     On a specific day, the speed of cars as they pass a speed camera can be modelled by a
     normal distribution with a mean of 67.3 km h-1 .

     A speed of 75.7 km h-1 is two standard deviations from the mean.

     It is found that 82 % of cars on this road travel at speeds between p km h-1 and q km h-1 ,

      A shop sells oranges and lemons. The weights of the oranges are assumed to be normally
      distributed with mean 205 grams and standard deviation 5 grams. The weights of the lemons
      are assumed to be normally distributed with mean 105 grams and standard deviation 3 grams.

      Nelia selects 1 orange and 2 lemons at random and independent of each other. Calculate
      the probability that the weight of her orange exceeds the combined weight of her lemons.

      Two AC (alternating current) electrical sources with the same frequencies are combined. The
      voltages from these sources can be expressed as V1 = 6 sin (at + 30°) and V2 = 6 sin (at + 90°) .

      The combined total voltage can be expressed in the form V1 + V2 = V sin (at + q °) .

      Determine the value of V and the value of q .
