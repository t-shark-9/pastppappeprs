Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Daina makes pendulums to sell at a market. She plans to make 10 pendulums on the first
     day and, on each subsequent day, make 6 more than she did the day before.

     (a)   Calculate the number of pendulums she would make on the 12th day.                           [3]

     She plans to make pendulums for a total of 15 days in preparation for going to the market.

     (b)   Calculate the total number of pendulums she would have available at the market.             [2]

     Daina would like to have at least 1000 pendulums available to sell at the market and
     therefore decides to increase her production. She still plans to make 10 pendulums on the
     first day, but on each subsequent day, she will make x more than she did the day before.

     (c)   Given that she will still make pendulums for a total of 15 days, calculate the minimum
           integer value of x required for her to reach her target.                                    [3]

     Daina tests one of her pendulums. She releases the ball at the end of the pendulum to swing
     freely. The point at which she releases it is shown as the initial position on the left side of
     the following diagram. Daina begins recording the distances travelled by the ball after it
     has reached the extreme position, represented by the right-hand side of the diagram.

                                                                             diagram not to scale

     On each successive swing, the distance that the ball travelled was 95 % of its previous
     distance. During the first swing that Daina recorded, the ball travelled a distance of 17.1 cm.
     During the second swing that she recorded, it travelled a distance of 16.245 cm.

     (d)   Calculate the distance that the ball travelled during the 5th recorded swing.                  [3]

     (e)   Calculate the total distance that the ball travelled during the first 16 recorded swings.      [2]

     A scientist is conducting an experiment on the growth of a certain species of bacteria.

     The population of the bacteria, P , can be modelled by the function

                                          P (t) = 1200 × k t , t ≥ 0 ,

     where t is the number of hours since the experiment began, and k is a positive constant.

     (c)   Find the population of the bacteria 1 hour and 30 minutes after the experiment began.       [2]

     The scientist conducts a second experiment with a different species of bacteria.
     The population of this bacteria, S , can be modelled by the function

                                        S (t) = 5000 × 1.65t , t ≥ 0 ,

     where t is the number of hours since both experiments began.

     (d)   Find the value of t when the two populations of bacteria are equal.                         [2]

     It takes 2 hours and m minutes for the number of bacteria in the second experiment to
     reach 19 000.

     The bacteria in the second experiment are growing inside a container. The scientist models
     the volume of each bacterium in the second experiment to be 1 × 10−18 m3 , and the available
     volume inside the container is 2.1 × 10−5 m3 .

     It is claimed that a new remedy cures 82 % of the patients with a particular medical problem.

     This remedy is to be used by 115 patients, and it is assumed that the 82 % claim is true.

     (a)   Find the probability that exactly 90 of these patients will be cured.                        [3]

     A clinic is interested to see if the mean recovery time of their patients who tried the new
     remedy is less than that of their patients who continued with an older remedy. The clinic
     randomly selects some of their patients and records their recovery time in days. The results
     are shown in the table below.
