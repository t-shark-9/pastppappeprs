                                Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M    Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method.

A    Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M
marks.

R    Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

AG   Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.

FT   Follow through. The practice of awarding marks, despite candidate errors in previous
     parts, for their correct methods/answers using incorrect results.


Using the markscheme

1    General

     Award marks using the annotations as noted in the markscheme eg M1, A2.


2    Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

     • Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be
       checked, and marks awarded according to the markscheme.
     • It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the
       preceding M mark(s), if any.
     • Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, e.g. M1A1, this usually means M1
       for an attempt to use an appropriate method (e.g. substitution into a formula) and A1
       for using the correct values.
     • Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded
       independently; so if the first value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award
       A0A1A1.
     • Where the markscheme specifies A3, M2 etc., do not split the marks, unless there is
       a note.
     • The response to a “show that” question does not need to restate the AG line, unless
       a Note makes this explicit in the markscheme.
     • Once a correct answer to a question or part question is seen, ignore further working
       even if this working is incorrect and/or suggests a misunderstanding of the question.
       This will encourage a uniform approach to marking, with less examiner discretion.
       Although some candidates may be advantaged for that specific question item, it is likely
       that these candidates will lose marks elsewhere too.
     • An exception to the previous rule is when an incorrect answer from further working is
       used in a subsequent part. For example, when a correct exact value is followed by
       an incorrect decimal approximation in the first part and this approximation is then used
       in the second part. In this situation, award FT marks as appropriate but do not award
       the final A1 in the first part.
                                                    –4–         M23/5/MATHY/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M

                    decimal value)       question.               working)
2.      35           0.468111…           Yes.                    Award A0 for the final mark
                     (incorrect          Value is used in        (and full FT is available in
        72          decimal value)       subsequent parts.       subsequent parts)


3    Implied marks

     Implied marks appear in brackets e.g. (M1),and can only be awarded if correct work
     is seen or implied by subsequent working/answer.


4    Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)

     Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a
     question is used correctly in subsequent part(s) (e.g. incorrect value from part (a)
     used in part (d) or incorrect value from part (c)(i) used in part (c)(ii)). Usually, to award
     FT marks, there must be working present and not just a final answer based on an
     incorrect answer to a previous part. However, if all the marks awarded in a subsequent
     part are for the answer or are implied, then FT marks should be awarded for their
     correct answer, even when working is not present.

     For example: following an incorrect answer to part (a) that is used in subsequent
     parts, where the markscheme for the subsequent part is (M1)A1, it is possible to
     award full marks for their correct answer, without working being seen. For longer
     questions where all but the answer marks are implied this rule applies but may be
     overwritten by a Note in the Markscheme.

     • Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded
       for work which uses the error, but M marks may be awarded if appropriate.

     • If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to
       award fewer FT marks, by reflecting on what each mark is for and how that maps to
       the simplified version.

     • If the error leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, sin  = 1.5
       , non-integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s) for the final
       answer(s).

     • The markscheme may use the word “their” in a description, to indicate that candidates
       may be using an incorrect value.

     • If the candidate’s answer to the initial question clearly contradicts information given
       in the question, it is not appropriate to award any FT marks in the subsequent parts.
       This includes when candidates fail to complete a “show that” question correctly, and
       then in subsequent parts use their incorrect answer rather than the given value.
                                                  –5–         M23/5/MATHY/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M



    • Exceptions to these FT rules will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.

    • If a candidate makes an error in one part but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent
      part(s), award marks as appropriate, unless the command term was “Hence”.

5   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies values or information from the question, this is a mis-
    read (MR). A candidate should be penalized only once for a particular misread. Use
    the MR stamp to indicate that this has been a misread and do not award the first mark,
    even if this is an M mark, but award all others as appropriate.
    • If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to
      award fewer marks.

    • If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, sin  = 1.5 ,
      non-integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s) for the
      final answer(s).

    • Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.

    • If a candidate uses a correct answer, to a “show that” question, to a higher degree of
      accuracy than given in the question, this is NOT a misread and full marks may be
      scored in the subsequent part.

    • MR can only be applied when work is seen. For calculator questions with no working
      and incorrect answers, examiners should not infer that values were read incorrectly.


6   Alternative methods

    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless
    the question specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with
    the markscheme. If the command term is ‘Hence’ and not ‘Hence or otherwise’ then
    alternative methods are not permitted unless covered by a note in the mark scheme.

    • Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1,
      METHOD 2, etc.
    • Alternative solutions for parts of questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
                                                    –6–          M23/5/MATHY/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


7   Alternative forms
    Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

    • As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation for
      example 1.9 and 1,9 or 1000 and 1,000 and 1.000 .

    • Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, M marks and
      intermediate A marks can be scored, when presented using calculator notation,
      provided the evidence clearly reflects the demand of the mark.

    • In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be
      written in brackets immediately following the answer.

    • In the markscheme, some equivalent answers will generally appear in brackets. Not
      all equivalent notations/answers/methods will be presented in the markscheme and
      examiners are asked to apply appropriate discretion to judge if the candidate work is
      equivalent.


8   Format and accuracy of answers

    If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be linked to giving the
    answer to the required accuracy. If the level of accuracy is not stated in the question,
    the general rule applies to final answers: unless otherwise stated in the question all
    numerical answers must be given exactly or correct to three significant figures.

    Where values are used in subsequent parts, the markscheme will generally use the
    exact value, however candidates may also use the correct answer to 3 sf in
    subsequent parts. The markscheme will often explicitly include the subsequent values
    that come “from the use of 3 sf values”.

    Simplification of final answers: Candidates are advised to give final answers using
    good mathematical form. In general, for an A mark to be awarded, arithmetic should
    be completed, and any values that lead to integers should be simplified; for example,
      25                     5
         should be written as . An exception to this is simplifying fractions, where
      4                      2
    lowest form is not required (although the numerator and the denominator must be
                              10                                       5           10
    integers); for example,      may be left in this form or written as . However,
                               4                                       2            5
    should be written as 2, as it simplifies to an integer.

    Algebraic expressions should be simplified by completing any operations such as
    addition and multiplication, e.g. 4e2 x  e3 x should be simplified to 4e5 x , and
    4e2 x  e3 x − e4 x  e x should be simplified to 3e5 x . Unless specified in the question,
    expressions do not need to be factorized, nor do factorized expressions need to be
    expanded, so x ( x + 1) and x 2 + x are both acceptable.

    Please note: intermediate A marks do NOT need to be simplified.

9     Calculators

      A GDC is required for this paper, but if you see work that suggests a candidate has
      used any calculator not approved for IB DP examinations (eg CAS enabled devices),
      please follow the procedures for malpractice.


10.   Presentation of candidate work

      Crossed out work: If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination
      script, or in some other way crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that
      work unless an explicit note from the candidate indicates that they would like the work
      to be marked.

      More than one solution: Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to
      the same question, an examiner should only mark the first response unless the
      candidate indicates otherwise. If the layout of the responses makes it difficult to judge,
      examiners should apply appropriate discretion to judge which is “first”.
