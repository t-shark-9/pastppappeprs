Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page. Full
marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported
by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part
of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided
this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

         The depth of water, w metres, in a particular harbour can be modelled by the
         function w (t ) =a cos (bt) + d where t is the length of time, in minutes, after 06:00.

         On 20 January, the first high tide occurs at 06:00, at which time the depth of water is 18 m .
         The following low tide occurs at 12:15 when the depth of water is 4 m . This is shown in
         the diagram.

     A large international sports tournament tests their athletes for banned substances.
     They interpret a positive test result as meaning that the athlete uses banned substances.
     A negative result means that they do not.

     The probability that an athlete uses banned substances is estimated to be 0.06 .

     If an athlete uses banned substances, the probability that they will test positive is 0.71 .

     If an athlete does not use banned substances, the probability that they will test negative is 0.98 .

     The sample mean number of sightings per week for this data is 1.76 .

     (a)   Calculate the unbiased estimate of the population variance of sightings per week.                 [3]

     Goran believes that the data follows a Poisson distribution.

     (b)   State why your answer to part (a) supports Goran’s belief.                                        [1]

     Goran decides to test at the 5 % significance level to see if his belief is correct.

     His null hypothesis is X ~ Po (m) , where the random variable, X , is defined as the number of
     sightings per week.
