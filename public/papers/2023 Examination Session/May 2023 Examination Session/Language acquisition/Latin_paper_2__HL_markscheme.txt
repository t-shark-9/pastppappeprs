               and his colleagues

             • reminders of lost rights (tribunicium auxilium, provocationem plebi
               Romanae, 7–8) whips up the crowd’s support

               inexorable opposition

             • alliteration of /v/ (Verginius viderit ubi venerit, 12–13) suggests that it is safe
               to leave matters with Verginius
             • the comparison vita quam fides (14) shows his determination to succeed

Instructions
Section B is assessed by the assessment criteria found below and published in the subject guide.

Criterion A (Range of evidence) assesses to what extent the evidence represents both prescribed
passages and supplementary reading. A candidate is expected to:
• use relevant examples from the prescribed passages to support the response (candidates are not
   expected to provide exact quotes)
• demonstrate knowledge of historical, political and cultural contexts beyond those embedded in the
   prescribed passages.

Criterion B (Understanding and argument) assesses how well the response demonstrates understanding
of the chosen option. Ideally, a candidate will:
• build a critical analysis that responds directly to the prompt in a clear, logical and imaginative way
• fully address the contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples related to the chosen
    option.
