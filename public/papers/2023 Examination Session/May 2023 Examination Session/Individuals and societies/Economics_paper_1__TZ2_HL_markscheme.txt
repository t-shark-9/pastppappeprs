Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

1.     (a)   Explain why products may have different income elasticities of demand.                    [10]

              Answers may include:
             • Terminology: income elasticity of demand (YED)
             • Explanation: that a positive YED is where an increase in income leads to an
                increase in demand/a decrease in income leads to a decrease in demand and
                that this is associated with normal goods; that a negative YED is where an
                increase in income leads to a decrease in demand/a decrease in income leads
                to an increase in demand and that is associated with inferior goods; that some
                goods may have a high income elasticity of demand (ie income elastic) and
                some may have a low income elasticity of demand (ie income inelastic).
             • Diagram: demand and supply diagram showing relevant shifts of demand,
                Engel curve.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one aspect of the question is
             addressed.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the assumption that consumers always seek
      to maximize their utility.                                                         [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: utility.
      • Explanation: of the assumption in terms of consumer rationality, perfect
        information and the maximization of total utility.
      • Diagram: not needed for this question.
      • Synthesis (discuss): a challenge to the assumption in terms of the limitations
        to rational consumer choice such as imperfect information, bounded
        rationality, bounded selfishness, biases – rule of thumb, anchoring and
        framing, availability; consideration of the word “always”.
      • Examples: real-world examples of consumers acting rationally or where there
        are limitations to their ability to do so.

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: unemployment.
             • Explanation: of any two economic costs such as a loss of real output; higher
               spending and lower tax revenues for the government with the possibility of a
               larger budget deficit/ a smaller budget surplus; a more unequal distribution of
               income; costs to the government of dealing with social problems caused by
               unemployment; unemployed people may have difficulty finding work in the
               future; specific problems related to the type of unemployment, eg structural or
               cyclical.
             • Diagram: any relevant diagram related to the particular cost being explained,
               eg use of a PPC diagram or an AD/AS diagram.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the view that low unemployment can only be
      achieved at the expense of higher inflation.                                        [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: unemployment, inflation.
      • Explanation: of the view in terms of higher AD as unemployment falls and thus
        higher demand inflation and/or in terms of the short-run Phillips curve
        relationship.
      • Diagram: use of an AD/AS diagram, a short-run Phillips curve diagram and/or
        a long-run Phillips curve diagram
      • Synthesis (discuss): a challenge to the view in terms of the importance of the
        type of unemployment being tackled, eg structural or cyclical, and the way in
        which it is tackled, eg through the use of demand-side or supply-side policies;
        Monetarist/new classical perspectives versus Keynesian perspectives; the
        possibility of higher inflation and higher unemployment; the possibility of no
        negative stable relationship between unemployment and inflation using the
        long-run Phillips curve; consideration of the importance of technological
        progress; consideration of the word “only”.
      • Examples: real-world examples of situations where low unemployment may or
        may not have coincided with higher inflation; use of empirical evidence.

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the view that market-based policies may

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: market-based policy, economic development.
      • Explanation: of the view in terms of what market-based policies are, eg trade
        liberalization, privatization and deregulation and why such policies might be
        ineffective; eg limited benefits for export growth and diversification, the
        creation of a variety of market failures, limited effects on economic growth, the
        creation of winners and losers, increasing income inequalities and poverty,
        problems of foreign ownership of privatized utilities, the benefits of
        interventionist policies.
      • Diagram: use of a PPC diagram and/or an AD/AS diagram.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): a challenge to the view in terms of such benefits of
        market-based policies as greater competition and consumer choice, greater
        efficiency and productivity, an increase in the productive potential of
        economies, greater economic growth and thus development and an
        improvement in the allocation of resources.

           • Economic terms are stated but they are not relevant.
           • The response contains no evidence of synthesis or evaluation.
           • A real-world example(s) is identified but it is irrelevant.

   4–6     • The response indicates some understanding of the specific demands of the question.
           • Relevant economic theory is described.
           • Some relevant economic terms are included.
           • The response contains evidence of superficial synthesis or evaluation.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified.

   7–9     • The response indicates understanding of the specific demands of the question,
             but these demands are only partially addressed.
           • Relevant economic theory is partly explained.
           • Some relevant economic terms are used appropriately.
           • Where appropriate, relevant diagram(s) are included.
           • The response contains evidence of appropriate synthesis or evaluation but
             lacks balance.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified and partly developed in the context of
