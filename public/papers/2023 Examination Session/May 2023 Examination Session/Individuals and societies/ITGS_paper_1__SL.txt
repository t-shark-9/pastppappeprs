Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Intelligent transport monitoring

     The government of the Republic of Uganda has required all motor vehicles to be fitted with a
     global positioning system (GPS) device. The government has adopted this strategy to reduce
     crimes that often involve the use of motor vehicles. Figure 1 shows that a GPS device can
     be hidden inside a car.

                         Figure 1: How the transport monitoring system works




                           Monitoring centre




                                       ABC 1234
           Car number plate                    5




                                                                          GPS device hidden
                                                                          inside the car


     The GPS device within the vehicle will communicate with a monitoring centre to send the
     data from the car using mobile/cellphone technology. If the device is disconnected from the
     vehicle, an alert will be sent to the monitoring centre.

     In addition to the information captured by the GPS device, there are roadside cameras that
     capture images of the number plates of passing cars.

     This initiative is called the Intelligent Transport Monitoring System (ITMS).

     However, civil liberty groups in the Republic of Uganda have raised concerns about the
     Intelligent Transport Monitoring System.

     (a)   (i)     State two file formats that could be used for the images of car number plates.            [2]

           (ii)    Identify two pieces of information, in addition to the location of the vehicle, that
                   could be communicated from a vehicle to the monitoring centre.                            [2]

           (iii)   The government is considering using the data from the Intelligent Transport
                   Monitoring System (ITMS) to create a model of the traffic patterns in a city.

                   Identify two factors that should be taken into account when developing this model. [2]

(This question continues on the following page)
                                                     –3–                                        2223 – 5512


(Question 1 continued)

     (b)   (i)	The government also wants to use the Intelligent Transport Monitoring System
                (ITMS) to produce a simulation of traffic patterns.

                   Explain one benefit of producing a simulation of traffic patterns.                  [2]

           The Ugandan government is outsourcing the development of the Intelligent Transport
           Monitoring System (ITMS) to a technology company in another country. This company
           will also develop and operate the software that monitors vehicles in the system (ITMS).

           (ii)    Explain one advantage of outsourcing the development and operation of the
                   Intelligent Transport Monitoring System (ITMS) to a company in another country.     [2]

           (iii)   Explain one disadvantage of outsourcing the development and operation of the
                    Intelligent Transport Monitoring System (ITMS) to a company in another country.    [2]

     (c)   Discuss whether the advantages for the government of monitoring the movement of
           vehicles in the Republic of Uganda outweigh the disadvantages.                              [8]




                                                                                                Turn over

2.   EyesOnU

     EyesOnU is a facial recognition website that allows people to upload a picture of a person
     and find matching images on the World Wide Web. Each image found is given a rating based
     on how similar it is to the uploaded picture (see Figure 2).

     EyesOnU is marketed as an online tool that allows a user to see if somebody else has used
     an image that includes them without their permission.

     EyesOnU aims to encourage its users to behave ethically.

     EyesOnU stores the data in a relational database (see Figure 3).

                                                    –5–                                               2223 – 5512


(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)     State the primary key in the Users table in Figure 3.[1]

           (ii)    State the relationship between the Users table and Images table in Figure 3.[1]

           (iii)   Identify two reasons for using a relational database to store this information.           [2]

           (iv)    Describe the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web.                      [2]

     (b)   The EyesOnU facial recognition tool has drawn criticism from privacy campaigners who
           say that the tool could be used to compromise a user’s privacy. EyesOnU has stated
           that their privacy policy will prevent this.

           Explain three rules that could be included in a privacy policy for EyesOnU.[6]

     (c)   There have been concerns raised about the way people use facial recognition sites
           like EyesOnU.

           To what extent is it the responsibility of the website owners and the users of EyesOnU
           to ensure that users act ethically?                                                               [8]

3.   Fake news

     In 2021, 96 % of Brazilians with access to a smartphone used free internet messaging apps
     as their only method of communication and obtaining news (see Figure 4).

                 Figure 4: An example of a smartphone with a free messaging app

     However, these messaging apps are leading to the spread of false information. This is
     because messages are often forwarded many times, especially when users are using
     messaging groups that allow messages to be shared between several people. These
     forwarded messages may not have been written by a member of the group. Being able to
     check whether the information in the messages is true can be very difficult.

     One of the issues that has arisen as a result of false information being spread by such
     groups is that people in communities far from large towns are refusing medical treatment
     (such as vaccinations against preventable diseases).

     The messaging app company has said that, because the messages on its platform are
     encrypted, there is nothing it can do to remove messages containing false information
     (see Figure 5).

     (a)   (i)    State two output devices on a smartphone.                                                [2]

           (ii)   Identify the steps used in public and private key encryption.                            [4]

     (b)   It has been proposed that the following measures could be introduced to reduce the
           risk of users spreading false information:
           y Limiting the size of messaging app groups.
           y Limiting the number of times a message can be forwarded.
           y Labelling messages as being forwarded.

     (c)   To what extent is it the responsibility of the individuals within these communities to
           address the issue of false information being spread on social media?                            [8]

4.     Jack’s fitness business

       Jack Chevremont is a personal trainer in Massachusetts, USA. For the last few years he has
       been providing fitness sessions for clients at home. Jack has grown his business based on
       personal recommendations.

       Jack is considering expanding his business. He has been advised to develop a website to
       advertise to prospective clients. This website would also allow clients to book their fitness
       sessions online.

       (a)    Jack’s website has the following URL: https://www.jacksfitnessservices.com

              (i)     State the domain name.                                                                                    [1]

              (ii)    State the protocol.                                                                                       [1]

              One of Jack’s clients has advised him to use cookies and meta tags.

              (iii)   Identify two reasons why Jack’s website would use cookies.                                                [2]

              (iv)    Identify two reasons why Jack’s website would include meta tags.                                          [2]

       (b)    Jack keeps the records of his financial transactions with clients in a spreadsheet.

              Explain three advantages for Jack of keeping financial transactions with clients in a
              spreadsheet rather than in a database.                                                                            [6]

       (c)    Jack’s business has recently suffered because he can’t always visit his clients in their
              homes. He is considering changing to personal training via a video-streaming platform.

              Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages for Jack if he offers personal training via
              a video-streaming platform instead of travelling to visit his clients in person.                                  [8]
