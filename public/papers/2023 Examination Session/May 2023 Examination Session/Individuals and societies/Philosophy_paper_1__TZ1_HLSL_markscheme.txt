How to use the Diploma Programme Philosophy markscheme

The assessment markbands constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment markbands examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the assessment markbands listed on page 6 for the core theme and
page 9 for the optional themes.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to
emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills referred to in the various
assessment markbands published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement with philosophical
activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing responses, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme:

• The Diploma Programme Philosophy course is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy
  in the candidates. These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment markbands in the
  subject guide
• The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct answer
• The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
• The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list but rather an indicative list where they might appear in the answer
• If there are names of philosophers and references to their work incorporated into the markscheme,
  this should help to give context for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such
  philosophers and references should appear in an answer: they are possible lines of development.
• Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
• Examiners should be aware of the command terms for Philosophy as published on page 54 of the
  Philosophy subject guide when assessing responses
• In Paper 1, examiners must be aware that a variety of types of answers and approaches, as well as a
  freedom to choose a variety of themes, is expected. Thus, examiners should not penalize different
  styles of answers or different selections of content when candidates develop their response to the
  questions. The markscheme should not imply that a uniform response is expected
• In markschemes for the core theme questions in Paper 1 (section A) the bullet points suggest
  possible routes of response to the stimulus, but it is critical for examiners to understand that the
  selection of the philosophical issue raised by the stimulus is entirely at the choice of the candidate so
  it is possible for material to gain credit from the examiner even if none of the material features in the
  markscheme.


Note to examiners

Candidates at both Higher Level and Standard Level answer one question on the core theme (Section A).
Candidates at Higher Level answer two questions on the optional themes (Section B), each based on a
different optional theme.
Candidates at Standard Level answer one question on the optional themes (Section B).

1.   With explicit reference to the stimulus and your own knowledge, discuss a
     philosophical issue related to the question of what it means to be human.                          [25]
     The following paragraph and discussion points provide only a framework to help examiners in
     their assessment of responses to this question. Examiners should be responsive to a variety of
     philosophical perspectives and approaches. Examiners should be aware that candidates might
     respond to this passage in a variety of ways including ones not mentioned in the summary below.
     This question requires candidates to identify and discuss philosophical issues and/or concepts in
     the image related to the fundamental question of what it is to be human. Responses are likely to
     use the image to discuss issues of what the human being comprises. Candidates might discuss
     the relationship between physical and psychological aspects in shaping human identity and whether a
     knowledge of the self is possible. Moreover, candidates might identify the concept of
     consciousness, whether such a thing exists, and how it relates to mind and body. Therefore,
     responses might analyse the idea of dualism in terms of mind-body theories, eg those of
     Descartes or Popper. Candidates might also discuss the nature of mind and whether it is a material
     substance and material processes or not. Responses might consider the role of emotions in knowing
     the self and the surrounding world and whether they contrast reason and logical thinking. Candidates
     might focus on the processes of shaping identity and personality and the role that experiences play
     in it, by making each person become a unique individual: are there common innate elements that
     make all people similar or can individuals differentiate from each other? Responses might consider the
     consequences of technological progress in shaping human identity and modifying the way we see
     ourselves and others. Another path that candidates might follow concerns the concept of will: do
     humans have free will or do their mind-body structure and the influence of technology make
     determinism the only possible ontological background? Another element that responses might
     present is related to bioethical issues, eg how technological development in medicine changes the
     definition of human beings in certain situations: end-of-life care, euthanasia, and coma. Finally,
     candidates might consider the differences between human identity and artificial intelligence and
     whether its progress can move us towards identity issues in computers and robotics.
     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Who am I?
     • Is there such a thing as the self?
     • Is it possible to know oneself?
     • What is the role played by emotions and reason in knowing the self and the surrounding world?
        eg Nussbaum’s and Damasio’s theories on emotions, neurosciences, philosophy of mind
     • Does consciousness exist and how does it relate to human mind and body?
     • Mind-body theories, eg Descartes, Popper
     • Is the mind made of material processes or not? eg Plato, Descartes, Dewey, James.
     • What is the role played by experience in shaping individuals? Are there common, innate
        qualities? Can individuals differentiate from each other?
     • Is identity construction dependent upon cultural or natural elements?
     • Free will versus determinism
     • Can material conditions in which we live be overlooked?
     • How fixed/malleable is human nature?
     • Why do we believe that other people have minds like ours?
     • Can the process of self-knowledge be the source of existential angst?
     • Is it possible to know the other? Is it possible to ethically judge it?
     • The shaping of identity as part of a general, basic human need for organizing the self and the
        world
     • The role of technology in shaping human identity, eg television, the Internet, social networks
     • The construction of a social self versus the individual self
     • New ways of understanding and defining “the self” according to technological developments,
        eg bioethical issues arising from medical progress: end-of-life care, euthanasia, and coma.

2.   With explicit reference to the stimulus and your own knowledge, discuss a
     philosophical issue related to the question of what it means to be human.                           [25]

     The following paragraphs provide only a framework to help examiners in their assessment of
     responses to this question. Examiners should be responsive to a variety of philosophical
     perspectives and approaches. Examiners should be aware that candidates might respond to this
     passage in a variety of ways including ones not mentioned in the summary below.

     This question requires candidates to identify and discuss philosophical issues and/or concepts in
     the picture related to the fundamental question of what it is to be human. The drawing of a family
     presents the nuclear starting point of the relation between human beings and triggers a series of
     questions connected to the relation between the self and the other as being constitutive of the
     human condition. Responses are likely for example to focus on some of the possible approaches
     to family. A metaphysical approach draws on the commands of a deity or the needs of a nation.
     A biological approach appeals to physical resemblance, blood or genes. An economic approach
     focuses on family property, income, division of work and resources, and inheritance. A related
     political approach attends to power, subordination, and rights within a family, as well as to their
     regulation by the state. A psychological approach takes affection, identification, intimacy, and
     emotional needs as morally decisive. A narrative approach makes recalling and revision of family
     stories the basis of moral education and the definition of family ties. Responses could also refer to
     more general issues involved in the social dimensions of the human life, eg civil society, political
     contract or conceptions of human nature. This could include discussion of issues such as
     individuality and universality, the opposition between freedom and determinism, or focus on issues
     such as identity and personhood, exploring questions in relation to social and cultural identity.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Interpretations of the human condition: Biological and social necessities; social conditioning
     • Solipsism and intersubjectivity
     • Is how we interact with others what makes us human?
     • A human being is a social creature, because essential human capacities and aims are
        completely fulfilled only in a human community
     • The individual’s well-being or happiness must involve the good of fellow members of a
        community
     • Contrast between traditional, various cultural interpretations of family, and modern
        understanding of the concept of family
     • Family as a group of individuals compared to clans and tribes
     • Philosophical views, eg Plato, Rousseau, Mill, de Beauvoir
     • For Confucius the life of every human being is played out within the context of his or her
        particular family, for better or for worse. It is one’s family and the complex of relationships that
        constitute it; one is one’s roles and relationships
     • Many other species are described as possessing a social way of life. However, human society
        would go beyond mere gregariousness, cooperation or some form of order or division of labour
     • Ways in which human society is characterized: Social action, or interaction, in terms of the
        particular kinds of awareness it involves; social order as a form of order that arises
        spontaneously when rational and mutually aware individuals succeed in solving coordination
        problems; the role played by communication in achieving collective agreement on the way the
        world is to be classified and understood, as a precondition of coordination and cooperation
     • We depend on others when learning language; it helps us perform various social functions and
        many of its uses have become institutionalized.

                                             Section B
Optional theme 1: Aesthetics

3.   Evaluate the claim that works of art are like flowers: we can enjoy them without
     knowing about soil, air, moisture, and seeds.                                                  [25]

     The claim is from Dewey’s work Art as Experience and invites an analysis of the meaning of art
     and of an art experience. Dewey states that an individual can experience and enjoy an object while
     ignoring what is behind it, but the object cannot be totally understood. Candidates might consider
     the role of emotions in experiencing art and, in general, in experiencing and knowing the world
     around us. In doing so, candidates might mention Damasio’s view on emotions. Candidates might
     explore the nature of knowledge in terms of rationality versus emotions or as a combination of
     those elements. Candidates might refer to Pascal’s distinction between esprit de finesse and
     esprit de géométrie. Some responses might pinpoint the impossibility of communicating everything,
     particularly in the field of feeling and interiority; language has its own limits, eg: Wittgenstein.
     Another possible pathway might focus on the role of the passions, as a source of knowledge or as
     a distortion of it, eg: Descartes, Spinoza. Candidates might consider the role of rationality within
     Plato’s view of the tripartite soul, or the role of opinion in his theory of the Divided Line. Some
     responses might highlight the importance of knowing the technique behind art production and in
     order to formulate complete aesthetic judgments, eg: Croce. The concept of taste and the different
     views on it, eg: Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, might be a topic that candidates might want to discuss.
     Reference to intuitionism, eg: Shaftesbury, Gehlen, might be considered by some candidates.
     Finally, candidates might explore whether technology has changed the fruition of art and has
     increased the knowledge and understanding of it or has compromised its “aura” eg: Benjamin.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Whether the aesthetic knowledge and understanding of the work of art are necessary in order to
        have an art experience
     • Works of art as technique and knowledge, eg: Plato, Aristotle, Croce
     • The role of emotions in art and/or in knowing the world, eg: Hume, Damasio
     • Whether language can express all the content of an experience, eg: Dewey, Wittgenstein
     • Knowledge as a combination of rationality and emotion, eg: Pascal, Damasio
     • The role of the passions in human understanding, eg: Hume, Descartes, Spinoza
     • The role of intuition in grasping essential elements of the understanding in diverse fields, such
        as logic, morals, and art, eg: Shaftesbury, Gehlen
     • The views on taste as a personal judgment or as a reference to objective elements, eg: Hume,
        Kant, Nietzsche
     • Whether technology has changed the fruition and understanding of art or has contributed to
        make it lose its “aura”, eg: Benjamin.
                                                   –9–                   M23/3/PHILO/BP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


4.   Evaluate the claim that art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which
     to shape it.                                                                                         [25]

     The claim invites an exploration of the meaning of art and the nature of its end as a creative
     process. Candidates might discuss the creative goal of art versus imitation: reference to Aristotle’s
     difference between poiesis and mimesis might be taken into account. According to Plato and
     Aristotle, art is basically imitation of reality and possession of technical skills; for Croce and Dewey,
     instead, art is not only grounded in technical knowledge but also in the creative spirit of the artist.
     Candidates might also consider that historically art has been used as a means of propaganda, as
     during Fascism, or to self-affirm the power of an authority, as in the case of a pope or a prince
     acting as a patron. Candidates might mention the views of art as a social means to deliver values,
     such as beauty, eg: Dewey, or present views that contrast the idea that art has to have a social
     function, eg: Croce. Responses might take into account the role of censorship and the freedom of
     the artist as a key value of his/her activity. The claim holds a view of art as a means to break the
     status quo: candidates might refer to the concept of conformity that modern society has fostered.
     Particularly, candidates might explore the ideas of the Frankfurt School on the cultural industry,
     eg: Horkheimer, Adorno. Another possible pathway is the role of images in modern society, from
     Debord’s view of the society of the spectacle to the most recent use of images on the social media,
     eg: selfies and memes. Candidates might evaluate whether technology contributes to shape art
     more as a hammer or more as a mirror; replicability of the works of art seems to undermine their
     “aura”, eg: Benjamin. Candidates might consider the essential function of art as that of shaking the
     common sense, so freeing art from any ethical judgment. Candidates might consider the potential
     of art in creating “new” realities, eg: Baudrillard’s “hyper-real”, or as in virtual reality, eg: Deleuze,
     Lévy. Finally, responses might discuss whether art has a function, eg: catharsis, or whether art is
     for art’s sake.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Art as creation versus imitation of reality, eg: Aristotle’s mimesis
     • The role of art: political uses, eg: propaganda and censorship
     • Possible social uses of art, eg: Dewey’s view of art as a means of civilization
     • Whether art’s mission is to break social habits and conformity
     • Whether art has an end, eg: catharsis, or is an end in itself
     • Whether art can have a social function, eg: Croce
     • Art production and cultural industry: conformity, eg: the Frankfurt School
     • The role of images in modern society, eg: Debord
     • Whether technology fosters creativity or conformity in art, eg: Benjamin
     • Art as a means to create a new reality, eg: Baudrillard
     • Art and virtual reality, eg: Deleuze, Lévy.

Optional theme 2: Epistemology

5.   Explain and discuss the role of what other people tell us in knowledge development.                 [25]

     A large body of the knowledge that we acquire is via testimony. This means that we are told it by
     others. As children, our parents tell us about the world, and then at school teachers continue the
     process. Much of what we learn is through the testimony of others, making it an important source
     of knowledge. This extends to the testimony of experts who inform us about specialist areas of
     knowledge such as the natural sciences or the economy. The prevalence of testimony raises
     questions about whether beliefs acquired via testimony are justified, and the conditions for them to
     be justified. Candidates might discuss the justification of beliefs. Coherentist theories about
     justification might hold that testimony is justified if it coheres with other beliefs. Foundationalists
     might question whether an individual has the appropriate foundations for their beliefs. Alternatively,
     perhaps a belief can be justified if it is founded on someone else’s justification for it. It seems that
     we have to make judgements about the person providing the testimony, including about their
     character and the nature of their expertise. Since our judgments are not always fair, some have
     highlighted the possibility of testimonial injustice, eg: Miranda Fricker argues that women are more
     likely to have their testimony ignored. The epistemological issues raised by testimony include how
     to ascribe authority to someone. This might be related to recent issues concerning the rise of
     misinformation on social media platforms. Another issue is the social nature of knowledge
     acquisition. Since much of the knowledge that we learn comes from other people, how should we
     assess whether it is justified? Candidates might consider the relationship between empiricism and
     testimony; if knowledge is said to come from experience, then how should we view second-hand
     knowledge? Issues such as trust, authority, expertise and bias might also be discussed.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:

     •   Empiricism and whether knowledge has to come from one’s own experience
     •   Education and testimony
     •   Examples where testimony is particularly important, eg: religious experiences
     •   The role of experts and testimony
     •   The puzzles raised by much of our knowledge which is not first-hand, eg: that the earth is
         round. We all know this, but we do not have first-hand evidence of it ourselves, we trust the
         testimony of experts instead
     •   How we justify believing testimony
     •   The difference between testimony and anecdote and whether we are ever justified in believing
         anecdotes
     •   How we ascribe authority to individuals
     •   Ad Hominem arguments and how they relate to authority
     •   Issues like epistemic injustice where we unfairly ascribe or fail to ascribe authority to people
         based on non-epistemic criteria such as gender or race
     •   The difference between empirical evidence and testimonial evidence
     •   Whether something we have been told by an authority counts as a justified, true belief
     •   Whether we have any knowledge which is not in some way the result of testimony
     •   The social nature of knowledge
     •   The view that knowledge comes from human inquiry which takes place over time and relies on
         social institutions, eg: Peirce’s The Fixation of Belief
     •   Whether empiricists could account for the place of testimony in knowledge acquisition,
         eg: Hume
     •   Searle’s ideas about social ontology
     •   The relationships between social institutions and belief formation
     •   Whether rationalists recognize testimony. It seems that while philosopher Kings must reach
         knowledge themselves, their subjects are expected to accept their testimonial authority,
         eg: Plato.

6.   To what extent is the world as it appears?                                                        [25]

     Whether or not the world is as it appears is a classical question in epistemology. Plato’s Republic
     uses the analogy of the cave to explore the idea that the world of appearances is removed from
     reality. In Plato’s view, truth is found in the world of forms and can be reached through a careful
     dialectical process. Our ordinary ideas about the world are mere opinion. On the other hand,
     empiricism holds that our knowledge of the world is derived from experience. Logical positivists
     hold that sense data underlies all knowledge claims. For example, Frank Ramsay sets out a
     system for translating scientific theories into their primary language of statements about sense
     data, or experience. On the other hand, radical skepticism holds that the world may not be as it
     appears, and that we have no way of knowing whether it is or not. Descartes asks us to imagine
     that we might be dreaming, or that we might be being tricked by an evil demon. Since we have no
     way of knowing whether or not this is the case, Descartes questions whether the world is as it
     appears, and so whether we have any knowledge at all. Similarly, contemporary philosophers ask
     us to imagine that we might be a brain in a vat, fed experiences which are indistinguishable from
     reality, but where the world is very different from what we perceive.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Radical skepticism: the idea that we cannot know anything and that the world might be radically
        different from how it appears
     • Empiricism and the idea that our knowledge comes from our experiences
     • Logical positivism which attempts to reduce all knowledge claims to sense-experience data
     • Rationalism which denies the primacy of experience when it comes to knowledge
     • Thought experiments such as the Brain in the Vat which explore whether our experiences
        represent reality
     • Plato’s cave analogy which suggests that the world of appearances is a shadow of reality
     • The extent to which theories, eg: scientific theories, describe the world as it truly appears or are
        merely tools for navigating reality
     • Reference to indirect and direct realism, alongside anti-realism.

Optional theme 3: Ethics

7.   To what extent could it be argued that what is best is what is right?                             [25]

     This is a question that offers different options for its response. Some answers may judge it to be
     narrowly focused on Utilitarianism, which would provide a broad means for responding to the
     question, others might take a more meta-ethical approach. Objections to equating right with best
     include GE Moore’s naturalistic fallacy, which attempts to deny the possibility of a natural quality in
     the world being described as morally good. Other answers might seek to explore how a term like
     “best” might stand up to an analysis by supporters of deontological approaches to ethics. Kant
     ends up using God as a means of guaranteeing the efficacy of his duty-based system, which offers
     a sense that “God knows best and will achieve the best outcome in the fullness of time”.
     Supporters of Virtue Ethics approaches also look at outcomes over time, and with the assumption
     that the good for humans lies in eudaimonia, so there is a sense that adopting habits of virtue is for
     the best. Some responses might look at the standpoint of how to judge “right” or “best” and develop
     ideas about subjectivism and the limitations of ethical language. Can what is deemed right by the
     individual be a basis for ethics? Psychological or biological theories and economic theories could
     be discussed.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Teleological normative ethical theories like Utilitarianism and Virtue Ethics
     • The notion of “best”
     • The notion of “right”
     • Duty-based normative theories which deny a role for considering effect in ethical decision-
        making
     • Casuistry in ethics and whether focusing on technical details is worthwhile
     • Legalism
     • The connection of natural properties in the world (like pleasure) to “best”
     • The naturalistic fallacy, eg: GE Moore
     • Knowledge of what is right – is there a role for intuition?
     • Divine command approaches to ethics
     • Subjectivism and relativism in determining “best” or “right”
     • Can science help determine what is best? Is Psychology the new basis for moral
        understanding?
     • The challenges for a global society of determining “best” or “right”, including the scope of
        international laws and a universal understanding of human rights.

8.   Evaluate the claim that moral language has no special basis on which it can be judged
     to be true or not.                                                                    [25]

     This is a question on the origin and meaning of moral and ethical (which for this question can be
     assumed to refer to the same area of human knowledge) language. Is there a discrete way that
     moral language works, or is the attempt to use it in such a way an error, as purported, for example,
     by JL Mackie? For defenders of the meaningfulness of moral language there are different ways to
     support that meaningfulness. You can accept that moral language refers to the world outside the
     mind of the speaker, such that the language describes something objective. Here, its truth value is
     dependent on it existing separately in the world outside the speaker and be termed cognitive, in
     that it has the grounds by which it can be known. An example could be Utilitarianism. But the
     defender has to meet objections to the utilitarian claim that the experience of happiness is what
     moral language points to (see Mill’s defence of Utilitarianism and GE Moore’s naturalistic fallacy
     reply). Another defence might be the empirical observations of Virtue Ethics, with the concept of
     eudaimonia constituting the product of a moral life. Another defence could come from deontological
     approaches like Kant’s, or the divine command traditions of religion. Attempts to reduce moral
     language to some other constituent of human experience include the work of the Logical Positivists
     who argue for a different understanding of moral statements in emotivism. Prescriptivism is closely
     related to emotivism, and later in the 20th century thinkers used scientific theories (see Dawkins
     and The Selfish Gene) and economic theories (like Game Theory) to account for moral language in
     a non-cognitive way. JL Mackie believed any attempt to find a separate descriptive area of human
     experience covered by moral language to be an error.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Objectivism and subjectivism in moral language
     • Cognitivism and non-cognitivism
     • Is moral language “special” or “peculiar” in how it pictures itself and its place in the world?
     • The naturalistic fallacy
     • Examples of normative ethical principles with a cognitive basis, eg: teleological theories,
        deontological theories, divine command traditions
     • Primary and secondary properties
     • Non-cognitivist approaches, eg: Ayer and emotivism, prescriptivism
     • Scientific theories of ethics, eg: Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene
     • Language approaches to questions of the basis of ethics, eg: Hume, Wittgenstein
     • Economic and psychological theories of ethics, eg: Game Theory, The Prisoner’s Dilemma
     • The relation between moral language and natural properties, eg: GE Moore’s naturalistic fallacy.

Optional theme 4: Philosophy and contemporary society

9.   Evaluate the claim that the power of national culture can be seen as a response to
     globalization.                                                                                  [25]

     The claim is present in A. Touraine’s main work, Can We Live Together? Equality and Difference.
     It invites an exploration of a typical mark of contemporary society: the dualism between
     nationalisms and globalization. In Touraine’s view, nationalisms rise because people live a
     contrasting push between local interests and world markets: this relation is the root of possible
     conflicts, since globalization tends to be a mere market event, whereas the single specific local and
     national communities do not deeply recognize each other, except for economic exchanges and
     trades. Globalization brings a lot upheaval, economic change, opportunities for some, but
     significant (economic, social and political) losses for others. Communities can be left behind and
     become disenfranchised. It is often these communities that can turn to nationalism. Candidates
     might consider the concept of tolerance and how it calls for a real recognition of others and their
     diversity, eg: Locke, Mill. Responses might also discuss relations among nations and the possible
     domination of the stronger one over the weaker one, eg: Kant’s idea of perpetual peace.
     Candidates might explore the meaning and possibilities of multi-culturalism within the contrasting
     powers of nationalisms and globalization and the risk that minorities are progressively
     marginalized. Candidates might pinpoint the role of language and tradition to shape national
     identity, as opposed to global language, food, culture, and the importance that local factors have in
     shaping people’s identity, eg: Nietzsche. Responses might take into account views on populism,
     which often support cultural nationalism, and its specificities, eg: Dewey. Also, candidates might
     consider the meaning and role of democracy as a means to limit contrasting powers and to allow a
     dialogic framework, eg: Dewey, Nussbaum. Candidates might highlight the issue of conformity, as
     a consequence of globalization or as an effect of democratization of societies, as in the “tyranny
     of majority”, eg: de Tocqueville, Mill, or as in the “revolt of the masses”, eg: Ortega y Gasset.
     Finally, candidates might consider the utility of a democratic society, as in a contractarian view
     or neo-contractarian frame.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Nationalism as a possible response to globalization: possible limits of globalized cultures
     • The role of language in shaping identity
     • Globalization as a mere market phenomenon
     • Nationalism and diversity: minorities, migration, xenophobia, and other kinds of discrimination
     • The importance of tolerance, eg: Locke, Mill
     • Open society versus closed society, eg: Popper
     • Power relations and dominations, eg: Kant
     • Nationalism and local traditions in shaping identity, eg: Nietzsche
     • The possibilities of multi-culturalism within a globalized world or nationalisms, eg: Touraine
     • The role of populism in the rise of nationalisms, eg: Dewey
     • The importance of democracy in fostering dialogue and diversity, eg: Dewey, Nussbaum
     • The risks of globalization and democratization, as for the “tyranny of majority”,
        eg: de Tocqueville, Mill, Ortega y Gasset
     • Contractarian and neo-contractarian views on the utility of social agreement, including
        minorities, eg: Nozick.

10.   Evaluate the claim that fake news is a philosophical problem, and not a technical
      problem.                                                                                        [25]

      The claim is by technologist Matt Pearson and invites an exploration of several possible issues,
      which stem from the topic of “fake news”. Fake news is a central issue in contemporary society,
      which is widely based on information. Information and communication technologies (ICT) is a
      crucial field for contemporary societies, since they set the possibilities of spreading information,
      news, warnings, advertising. Candidates are invited to evaluate whether fake news is a mere
      technical issue, or whether it also involves people’s beliefs. Cognitive sciences have shown that
      people tend to select information on the basis of what they already know and are familiar with, in
      order to corroborate their standpoints and reduce cognitive dissonance (Festinger’s theory) as
      much as possible. Candidates might consider the philosophical concept of truth, which is
      connected to the issue of fake news: responses might focus on the possible universalistic
      interpretations of truth and might make reference to Plato and his theory of the divided line. The
      concept of opinion might be discussed from a contrasting perspective, eg: Mill’s view. Also,
      candidates might pinpoint the concept of knowledge and its nature and possibly refer to cognitive
      sciences and cognitive biases in exploring the meaning of belief, as opposed to truth. Subjectivity
      versus objectivity, realism versus nominalism might be other possible references. Relativity of truth
      might invite responses to focus on an analysis of the conventional nature of truth, eg: as social
      agreement. Moreover, candidates might consider the distinction between truth as agreement,
      eg: Aristotle’s adaequatio, and truth as discovery, eg: Heidegger’s view on aletheia. Candidates
      might investigate the political consequences of the control of information and news making: it is not
      all about censorship and propaganda, but it often operates more subtly. As de Tocqueville well
      explained, news making strictly depends on the specific culture and rules of a country: the way the
      public opinion is driven is also a mirror of that society. Candidates might consider Chomsky’s views
      on the relation between media and politics, the lack of identifiable sources, and the concept of “big
      brother”, which somehow recalls Orwell’s 1984. Conformity and homologation are the results of the
      “tyranny of majority”, as de Tocqueville, Mill, and Ortega y Gasset highlighted; but they are also the
      consequence of the consumer society and cultural industry, as the philosophers of the Frankfurt
      School explained, and others more recently, eg: Bauman. Therefore, candidates might evaluate
      whether fake news is not a technical problem, or how technology helps the creation and spread of
      fake news, eg: news on social media and how information has turned into “infotainment”, echoing
      what Debord foresaw in his Society of the Spectacle.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Truth as opposed to opinion and belief, eg: Plato
      • The role that beliefs and biases play in shaping knowledge and in selecting information
      • Truth as adaequatio or as aletheia, eg: Aristotle, Heidegger
      • The role of opinion in society, eg: de Tocqueville, Mill
      • The relation between media and politics, eg: Chomsky
      • Public opinion and conformity, as in the “tyranny of majority”, eg: de Tocqueville, Mill, Ortega y
         Gasset
      • Information and technology communication (ICT) and control of news making, eg: censorship,
         propaganda, monopoly
      • The profitability of spreading fake news, and the roles and responsibilities of big companies
         such as Facebook and Twitter
      • Information as a product of cultural industry, eg: the Frankfurt School, Bauman
      • Information and new digital devices, such as smartphones and social media
      • News as spectacle: “infotainment”, sensationalism, lack of decency, and deontology.

Optional theme 5: Philosophy of religion

11.   Evaluate the view that religious experience provides a motivation for belief.                     [25]

      This question looks at the issues of religious experience and behaviour as explanatory reasons (or
      motivation) for individuals to have religious belief. Responses might draw on a variety of accounts
      and traditions of religious experiences, including mysticism, near-death experiences, conversion,
      Sufism, Kabbalism or reaction to prayer. The characteristics of religious experience, for example
      the noetic, ineffable, transcendent, charismatic or revelatory experience of the individual might be
      raised. But the question is not asking for a description of such experiences, but the role they play in
      motivating individual belief. In covering this, responses might investigate the verifiability or
      falsification of claims about religious experience, and how an individual might be motivated to
      belief, but not necessarily to justify it rationally, given the basis of the experience not being
      primarily intellectual. See Schleiermacher and Kierkegaard in their work on the relation of the
      subject to the experience of faith. Responses might look at other explanations for accounts of
      religious experience, including sympathetic ones from works like William James’s The Varieties
      of Religious Experience to more skeptical accounts of religious behaviour as seen in cults or
      fundamentalist groupings, often leading to radicalization. Here, the possibilities of indoctrination,
      illusion, projection or psychological pressure (eg: ‘love bombing’) might be raised. Modern
      psychology or neuroscience might be raised in attempts to explain religious experience, but
      responses might reject a reductionist approach as being irrelevant to the thing being addressed,
      given that personal experiences are not able to be accounted for by empirical measurement or
      investigation. Alternative motivations might be used as counter-examples, eg: Marx offering social
      and political motivations for religious behaviour and belief. Freud offered an early psychological
      account, as did his pupil and colleague, Jung. Responses may well treat the question in terms of
      an issue about religious language and how accounts of religious experience are framed from a
      language-problem perspective.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • The characteristics of religious experience
      • Can religious experience denote motivation for specific belief, or is it about spiritual awareness
         of a more general kind?
      • The issue of answered prayer and the problem of suffering
      • Philosophical approaches to motivation for belief – is language with a motivational element to
         be treated differently from usual propositional language?
      • Wittgenstein’s language games
      • Verification and falsification
      • Challenges to religious experience – illusion, projection, indoctrination
      • Challenges to religious experience as motivation to belief, eg: Freud, Jung, Marx, Durkheim,
         Weber
      • Modern accounts, eg: Foucault, psychology, neuroscience.

12.   Evaluate the coherence of the characteristics and attributes of God(s).                          [25]

      This question invites exploration of the characteristics and attributes of God(s), most traditionally
      claims about God’s omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, immutability and timelessness.
      God(s) as creator, both of the physical universe and the moral law, might be addressed.
      Responses may engage with other attributes like indivisibility, immanence, transcendence, or with
      pantheistic accounts. But the most common attribute is omnipotence, which raises questions about
      logical consistency (see the paradox of the stone) and moral consistency (see the problem of evil).
      Omniscience raises the issue of the immutability of God(s), given knowing all suggests God’s
      knowledge must change over time as human knowledge does, or humans would have no freedom.
      The issue of God’s omnibenevolence is challenged through various arguments to do with the
      problem of evil and suffering, and God’s authorship of the moral law is challenged through the
      Euthyphro dilemma of Plato. In God’s relation to time, God’s immutability is also questioned, given
      the nature of time being change, so responses may look at God’s eternal nature either as a form of
      timelessness or everlastingness. Alternative approaches like pantheism or panentheism (that God
      is in everything) might be covered, as might postmodern accounts, like those stemming from
      secular humanism (see Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Cupitt). A question that might be asked is the
      possible coherence of the whole system, as opposed to individual characteristics, loosening the
      reliance of faith on strict rational criteria or logical formalism. There is also the possibility of
      discussing this issue in relation to motivations for belief in the existence of God.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • God(s) as omnipotent (see the paradox of the stone)
      • God(s) as omnipresent (see the issue of timelessness, everlastingness, immutability)
      • God(s) as sustainer of the universe over time and the issues of immanence and transcendence,
         eg: Aquinas
      • God(s) in relation to morality, eg: the Euthyphro dilemma, the problem of evil and suffering
      • God(s) as all-knowing/omniscient and the issue of human freedom
      • Modern accounts of God(s) starting with Nietzsche, Kierkegaard and post-modernism
      • Secular humanist accounts, eg: Schweitzer, the Tubingen School, Cupitt

Optional theme 6: Philosophy of science

13.   Evaluate the claim that experimentation is the central feature of science.                          [25]

      The aim of this question is to invite an evaluation of the role experimentation plays in science.
      An experiment is an intentional manipulation of the environment in order to test a theory or just to
      explore the phenomena. In a classical conception of physics, the experiment has been defined as
      the very principle of science, its definition. In this view, the experiment is the test of all knowledge.
      However, the variety and complexity of present scientific knowledge requires further analysis as to
      the extent to which experimentation might be identified as the central feature of science. During the
      rise of the natural sciences in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the nature and role of
      experiment has been a central focus of the reflection on science. In present days looking at the
      role of experiments within the overall practice of science it stands out that in order to perform
      experiments, researchers have to intervene actively in the material world. When doing so,
      scientists produce all kinds of new objects, substances, phenomena and processes. So,
      experimentation involves the material realization of the experimental system (the object of study,
      the apparatus, and their interaction) as well as an active intervention in the environment of this
      system. Since the question presents experimentation as the central feature of science answers
      might alternatively discuss other features of science held as central.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • The extent to which an experiment is the only judge of scientific truth
      • The relation between experimentation and formulation of hypothesis
      • A central feature of experimentation is the manipulation of, and the interference with, material
         things; implications and effects
      • An experiment aims to realize a reproducible correlation between an observable feature of the
         apparatus and a feature of the object under investigation
      • Experiments make use of a good deal of theory in their construction
      • Scientific objectivity, experimentation and the reality of scientific entities
      • Dewey’s position, who kept experience in terms of experimentation central
      • Popper’s discussion of whether experiments can verify theories; he thinks that the best they can
         do is to falsify them
      • Kuhn’s view that experiments alone do not change scientific consensus, but a paradigm shift is
         needed
      • Experimentation in different sciences from physics to biology
      • The relationship between experiment and technology
      • The control required of the experimental system and its environment
      • Laboratory experiments in physics, chemistry, and biochemistry often allow control of the
         objects under investigation; in contrast, in field biology, medicine, psychology, and social
         science a strict experimental control is often not feasible
      • The extent to which it still makes sense to speak of a ‘‘natural’’ nature when one merely deals
         with artificially produced laboratory worlds?
      • The results of experimental science acquire certain endurance and autonomy: the knowledge
         encapsulated in material things, such as Watson and Crick’s material double-helix model
      • Social issues reflected in experimentation eg: the exclusion of Rosalind Franklin’s contributions
         to the development of the double-helix model
      • Thought experiments in various domains. Examples in physics including: Galileo’s falling
         bodies, Maxwell’s demon, Einstein’s elevator and train, Schrodinger’s cat, and Heisenberg’s
         microscope
      • The increasing use of ‘‘computer experiments’’
      • Modelling and experimentation
      • The role of experimentation in the shaping of the scientific method, eg: Claude Bernard’s and
         the study of experimental medicine
      • Overlapping aspects under discussion: the technical details aspects of experiments, the
         epistemological justification of experimental knowledge, and the social legitimacy of the
         experimental style of doing science.

14.   Evaluate the view that scientific research should be guided by ethical and social
      responsibility.                                                                                   [25]

      This question invites an evaluation of the extent to which research should be guided by ethical and
      social responsibility. The current developments in science and technology which have led to the
      concern that uncontrolled scientific progress is not always ethically or socially acceptable. During
      the last decades there have been growing worries regarding the development of scientific
      research. These concerns relate, among others, to: ethical issues raised by science, such as
      genetic engineering or global warming; cases of ethical misconduct in many aspects of research,
      including allegations of plagiarism, and violations of recombinant DNA regulations; ethical conflicts
      between scientific values and business or military values. In response to this, different perspectives
      have stressed the need to establish common values and benchmarks, as well as to promote
      ethical principles and standards to guide scientific progress and technological development.
      Reflection on the role that ethical and social responsibility should have in the progress of science
      and technology expresses present global concerns. These concerns appear in different forms and
      are carried out by individuals and institutions. For instance, UNESCO’s activities in ethics of
      science and technology examine such progress in light of ethical considerations rooted in the
      cultural, legal, philosophical and religious heritage of various human communities.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Ethical issues arise as a result of science’s interaction with the public because scientific
         research often has important social, moral, and political consequences
      • The relationship between science and society; the moral responsibilities of scientists
      • Social and ethical issues related to present scientific research, eg: ownership of genetic
         information, use and control of natural resources
      • The extent to which in order to progress, scientific knowledge must be free of restrictions
      • The view that no significant ethical issues arise in science because science is “objective.” It
         studies facts, employs objective methods, and produces knowledge and consensus. Ethics
         involves the study of values, employs subjective methods, and produces opinion and
         disagreement
      • Science might be seen as a career. Thus, some scientists may be tempted to violate ethical
         principles in order to advance their careers
      • Data indicate that the frequency of misconduct in science is low when compared to the
         frequency of misconduct in other professions, such as business, medicine, or law
      • Research in many sciences carries economic rewards; funding for research and the need to
         produce results
      • Science is a cooperative activity that takes place within a larger social and political context;
         scientists cannot escape from the ethical problems and issues that arise in other aspects of
         social life
      • The realization of science’s practical goals which include solving problems in engineering,
         medicine, economics, agriculture, and other areas of applied research might be in accordance
         with ethical and social values or not
      • The role of institutions: In 1998 UNESCO established the World Commission on the Ethics of
         Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) to advise on issues concerning ethics of
         scientific knowledge and technology
      • The UNESCO recommendation that ethics and the responsibility of science should be an
         integral part of the education and training of all scientists and that they should be encouraged to
         respect and adhere to basic ethical principles and responsibilities of science
      • The centrality of peer review and language agreement implying the importance of co-operation
         and consensus, with open testing/criticism
      • The concept of democracy in relation to the role of ethical and social responsibility, eg: Dewey
      • The impact of political pressure; the development of nuclear weapons and Niels Bohr’s views
      • Responsibility and scientific research in the diverse fields of investigation and practices,
         eg: Beauchamp - Childress and the principles of biomedical ethics.

Optional theme 7: Political philosophy

15.   Evaluate the claim that the state has authority over its citizens in a civil society.              [25]

      This question asks about the nature of state authority in a society that is described as civil. This
      assumes – and this can be discussed in the responses – that there are certain conditions that must
      be met for the word “civil” to describe a society, resting on the agreement of the citizen with the
      rule or authority in operation. Notions of the state and its distinction from the concept of nation
      could be addressed, as can the theoretical or historical origins of state authority over the individual.
      The social contract was an early philosophical approach to understanding the relationship between
      individual citizens and the authority of the state, and there were different versions of this from the
      dystopian vision of Hobbes’s Leviathan to Rousseau’s more romantic notion of the noble savage in
      his Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Among Men (although Rousseau never uses the term
      identified previously by a different author). Locke provided a version that discussed the concept of
      property and the individual’s rights to rebel if that property was threatened by state action. Forms of
      government might be discussed, as routes to the legitimacy of state authority, including why
      democracy is argued for as the most enlightened form of government. Other forms of government
      include theocracy, monarchy or tribalism, where the agreement of the citizen is not expressed
      through participation in an election process. Is “enlightened dictatorship” a possibility? Ideologies
      may be mentioned, including the current battle between populism and liberalism in western
      countries. Answers might investigate communist systems of rule and global interactions between
      different systems through trade or the operations of the United Nations.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Distinctions between state and nation
      • The notion of civil society
      • Social contract theory, eg: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau
      • Criticism of social contract theory being based on speculation, eg: Hume
      • Modern versions of the social contract, eg: Rawls, Sen
      • Modern neo-liberalism, eg: Hayek, Friedman, Nozick
      • How might totalitarian rule count against “civil society”?
      • Anarchism and the grounds for revolution
      • Forms of government including non-western models involving tribal authority or monarchy
      • Political ideologies – what distinguishes a “command economy” like those in N Korea or China?

16.   Evaluate the claim that promoting the rights of specific groups involves an
      unacceptable assault on fairness.                                                                [25]

      This question involves thinking about contemporary global debates ranging from the recent Black
      Lives Matter protests to the #Metoo movement, along with activism about the politics about gender
      fluidity, indigenous peoples’ rights and the issues of immigration and asylum seekers. In
      addressing rights of specific groups of people, the issue of social justice is addressed. Responses
      might explore how rights arise and what rights should entail, as well as grant, for an individual. The
      foundation of minority rights is found in Mill’s On Liberty, yet the most fundamental appeal in that
      work remains utilitarianism and the issue of the will of the strong remains a question. If a majority
      opposes specific protections or promotions of minority groups, on what grounds could those rights
      of minority groups be asserted? In promoting the rights of specific groups, the issues of distributive
      and retributive justice arise. In asserting equality as a social good, how far can any individual or
      institution be required to offer advantage, or even representation, to protected groups? Nussbaum
      treats this question in terms of the ability for women to prosper in their work Creating Capabilities.
      Other writers, like Hayek or Nozick, would not support any interference of the state in social
      matters. Responses might use employment practice or university selection, as examples, where
      the phrase ‘positive discrimination’ is used for recruitment. Gender and sexual politics and race or
      religious discrimination might be explored. The relationship between freedom, fairness and equality
      might be explored, asking if any form of promotion of one group, in the interests of inclusivity or
      diversity, is fair to another group. Responses might refer to Rawls’s A Theory of Justice. What is
      “fair” in this discussion? And what – and who judges what – is justice in questions such as these?

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      • Distributive and retributive justice – what is social justice and what does it look like?
      • The rights of individuals and minority or specific groups
      • How do rights arise?
      • Equality versus freedom and fairness
      • Positive discrimination
      • The philosophical assumptions involved in promoting specific groups, eg: in employment or
         university recruitment
      • The majority vs the minority, eg: Mill
      • The individual and the group – how far can I judge an individual by characteristics other than
         universal human ones?
      • The rejection of social justice, eg: Hayek, Nozick, contemporary neo-liberalism
      • Contemporary issues, eg: race, gender, disability, sexuality, age, political representation,
         indigenous peoples
      • The rise of populism as a counter to communitarian liberal ideology.
