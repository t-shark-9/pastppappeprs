Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

1.     (a)   Explain two types of government intervention that could be used to correct the
             market failure arising from the consumption of demerit goods.                            [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: market failure, demerit goods.
             • Explanation: of any two types of government intervention such as indirect
               taxes, legislation and regulation, education/awareness creation/negative
               advertising.
             • Diagram could show market failure of demerit goods and/or demand and
               supply diagram showing the consequence of the policy explained.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one form of government intervention
             is explained.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss whether public goods should always be
      provided directly by the government.                                                    [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: public good.
      • Explanation: of why the government should directly provide public goods in
        terms of the advantages involved, such as overcoming the problem of the
        market not allocating resources to the production of public goods due to the
        features of non-excludability and non-rivalry, and the free rider problem; the
        positive externalities associated with public goods; the possible impact of extra
        government spending on AD and or LRAS.
      • Diagram: no diagram is required for this question, although some candidates
        may choose to use a diagram related to the question.
      • Synthesis (discuss): in terms of the possible reasons why the government
        should not directly provide public goods, such as the additional government
        spending involved and the problem of opportunity cost; the problem of
        deciding which public goods should be provided and in what quantities; the
        difficulty of estimating future benefits in any cost benefit analysis; the possible
        benefits to be achieved by contracting out to the private sector.
      • Examples: use of real-world examples of public goods being directly provided
        by the government with associated advantages or disadvantages.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the view that inequality can best be reduced

      Answers may include:

        can work to make the post-tax distribution of income more equal; the difficulty
        of reducing income inequalities through any means other than progressive
        taxation; the selective use of indirect taxes involving higher taxes on luxury
        goods consumed by the better off and lower taxes/no taxes on essential items
        needed by the poor.
      • Diagram: use of an appropriate diagram, such as the Lorenz curve to show
        the impact on inequality.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): a challenge to the view in terms of the possible
        disincentive effects of progressive taxation and the problems of using indirect
        taxes; a consideration of alternative measures such as use of transfer
        payments, a universal basic income, minimum wages, policies to reduce
        discrimination, other policies to reduce inequalities of opportunity, such as
        health and education.
      • Examples: real-world examples of changes in taxation and/or other policies
        reducing inequality.

      A maximum of [12] should be awarded if only changes in taxation are considered.

             • Explanation: of any two reasons that government indebtedness could act as
               barrier to economic growth, such as the opportunity cost to governments of

               economic growth/lack of economic growth or a PPC diagram to illustrate

        designed to further the political ends of donor countries.
