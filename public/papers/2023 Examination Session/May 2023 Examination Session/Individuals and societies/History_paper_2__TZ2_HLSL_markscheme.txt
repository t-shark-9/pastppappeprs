Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1. Evaluate the importance of factors affecting the transmission of ideas and cultures in two societies.

   Candidates will make an appraisal of the factors affecting the transmission of ideas and cultures in
   two societies, weighing up their importance. The two societies may or may not be from the same
   region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the ideas and cultures, or they may prioritise their
   evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
   evaluate the importance of traders carrying goods and knowledge along the Silk Road; maritime
   trade facilitating the transmission of religion and ideas from Arab communities to Asia; pilgrimages by
   both Christians and Moslem that facilitated the inter-mixing of populations and ideas. The importance
   of the Crusades may also be evaluated as transmitters of culture and knowledge, especially from the
   Middle East to Europe. Other relevant factors may be evaluated such as the negative impact of the
   Black Death and the decline of the Mayan Empire, when a reduction in trade slowed down the
   transmission of ideas and culture. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.


2. Evaluate the significance of religious leaders in the government of two societies.

   Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of religious leaders in the government of two
   societies, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two societies may or may not be from the
   same region. Candidates may evaluate the significance of Pope Gregory VII’s conflict with King
   Henry IV of Germany over the supremacy of the Church over temporal rulers or the significance of
   Thomas Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury to the court and rule of Henry II. The significance of
   priests in Mayan society may be evaluated in relation to their crucial role as intermediaries with the
   gods as their knowledge of astronomy and the Mayan calendars ensured their valued role in the
   government of the empire. There may also be an evaluation of the significance of Mansa Musa or the
   Abbasid Caliphs who combined the roles of a religious and temporal leader. Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –5–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3. “Territorial disputes were the most important cause of war in the period 750–1500.” With reference
   to two wars, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
   territorial disputes were the most important cause of war in the period 750-1500. The two wars may
   or may not be from the same region. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly
   linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they
   may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response.
   Candidates may appraise disputes created by the territorial expansion of emerging states, for
   example the Seljuk Empire during the Byzantine-Seljuk wars. There may be an appraisal of disputes
   over areas of religious significance, such as the Crusades. Similarly, candidates may appraise
   conflicts over territories of economic/strategic importance, for example the Hundred Years War.
   Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example dynastic disputes, or tension over religious or
   ethnic differences, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
   will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

4. Evaluate the significance of human and economic resources to the outcome of two wars, each
   chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of human and economic resources to the
   outcome of two wars, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two wars must be from
   different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of human and economic resources, or they
   may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
   response. Candidates may appraise the efficiency in the provision of soldiers and its impact on the
   outcome of the war. They may evaluate the means used to obtain soldiers through the feudal
   system, standing armies, or alliances. Candidates may also evaluate the mobilization of supplies,
   such as food and weapons, along protected routes. There may be an appraisal of the mobilization of
   economic resources to support the war effort using, for example, loans or taxes. Other relevant
   factors may be addressed, for example the role of leaders and the organization of warfare, but with a
   focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –6–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5. Examine the nature of the power of two rulers, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates examine the nature of the power of two rulers The two rulers
   must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the rulers, or they may
   prioritize their examination of one of them. However, both rulers will be a feature of the response.
   Candidates may refer to William I of England who supplemented his military power with feudal
   contracts, administrative reform and the import of Norman allies. They may examine the brutality of
   Hongwu, to which was added a strengthened bureaucracy and secret police. There may be an
   examination of the rule of Tamerlane and Basil II, who also combined military power with effective
   administration and fiscal reform. However, Harun al-Rashid's reliance on devolution of power,
   supported by ultra-loyal ministers proved insufficient to prevent numerous rebellions. Candidates’
   opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

6. To what extent were two rulers successful in dealing with challenges to their power?

   The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which rulers were successful in dealing with
   challenges to their power. The two rulers may or may not be from the same region. Results of their
   policies may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
   question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two rulers, or they may prioritize their
   assessment of one of them. However, both rulers will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
   consider Tran Thanh Tong’s success in resisting the Yuans, which nevertheless left his son to
   defeat invasion. They may consider the successes of Baibars in defeating Sinjar and challenges
   from the Mongols and Crusaders. The second Bulgarian Empire’s record against multiple external
   challenges was mixed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
   by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7. Examine the impact of population expansion and movements on the economy of two societies, each
   chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between the impact of
   population movement and expansion on the economy of two societies. The two societies must be
   from different regions. Candidates may examine the Encomienda system in the Americas that often
   involved the displacement of indigenous people who became a source of free labour. In Europe, the
   crisis of the seventeenth century may be examined with reference to the decline in population that
   both contributed to, and exacerbated, economic problems. In Ming China, an examination of how
   population movement from areas affected by drought and bad harvests impacted the economy would
   be relevant, as would examination of how the capture and sale of slaves from Africa impacted the
   economy of both Africa and the American colonies. Other relevant interrelationships may be
   considered, for example the growth of mercantile companies to facilitate trade and growth of
   empires, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8. “The use of printed text was the most important influence on religious expansion and conversion.”
   Discuss with reference to two societies.
   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the use of printed text was the most important influence on religious expansion and conversion in two
   societies. The two societies may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal
   coverage of religious expansion and conversion or prioritise the discussion of one of them. However,
   both aspects will feature in the response. Candidates may discuss the importance of the availability
   of religious tracts and copies of the Bible, often in the vernacular. In particular, the use of printed
   texts may be seen as an important method of conversion to Lutheranism with its emphasis on faith
   without the intercession of a priest. Other influences may be discussed, such as armed conflict, for
   example the Thirty Years War, that often compelled the conversion of populations to Catholicism or
   Protestantism. There may be discussion of the role of missionaries, who often accompanied the
   conquistadores, and the use of violence and torture to convert indigenous people to Christianity.
   Other relevant factors may be discussed, such as economic incentives to encourage conversion
   where business and trade, for example, could be facilitated by adopting a different religion, but with a
   focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –8–                   M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9. Compare and contrast the reasons for colonial/imperial expansion of two Early Modern states, each
   chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
   two early modern states in terms of the reasons for colonial/imperial expansion, referring to both
   throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. The two early modern states must
   be from different regions. Reasons may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
   issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to religious reasons such as the desire to defend
   fellow religious practitioners or evangelise foreign populations, for example the Portuguese
   expansion into Africa. Candidates may also give an account of similarities and differences with
   reference to political reasons such as the capitalization of internal conflicts abroad, or exploits fuelled
   by personal ambitions. Candidates may also refer to the role of resources in colonial/imperial
   expansion. Mention may be made of empires that expanded in search of precious metals (Spanish
   Empire), control over agricultural land and water (Ajuran Sultanate), or commodities such as spices
   (Dutch Empire). Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

10. To what extent were rebellions a serious challenge to the colonial rule of two Early Modern states?

   The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which rebellions were a serious
   challenge to the colonial rule of two early modern states. The two states may or may not be from the
   same region. The challenges posed by the rebellions may extend beyond the timeframe, but they
   must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
   both states, or they may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a
   feature of the response. Candidates may appraise the extent of challenges posed by rebellions and
   their economic or political impact. For example, candidates may appraise the challenges posed by
   failed rebellions, such as the Bengal and Bihar rebellions in 1580; or successful ones, such as the
   British Colonies in North America in 1776. There may also be an appraisal of the enduring social
   impact of movements such as the Pueblo Revolt, or their inspiration to later independence
   movements such as Tupac Amaru's rebellion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
   clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –9–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11. “The most important causes of wars were political.” Discuss, with reference to two wars, each
    chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the most important causes of early modern wars were political. The two wars must be from different
   regions. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
   question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two wars, or they may prioritize their
   discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
   discuss the Dutch War of Independence where a desire for independence was an important political
   cause, as was the struggle for parliamentary rights in the case of the English Civil War. The Mughal
   conquest of northern India was made possible by the decline of the Delhi sultanate and judicious
   political alliances. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example economic and religious
   causes, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

12. Evaluate the significance of the organization of warfare to the outcome of two wars.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of the organization of
   warfare to the outcome of two wars, weighing up its importance or otherwise. The two wars may or
   may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two wars, or they may
   prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response.
   Candidates may evaluate the significance of the Swedish recruitment system during the Great
   Northern War, Akbar’s mansabdari system in Mughal advances in India, the patient five-year build-up
   of forces by the Pueblo rebels or the highly-organized Japanese invasion of Korea (1592). Aspects of
   organization could include training and logistics. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
   example technological advances, leadership, tactics and strategy, but with a focus on the issue in the
   question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –                M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13. Discuss the view that developments in communication were the most important factor in the
    industrialization of two countries.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
   developments in communication were the most important factor in the industrialisation of two
   countries. The two countries may or may be chosen from the same region. Candidates may offer
   equal coverage of both countries or they may prioritise the discussion of one of them. However, both
   will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the development of the telegraph in
   relation to the transmission of money orders that made banking and the flow of capital more efficient.
   The laying of telegraph cables between Europe and the United States and its importance for trade
   and industrialisation may be discussed. Candidates may discuss developments in communication to
   be synonymous with those in transportation and so may refer to improvements in road surfaces, the
   digging of canals and laying of railway lines as important factors contributing to industrialisation.
   Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example, access to raw materials such as coal and iron
   ore and the availability of capital, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
   or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

14. Evaluate the impact of industrialization on the labour conditions in two countries.

   Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of industrialisation on the labour conditions in two
   countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal
   coverage of both countries, or they may prioritise the evaluation of one of them. However, both will
   be a feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate how, initially, the impact of industrialisation
   created dangerous labour conditions whilst more recent technological advances have made
   conditions safer with machinery doing much of the dangerous work in factories and coal mines. In
   countries where industrialisation took place more recently, there may be an evaluation of how the
   invention of more efficient and safer methods of production made labour conditions safer although in
   economically poorer countries these may have remained dangerous to health and safety. Other
   relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the willingness of governments to legislate for better
   working conditions or the presence of powerful worker unions, but with a focus on the issue in the
   question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
   evidence.
                                                  – 11 –                M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15. Evaluate the importance of nationalism to the development of two independence movements.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of nationalism to the development of two
   independence movements, weighing up its importance or otherwise. The two independence
   movements may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
   independence movements, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both
   movements will be a feature of the response. Candidates may appraise the role of nationalism in the
   development of a new, distinct identity. They may also evaluate the role of nationalism as a binding
   element in colonies that contained different ethnic/linguistic or religious groups. The role of political
   parties such as the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons in Nigeria can provide an
   example. There may also be an appraisal of the role of nationalism as the ideological support for
   independence movements, and as an inspirational force behind recruitment. Other relevant factors
   may be addressed, for example religion, race, social and economic factors, but with a focus on the
   issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
   by appropriate evidence.

16. “Social issues were the most important challenge faced in the first ten years of
    independence.” Discuss, with reference to two states, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   social issues were the most important challenge faced in the first ten years of independence. The
   two states must be from different regions. Consequence/results of the challenges may extend
   beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
   Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of
   them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the
   importance of challenges in unifying multi-ethnic/lingual or multi-religious groups or of ethnic tensions
   exacerbated after independence. . Candidates may also discuss long-standing social injustices and
   actions taken by elites to maintain their positions, or restrictions imposed by newly dominant groups..
   Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example cultural and economic challenges, but with a
   focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17. “The development of political parties was the most important factor in the emergence of democracy.”
    Discuss, with reference to two democratic states, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the development of political parties was the most important factor in the emergence of democracy.
   The two states must be from different regions. Factors may predate the timeframe, but they must be
   clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two
   states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature
   of the response. Candidates may discuss the importance of the established parties in Weimar
   Germany (not all of whom were loyal to democracy) and Congress in India. In Israel, while the
   Mapai pre-dated independence, important roles were played by the short-lived United Religious
   Front, and, later, the newly founded Likud. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
   economic stability, social cohesion or otherwise, or limitations placed on the military , but with a focus
   on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.

18. Evaluate the impact of cultural policies in two democratic states.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of cultural
   policies in two democratic states, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two states may or
   may not be from the same region. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly
   linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states, or
   they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the
   response. Candidates may evaluate states’ policies in promoting the arts through subsidy or
   education. They may evaluate the impact on both popular culture and fine art. They may evaluate the
   impact of policies on freedom of expression, possibly in relation to broadcasting and the print media.
   The range of culture referred to could also include architecture, music, theatre, dance and sport.
   Evaluation could focus on the amount of culture, its quality, and creativity. Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19. “Economic conditions were the most important factor in the emergence of authoritarian
    states.” Discuss with reference to two states, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   economic conditions were the most important factor in the emergence of two authoritarian states.
   The two states must be chosen from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
   states or they may prioritise the discussion of one of them. However, both will be a feature of the
   response. Candidates may discuss Germany where high unemployment was crucial to the surge of
   popular support in the elections of 1930 and 1932. Similarly, high inflation and unemployment
   contributed to the emergence of the People’s Republic of China. In Cuba, high (and seasonal)
   unemployment may be discussed as a significant factor in garnering support for the Fidelistas whilst
   in Italy, strikes during the “biennio rosso” contributed to the popularity of the Fascist Movement
   among the middle-class. Other relevant factors may be discussed, such as the use of propaganda,
   the weakness of existing governments and/or victory in regional or civil wars, but with a focus on the
   issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

20. Evaluate the importance of charismatic leadership to the maintenance of power in two authoritarian
    states.

   Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of charismatic leadership to the maintenance of
   power in two authoritarian states. The two states may or may not be chosen from the same region.
   Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states or they may prioritise the evaluation of one of
   them. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate the importance of
   Mussolini’s charismatic leadership enhanced by newsreels, newspapers and speeches given from
   balconies to vast crowds. The importance of Mao’s god-like status elevated during the Cultural
   Revolution may be evaluated and in Argentina the importance of the personality cult of Peron and his
   wife, Evita, as evidenced by the outpouring of grief on her death in 1952. Other relevant factors may
   be addressed, for example, the state of the economy, foreign policy, suppression of opposition, but
   with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
   clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21. “Economic factors were the most significant cause of war.” Discuss with reference to two wars, each
    chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   economic factors were the most significant cause of war. The two wars must be from different
   regions. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
   the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they may prioritize their
   discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
   discuss the role of economic hardship as a precursor of wars, as seen in Argentina prior to the
   Falklands/Malvinas War. Candidates may also consider the role of economic disparities in the
   escalation of tensions leading to internal conflicts, for example the Chinese and Russian civil wars.
   Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example ideological, political, and territorial, but with a
   focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.

22. “Peacemaking largely failed.” With reference to two wars, to what extent do you agree with this
    statement?
   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
   peacemaking largely failed. The two wars may or may not be from the same region. Consequences
   of the peacemaking process may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
   issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they may
   prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response.
   Candidates may consider different aspects in their consideration of peacemaking. For instance,
   they may consider post WWI treaties failures, given their role in future conflicts. Conversely,
   candidates may consider treaties that acted as a counterweight to growing influences, such as the
   Treaty of Portsmouth (1905), as examples of relative success. They may also consider treaties that
   achieved lasting peace, such as the Treaty of San Francisco (1951). Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23. “Reconciliation was more important than confrontation in superpower relations.” Discuss with
    reference to the period between 1980 and 1991.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   reconciliation was more important than confrontation in superpower relations between 1980-1991.
   The focus may or may not be on the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
   reconciliation and confrontation, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
   both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss confrontation in the forms of
   the US boycott of the Moscow Olympics in response to the USSR’s invasion of Afghanistan, the
   Soviet Union’s disregard for the Helsinki Agreements, and the policies of the early Reagan years,
   characterised by hostile rhetoric and increased military spending. The SDI initiative may be
   discussed. Reconciliation came with Gorbachev’s foreign policy and Reagan’s willingness to
   discuss nuclear disarmament, resulting in successful negotiations of the INF treaty and, later on, of
   START. Reconciliation was also seen in superpower cooperation at the UN, to the benefit of peace
   agreements in Namibia and Cambodia, and Middle Eastern diplomacy; also, the USSR did not
   prevent the US led coalition from intervening in Kuwait in the in the First Gulf War.. Candidates’
   opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

24. “Mistrust between the superpowers was the most important cause of Cold War crises.” Discuss, with
   reference to two crises, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   mistrust between the superpowers was the most important cause of Cold War crises. The two crises
   must be from different regions. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked
   to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two crises, or they
   may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
   response. Candidates may discuss the mistrust of Soviet intentions in Berlin in 1948 and Cuba in
   1962 or the mistrust of the US’s aims in Korea, especially after military action spread to the North.
   Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the defence of spheres of influence, which
   triggered Soviet invasions of Hungary and Czechoslovakia, or the roles of leaders such as Nasser,
   but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
   clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
