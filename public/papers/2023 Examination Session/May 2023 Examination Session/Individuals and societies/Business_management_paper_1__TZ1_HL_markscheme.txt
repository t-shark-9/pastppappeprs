                                              Section A
1.   (a)   Outline two disadvantages for SVT’s employees of the new flexible-working contract (lines
           60–62).                                                                        [4]


           Disadvantages include:
           • The employees would have to accept change following many years of operating in an
              unchanged way.
           • The older employees, who are mostly rejecting the change, are very used to working
              from 8am to 5pm (line 53).
           • The shift pattern is happening alongside other modernization programmes. The
              employees may be objecting to the whole package.
           • SVT lost a significant number of experienced employees because of this change
              (25% left (line 63)). Newer staff lost the chance to work with experienced colleagues.
           • The employees would have to change the hours they worked every six months (line
              62). They may not like this pattern.
           Accept any other relevant disadvantage
           Mark as 2 + 2.
           Award [1] for each appropriate disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for a description
           of how it impacts on the employees of SVT.

           Award a maximum of [2] for each disadvantage.

           Award a maximum of [4] in total.

     (b)   Explain the factors that SVT should consider when deciding on a pricing strategy
           for the WF15 water purifier (lines 126–131).                                     [6]

           Factors include:
           • Likely market demand—Demand could be very high given the ease of using the product
             in different situations (a few hours of sunlight) (line 124).
           • Production and other costs—the WF15 had to meet strict criteria in terms of cost
             suggesting it is relatively inexpensive.
           • SVT’s objectives—should it be a not-for-profit product? (lines 127–128).
           • Directors—some feel that the product should be subsidized to make it affordable. Not
             all directors feel this though (lines 128–129).
           • Other stakeholders such as shareholders may wish to maximize profits.
           • Competitors prices—SVT may wish to examine the price charged by competitors to
             establish a benchmark price for themselves.


           Accept any other relevant factor and explanation.
           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer

           Award a maximum of [4] for limiting the explanation to only one factor.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

           Award a maximum of [6] for a developed answer in context
                                                  –8–                M23/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


2.   (a)   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage for SVT of Ariadne’s leadership
           style (lines 21–26).                                                                           [4]

            Ariadne displays an autocratic leadership style.
            Advantages:
           • This may have led to higher productivity per employee (lines 23–24).
           • Ariadne is the sole decision-maker meaning that decisions are made quickly to
               respond to quickly unexpected changes. This fits in with the directors having operational
               and tactical authority (line 15).
               Disadvantages:
           •   Ariadne often has different priorities, and this has led to conflict with Yannick (lines
               25–26).
           •   Ariadne can be inflexible.
           •   Ariadne can make poor decisions leading to weaker performance for SVT.
           Mark as 2 + 2.
           Award [1] for each appropriate advantage/disadvantage identified and an additional
           [1] for a description of how it impacts on SVT.

           Award a maximum of [2] per advantage/disadvantage.

           Award a maximum of [4] in total.

     (b)   Explain different distribution channels that SVT could use for the WF15 water
           purifier (lines 132–133).                                                                      [6]

           Distribution channels include:
           • SVT could make use of agents in different countries. They have no experience of
              operating in LEDCs and may benefit from using experts in distribution in those
              countries (lines 132–133).
           • The lack of use of traditional promotion approaches may have an impact on how the
              product is distributed. SVT may need very direct approaches to communicate effectively
              with the potential customer.
           • SVT could try a traditional approach to selling the WF15 by using wholesalers and
              retailers. Much will depend on exactly where the product will be sold.
           • SVT could sell them through charities and/or NGO, and/or those employees who are
              taking part in the Outreach Programme.
           • SVT could sell using aspects of e-commerce/online selling making use of social media.


           Accept any other relevant distribution channel and explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer

           Award a maximum of [4] for limiting the explanation to only one distribution
           channel.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

           Award a maximum of [6] for a developed answer in context.

3.   (a)   Outline two non-financial rewards that SVT could have used for the long-serving employees
           that wanted to leave the company because of the implementation of the flexible-working
           contract (lines 56–64).                                                                 [4]

           Non-financial rewards include:
           • Job enrichment
           • Job rotation
           • Job enlargement
           • Empowerment
           • Teamwork
           • Purpose/the opportunity to make a difference
           Accept any reasonable answer.
           In the case of SVT, they offered a one-time incentive payment to those who agreed to the
           new contract—a financial reward.
           The non-financial rewards listed above could have been considered as alternative
           approaches, e.g., greater consultation around additional responsibilities / changes to job
           roles / enhanced use of group or team working etc.

           Mark as 2 + 2.


           Award [1] for each appropriate non-financial reward identified and an additional [1]
           for a description of how it impacts on SVT.

           Award a maximum of [2] per reward.

           Award a maximum of [4] in total.

(b)   With reference to STEEPLE factors, explain changes in the external environment
      that may have affected SVT (lines 20–21).                                                [6]


      External environment can relate to aspects of Social; Economic; Technical; Political;
      Environmental; Legal; and Ethical factors (STEEPLE)
      • Social—potable water is now seen as a need, especially in LEDCs; short supply of
        high skilled and specialized employees in the UK (lines 68–69).
      • Economic—recession; consumer confidence; interest rates etc., all impact on SVT.
        Demand for wind turbines is expected to grow (line 80); market for desalination is
        growing rapidly (line 39).
      • Technical—innovations in engineering require SVT to seek out new methods of
        production and to enhance product development.
      • Political—political instability has led to many issues in poorer countries increasing the
        demand for SVT’s products.
      • Environmental—climate change has led to greater need for demand of potable water
        in many countries around the world.
      • Legal—safety regulations may have forced SVT to develop more effective and safer
        products.
      • Ethical—Stakeholders have a strong CSR approach leading to the development of the
         Outreach Programme.
      N.B. Only one answer can be accepted in each of the STEEPLE categories e.g only one
      economic factor can count.

      Accept any other relevant external environment factor and explanation.
      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer

      Award a maximum of [4] for limiting the explanation to only one external factor.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

      Award a maximum of [6] for a developed answer in context.

                                                 Section B


4.   (a)     Define the term profit centre.                                                        [2]

             A section of a business where both costs and revenues can be identified and
             are recorded.

             N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

             Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

             To gain both marks, answers must make refence to costs and revenues as well
             as some aspect or section of the business. The “section” is likely to refer to a
             department, a product, a process, a division etc.
             Be careful not to reward a “place” or an “area” unless this is clarified.

             Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
             understanding.

             Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar
             to the answer above.

     (b)     (i)    Using the reducing/declining balance method of depreciation, calculate the
             total depreciation of the automated monitoring equipment after a period of two
             years (show all your working).                                                        [2]

             Equipment cost $100m
             Value at end first year = 0.8 x 100m =$80m
             Value at end second year = 0.8 x $80m = $64m award [1]
             Amount of depreciation = $100m – $64m = $36m award [2]

             Alternative answer:

                  Year                     Depreciation                       Net book value
                   0                            $0                            $100 000 000
                   1             $20 000 000 ($100 000 000 x 20%)              $80 000 000
                   2             $16 000 000 ($80 000 000 x 20%)               $64 000 000
           Total depreciation              $36 000 000


             Award [2] for correct answer, with working and correct units.

             Award [1] for a reasonable attempt or absence of working and/or correct units.

             Award [1] for the calculation of $64m for net book value.

             Award [1] for an attempt, or for a correct answer that does not include the correct
             sign ($).
             Where there is no $ sign in the final answer give benefit of the doubt (BOD) if the
             $ sign is used in the working.

             Do not reward formula only.

(ii)       With reference to SVT’s automated monitoring equipment, explain one
           advantage of using the reducing/declining balance method of depreciation.
                                                                                  [2]

       •    This is a complex piece of technical equipment (automated monitoring
            equipment); very unlikely to deteriorate equally over time. Even more
            unlikely to have a useful life of ten years due to rapidly changing
            technology so will get close to its residual value early on.
       •    It matches the cost and revenue of the business, because the higher
            amount of depreciation provided in the early years is matched against the
            larger amount of revenue generated by the increased production brought
            about by the use of the new asset;
       •    it provides a more accurate measure of the depreciation compared to
            the straight-line method;
       •    it lowers the income tax expense in the early years.
            Accept any other relevant advantage.

            Award [1] for an appropriate advantage and an additional [1] for an
            explanation of how that advantage relates to SVT.

            [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation and / or
            application.
            There must be some reference to SVT’ equipment as well as the
            advantage of using this method of depreciation.

            For example:

            For an identification or a description of an advantage with or without
            application [1].

            For explanation of an advantage with no application [1].

            For explanation of an advantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain two ways in which effective contingency planning at SVT could have
      prevented the problems experienced in Dalgera.                      [4]

      Contingency planning involves:

      •   identifying potential disasters;
      •   assessing the likelihood of these disasters occurring;
      •   reducing the potential impact of the crises;
      •   planning for the continuous operations of the business;
      •   developing a post-disaster recovery plan.
      Solutions:

      •   improve the process of considering possible disasters;
      •   develop an action plan for each of these possible scenarios;
      •   set up improved and automatic reporting/investigation procedures;
      •   monitor, review, update levels of equipment and other resources;
      •   introduce training for dealing with crises;
      •   develop plans for how to return to normal working.
      To award [4] there must be some clear understanding of contingency planning in
      context.

      Award [3] if the answer shows two ways that SVT could have prevented the
      problems without specifically explaining contingency planning.

      Accept any other relevant ways.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for an appropriate way and an additional [1] for an explanation of how
      that way relates to SVT. Award a maximum of [2] for each way.

      [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation and / or
      application.

      For example:

      For an identification or a description of a way with or without application [1].

      For explanation of a way with no application [1].

      For explanation of a way and application [2].

(d)   With reference to SVT, evaluate the opportunities and threats posed by entering
      international markets.                                                               [10]

      Opportunities could include:

      • potential for greater brand image especially in LEDCs;
      • far greater markets to tap e.g. Asia;
      • economies of scale;
      • Asia has greater growth potential;
      • possibility of new locations for manufacturing;
      • diversification: an opportunity to spread risks by investing in other countries;
      • enhanced brand image: SVT can be perceived to be more successful than
        those that operate in the domestic market (brand prestige and loyalty);
      • forming new business relationships.
      Threats could include:

      • when things go wrong, there are repercussions worldwide;
      • problems partly caused by lower standards in Dalgera;
      • more difficult to manage;
      • social issues – problems would not have got out of hand in, for example, US,
        Europe where monitoring by television and society far greater;
      • political challenges;
      • law challenges: different countries = different laws;
      • fluctuating and different exchange rates and interest rates.
      Evaluation could relate to an assessment of the importance of the threats and
      opportunities and the specific impact on SVT. This could be related to specific
      threats and whether they might have an immediate or longer-term impact.

      Accept any other relevant evaluation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4 with further
      guidance below.

      Theoretical answer or context limited to naming the business or lack of
      development award a maximum of [4].

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is only on opportunities or threats.

      Award a maximum of [6] if the explanation only has one threat plus opportunities
      or one opportunity plus threats.

      Award a maximum of [8] if the response is balanced but lacks clear evaluation.

                                          Section C
5.   Using the case study and additional information on pages 4 and 5, recommend whether SVT
     should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                                     [20]

     Option 1

     Arguments for:

     •   maintains independence;
     •   relatively small investment?
     •   existing field of expertise;
     •   how does investment of $120 million relate to return of $0.5 million per turbine?

     Arguments against:

     • rather early and rapid expansion;
     • after providing the 30 turbines for the new desalination plant, will SVT find new
       customers to maintain the upgraded capacity? Will they be able to continue selling
       that quantity of turbines per year?
     • the new break-even seems to be very high (40 units). It is 66.66% of the total
       capacity;

     Option 2

     Arguments for:

     •   guarantees availability of new turbines;
     •   further possible collaboration;
     •   does ZAZ have new expertise?
     •   construction costs and risks will be shared.

     Arguments against:

     •   adverse publicity;
     •   loss of independence;
     •   must share operation fees;
     •   may depend on negotiated price for final five years of the project.

     Other factors:

     • What if they fail to complete the project on time and suffer the delay penalties?
     • 30% probability of paying $40 million and 10% chance of $80 million.
     • The investment is huge in both cases—do they want to do either? [assessment of
       risk].
     • Are there other financial considerations?
     • The need to finance any aspect of this investment?
     • How good is their forecasting of the data?
     • Some of the predictions are 15 + years away.
     • Are there external factors (change in the market; technology; etc.) that could change
       during the life of the project?

     Accept any other relevant recommendation.

N.B. if a candidate responds to this question without any reference to the
additional stimulus material (the additional material that comes with question 5 in
the examination paper), the maximum mark that the candidate can receive under
criteria A, B, C, and E (all the criteria except structure) is [2] per criterion. Award
a maximum of [12] overall.

Marks should be allocated according to the assessment criteria on pages 7-8 with
further guidance below.

Criterion A: possible theories, management tools and techniques include:
Accounting techniques and ratios, interpreting data, Decision Tree, Ansoff, Force
Field Analysis (FFA), importance of assumptions, also, possibly, fishbone, Boston
Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, marketing issues (market research, 4Ps),
HRM/management issues (leadership, motivation), SWOT (if used with a sense
of purpose).

For [4]: Tools, techniques and theory understood and developed well with some
relevance to the additional stimulus material.

For [2]: some understanding of at least two tools, techniques or theories, but not
developed.


Criterion B: the tools, techniques, theories and stimulus applied to the
decision. Application will be judged by the use of the stimulus material.

Remember, understanding has been rewarded in Criterion A. So B is about USE.

For [4]: relevant tools, techniques and theories are applied well to the case study
context and additional stimulus material, the application is convincing and
relevant.

For [2]: some limited context/application but not developed. Use of tools limits
candidate’s ability to make reasoned arguments.

Criterion C: options discussed in balanced way, conclusions drawn and
recommendation made/supported.

For [4]: there needs to be a clear recommendation supported by the data.

For [2]: some limited arguments but not justified. Or limited analysis (eg one-
sided argument) but candidate arrives/draws a reasoned conclusion.
                                       – 17 –              M23/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Criterion D: Structure: this criterion assesses the extent to which the candidate
organizes his or her ideas with clarity, and presents a structured piece of writing
comprised of:

• an introduction
• a concluding paragraph. Please note this can be different from the concept of
a conclusion/recommendation in Criterion C. D can be rewarded without a
recommendation.
• fit-for-purpose paragraphs. This means: not too long, each focused on distinct
issues;
• logical structure. This means whether there is a clear flow to guide the reader
through the discussion, how the paragraphs are sequenced.

For [4]: all four elements present, clearly organized.

For [2]: no logical structure but other elements present or logical structure with
other elements missing.


Criterion E: Stakeholders:
• individuals: SVT directors, production director;
• groups: foreign government, the board of directors, competitors, ZAZ.

For [4]: individual(s) and group(s) are considered in a balanced way. i.e needs one
or more of both individuals and groups developed.

For [2]: one individual or one group considered appropriately, or several individuals
and/or groups considered superficially.

Award [0] if no stakeholders are considered.
