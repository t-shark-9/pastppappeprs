1.     (a)   Explain why, in monopolistic competition, abnormal profits can be made only in the short run.
                                                                                                      [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: monopolistic competition, short run, abnormal profit, barriers to entry.
             • Explanation: of the short run profit-maximizing position with abnormal profit being
               made; and of the long run position being affected by entry of new firms, resulting in
               decrease in demand for existing firms, with abnormal profits being eliminated and
               normal profits eventually being made.
             • Diagram: short run and long run monopolistic competition diagrams.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the view that monopolistic competition is a
      more desirable market structure than oligopoly.                                            [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: monopolistic competition, oligopoly.
      • Explanation: of the view in terms of the possible benefits of monopolistic competition
        as compared to oligopoly; eg less market power for producers who face more elastic
        demand curves, more product variety, freedom of entry for new firms, normal profits
        in the long run; and in terms of the drawbacks of oligopoly such as collusion and the
        possibility of higher prices.
      • Diagram: collusive oligopoly diagram showing more significant market power
        compared to monopolistic competition; relevant use of monopolistic competition
        diagrams (less market power).
      • Synthesis (discuss): a challenge to the view in terms of the possible advantages of
        oligopoly over monopolistic competition, such as economies of scale and R&D; non-
        colluding oligopolies can be allocatively more efficient than monopolistically
        competitive firms in case of a price war; benefits for consumers of non-price
        competition (eg advertising) occurring more significantly in oligopoly.
      • Examples: real-world examples of markets which are characterized by either
        monopolistic competition or oligopoly and their benefits or drawbacks.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already been
      given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      • Explanation: of how expansionary monetary policy can be used to counter a
        deflationary gap using the various tools of monetary policy, such as open market

        central bank’s minimum lending rate.
      • Diagram: AD/AS diagram to show AD shifting right with the deflationary gap being
        closed/eliminated.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): evaluation of the effectiveness of monetary policy in terms of
        the limitations, eg limited scope for lowering interest rates when close to zero, low
        consumer confidence, ineffective in relation to structural unemployment and the
        possibility of greater inflation; and its strengths, eg short time lags, incremental,

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: economically least developed country, economic growth.
      • Explanation: of the view in terms of how various aspects of the institutional
        framework such as poorly-functioning legal system, ineffective/inequitable taxation
        structure, underdeveloped banking system and lack of property rights may act as a
        barrier to economic growth.
      • Diagram: a diagram is not required for this question, but candidates may use a
        LRAS/PPC diagram to illustrate economic growth in the long run and explain that
        the weak institutional framework is preventing economic growth from happening.
      • Synthesis (discuss): a challenge to the view in terms of the relative significance of
        other economic and social/political barriers.
      • Examples: real-world examples of countries facing a weak institutional framework
        and/or other barriers to economic growth.

   7–9     • The response indicates understanding of the specific demands of the question,
