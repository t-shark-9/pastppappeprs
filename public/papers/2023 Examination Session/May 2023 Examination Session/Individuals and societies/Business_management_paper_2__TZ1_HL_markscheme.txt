                                                     Section A

1.     (a)       State two disadvantages of operating at high-capacity utilization.                             [2]

             •      Activity is rushed. Quality may be affected.
             •      Employees may be overworked; could also be demotivating if it is continued for long.
             •      High stress from the demanding tempo of operations leading to potential errors.
             •      New orders or potential new customers may have to be turned away; unable to meet
                    an unexpected increase in demand because they are already working at full capacity.
             •      There is less time for quality control.
             •      Resources are strained.
             •      Safety procedures may be compromised.
             •      Less time for machinery maintenance leading to breakdowns.

             Accept any other relevant disadvantage.
             N.B. no description is required.
             Award [1] for each appropriate disadvantage stated. Candidates are not expected to give full
             reasoning for each point above. Award a maximum of [2] for any two relevant disadvantages.
             Do not award [2] if the two points are just an elaboration of the same disadvantage.

     (b)     Calculate:

             (i)      JT’s annual depreciation expense if it uses the straight-line method (show all your
                      working);                                                              [2]

                      (Purchase price minus residual value)/useful life of asset in years
                      (£120 000 - £20 000)/4 = £25 000

                      Award [1] for the correct workings and [1] for the correct answer.
                      Deduct [1] if no £ sign (this can appear in the working and/or the final answer).
                      Allow benefit of the doubt (BOD) if candidate use a $ sign.

             (ii)     the residual value of the new truck if JT uses the reducing/declining balance method
                      and chooses a depreciation rate of 35% (show all your working).                   [4]

                       Year           Depreciation allowance            Net book value £
                       1 (2024)       £120 000 x 0.35 = £42 000         £78 000
                       2 (2025)       £78 000 x 0.35 = £27 300          £50 700
                       3 (2026)       £50 700 x 0.35 = £17 745          £32 955
                       4 (2027)       £32 955 x 0.35 = £11 534          £21 421

                      The residual value is £21 420.75 or £21 421 (Allow rounding)

                      Candidates are expected to produce for each year a clear calculation of the end-of-year net
                      book value. Award [1] for the correct net book value at the end of each year up to [4].
                      Candidates do not have to present in a table format (as above) to be awarded [4].

                      Candidates can be awarded marks even if the terms net book value or depreciation
                      allowance are not explicitly written as long as the calculations are clear. If a candidate
                      writes the correct end-of-year net book values but does not show working, award a
                      maximum of [2].
                      If the candidate incorrectly calculates any one year, but carries forward to future year
                      calculations, then deduct [1] for that year and allow candidate own figure rule (OFR) for
                      future years.
                      Deduct [1] if no £ sign (unless already deducted in (b)(i)). Allow benefit of the doubt (BOD)
                      if candidate uses a $ sign.
                                             –7–                M23/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M



           In the alternative, candidates may choose to answer the question with the following
           formula:
           Depreciation rate = 1 - n√ (residual value/cost of fixed assets)
           n = number of years.
           Thus:
           0.35 = 1 - ∜ (residual value/£120 000)
           ∜ (residual value/£120 000) = 1 – 0.35
           ∜ (residual value/£120 000) = 0.65
           residual value/120 000 = (0.65) ⁴
           residual value = 0.1785 x £120 000
           Residual Value = £21 420.75 = £21 421 (same correct answer)

           Or the same formula, but presented in the following format:

           Residual value = Original value x (1 – Depreciation rate)n
           n = number of years.

           Thus:
           Residual value = £120 000 x (1 – 0.35)4
           Residual value = £120 000 x (0.65)4
           Residual value = £120 000 x 0.1785
           Residual value = £21 420.75 = £21 421 (same correct answer)

           Award [1] for the correct answer and [3] for correct demonstration of working:
           an additional [1] for writing 0.35 = 1 - ∜ (residual value/£120 000)
           or writing
           Residual value = £120 000 x (1-0.35)4

           And an additional [1–2] for showing the remainder of the working. Deduct [1] if no £
           sign (unless already deducted in (b)(i)). Allow benefit of the doubt (BOD) if candidate
           uses a $ sign.

(c)   Explain one reason why JT should use the reducing/reclining balance method.              [2]

      For both financial and non-financial reasons, JT should probably use the reducing balance
      method.
      The financial reason: JT is anticipating higher sales revenue and profits in years 1 and 2.
      By using the reducing balance method of depreciation, in years 1 and 2, JT will have higher
      depreciation expense than if using the straight-line method. As a result, JT’s pre-tax
      profits will be lower (than if using the straight-line method), which will also lower JT’s
      income tax expense in those years.
      The non-financial reason: If JT does have higher trading activity in years 1 and 2, the
      truck will be used more in those first two years than in subsequent years. Thus,
      depreciating the asset more in the early years means that the actual loss in value of the truck
      aligns better with how the asset is being depreciated on the books. It provides a more
      accurate measure of depreciation compared to the straight-line method, especially in the
      valuation of assets over the years.

      Award [1] mark for stating either the financial reason or the non-financial reason. Award an
      additional [1] for a clear and full explanation relating to JG on the reason provided.
      For a purely theoretical answer with no reference to JT other than by name award [1].

2.   (a)   State two features of a private limited company.                             [2]

           Features of a private limited company include:
           • Sale of shares is restricted to those approved by existing shareholders.
           • No risk of hostile takeover.
           • Shareholders have limited liability.
           • Less paperwork, reporting responsibility, and compliance costs than a publicly traded
             company.
           • Legal continuity.
           • No legal obligation to release accounts to the public giving greater privacy.
           Accept any other relevant feature.
           Award [1] for each appropriate feature stated. Award a maximum of [2].

           N.B. do not accept features e.g. easier to raise finance - if no reference to comparison i.e.
           sole trader OR faster decisions compared to PLC.

           both mathematical errors and conceptual errors (for example, salary as inflows, it is one
           error). N.B. in above example if candidate omits the increase in salary in April this is a
           second error and candidates should only lose [1] for that error. Allow rounding. Some
           candidates may place “opening balance” at the top of the cash-flow.
           If candidate includes assets sales as revenue (this is penalized) but the subsequent error in
           delivery charges is not a separate error as OFR applies.

      Award [1] if the candidate has some idea of what a cash-flow forecast is and looks like.

      Award [2] for a cash-flow forecast that has some problems in layout and wording and which
      has more than three errors/mistakes (apply OFR), which could include in addition to number
      placement problems and mathematical errors, or conceptual errors, or omissions, such as
      not having a line like “closing balance”.

      Award [3] for a largely correct cash-flow forecast that has some minor problems with layout,
      wording and calculations, which has three mistakes (apply OFR).

      Award [4] for a largely correct cash-flow forecast that has some minor problems with layout
      and wording and which has up to two mistakes (apply OFR) or the candidate does not
      produce a mathematically correct cash flow.

      Award [5] for a mathematically correct cash-flow forecast that has up to one calculation error,
      or some omission of the wording above.

      Award [6] for a fully correct cash-flow forecast with a generally accepted format and lines for
      total inflows/receipts, total outflows/payments (or some other acceptable wording), a line for
      net cash flow/inflow, etc., and lines for opening and closing balance.

      N.B. Substituting the term “net profit” in the cash-flow forecast for “net cash-flow” is
      inaccurate and [1] should be deducted.

(c)   Comment on the predicted cash flow for MSC for the first four months of 2024.                [2]

      The seemingly solid cashflow of MSC is deceptive. Though Tony forecasts the closing
      cash balance to increase by 50% in the four months of 2024, a significant portion of that
      increase is due to the receipts of funds from the sale of used equipment. Without those
      funds from the sale of equipment, the closing cash balance decreased by 7.14%.
      Two other factors also indicate that MSC’s forecasted cashflow is not as promising as the
      first four months of 2024 suggest. First, the market is increasingly competitive, which
      could put pressure on MSC to lower its prices, which would lower sales revenue, or MSC
      could even lose sales altogether.

      Second, with Tony’s 16.66% pay rise, cash outflows increase by $1000 starting April 1.
      As the situation is currently forecasted, in the first three months of 2024, MSC will have an
      average monthly positive cash flow from ordinary operations (that is, not including the sale of
      used equipment) of $750. A 16.66% pay rise for Tony would mean that, starting in April,
      average monthly cashflow from ordinary operations over a 3-month period would be -
      $250.

      Award [1] if the candidate comments that the cashflow does appear sound. Award an
      additional [1] if the candidate comments and explains why the cashflow from ordinary
      operations (not including the sale of used equipment in March) is weaker than it appears (the
      candidate elaborates on either the increasingly competitive market and its potential impact
      on cashflow or on the impact that the intended pay rise will have on the cashflow).
      Award a maximum of [1] if candidate uses the term profit instead of cashflow.

                                              Section B

3.   (a)   Define the term branding.                                                             [2]

           Branding is the process of distinguishing one firm´s product from another
           using features such as brand name, logo, design etc.. The process establishes an
           identity that distinguishes it from the competition.

           N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding
           similar to the above answer. The first mark would come from the idea that it a
           process that tries to connect in the consumers mind, a product to a name or logo.
           The second mark comes from identifying the ability to distinguish the product
           from the competition. Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge
           and understanding similar to the answer above.

           There is no credit for using an example or mentioning DWT.

(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for DWT of expanding into online tuition in
      Asia.                                                                            [4]

      Dean is considering offering online tutoring to countries across the world, especially Asia. He
      has previously only offered the services of DWT locally and face-to-face. This move is
      therefore a radical change for DWT.

      Advantages:
      There is a good chance of increased revenues both in terms of value and volume since
      • DTW’s market will be developed beyond their current customer base, as it seems that
        there is a large market, particularly in China, for DWT`s service.
      • Given that Dean simply takes a commission from work carried out by his team of tutors,
        the online expansion to Asia might be seen as less risky than other developments e.g.
        he is not undertaking the training himself.
      • The online expansion may lead to further growth beyond Asia as the move embraces
        changes in technology, and the nature of customer demand, which has led to a worldwide
        growth of online learning.
      • In terms of value, DWT has also good chances of increasing their income, as in Asia
        tuition fees are paid three times more than in country X.

      Disadvantages:
      • Asia is a new market for DWT. They have no obvious links (and experience) and DTW
         might find it hard to generate demand.
      • DTW would be very reliant on the quality of the local agents.
      • DTW may need to invest in training and IT equipment. Dean may become stretched by
         trying to manage both aspects of the business.
      • Language culture and legal issues may be significant especially based on the
         reasonable assumption that DWT are not currently based in Asia.
      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified and [1] for a relevant
      explanation with application to DWT. Award up to a maximum of [2].
      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response lacks either explanation
      and / or application.


      For example:

      For an identification or a description of an advantage / disadvantage with or without
      application [1].

      For explanation of an advantage / disadvantage with no application [1].

      For explanation of an advantage / disadvantage and application [2].

      It is NOT application if candidate simply repeats the question, e.g. online tuition in Asia is
      mentioned in the question.

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Dean of drawing a Gantt chart to
      assist his planning for the expansion to online tuition.                 [4]

      A Gantt chart is a diagram in which a series of horizontal lines shows the amount of work
      done or production completed in certain periods of time in relation to the amount planned for
      those periods. As a planning tool it helps to allocate individual activities in a project and to
      show how long each should take and the order with which they should be completed.
      By drawing up the Gantt chart he could have a clear idea of what he needs to achieve
      in the time available.

      Advantages:
      • Gantt chart could help Dean to have a clear picture of the overall project and of the
        current progress of tasks. The chart will allow him to consider each task that needs to
        be completed. For example, he will need to contact the agents in Asia and either recruit
        new tutors, train the existing tutors (or both). He might need to source IT equipment etc.
      • A Gantt chart could help Dean to work out the duration of each task and decide what
        is needed to be done and in what order. This should reduce the wasted time in both
        planning and execution of the plan. This is important as with the new school year
        starting in China, Dean will need to act quickly.
      • Helps to assess any potential problems and even determine whether the plan of
        delivering online tuition is ultimately viable in the short timescale to meet the beginning of
        the new school year in China.

      Disadvantages:
      • The Gantt chart may become very complex. Dean is completely new to the venture of
         online tuition he is embarking on with DWT. The chart could be very difficult to draw up
         given Dean may not necessarily identify ALL the specific tasks required.
      • Working effectively, a Gantt chart often needs to be updated. A key issue for Dean may
         well be the costs involved in online tuition delivery. Gantt charts rarely include costs as a
         variable (based on mainly qualitative data).
      • Dean is probably not experienced in drawing up Gantt charts. He may spend too
         much time on the chart rather than getting on with the actual tasks. Dean must act fast
         due to the imminent start of the new school year in China. He needs to have DWT
         ready to access the markets in Asia and there is much to plan.
      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage. The key here is application for full
      marks.

      Accept application of advantages/disadvantages in relation to the actual processes carried out
      by Dean. e.g. identifying the sequence in the recruitment steps, which can or cannot be carried
      out simultaneously.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified and [1] for a relevant
      explanation with application to DWT. Award up to a maximum of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response lacks either explanation
      and / or application.

      For example:
      For an identification or a description of an advantage/disadvantage with or without application
      [1].
      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no application [1].
      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   Recommend whether Dean should choose Option 1 or Option 2 to ensure that he
      has enough tutors for the expansion to online tuition.                [10]

      Dean has two options listed in the question. In practice, he may have others.

      Option 1:

      Offer training and support to the existing tutors. The advantages of going for this
      approach include the opportunity to make use of the employees who have worked with
      Dean up to now. This staff will be fully aware of the DWT‘s “code of conduct”, Dean’s
      leadership style and will therefore know how Dean likes to operate.

      In addition, Dean knows his existing tutors well, having reviewed on a weekly basis their
      performance and student feedback. He will likely have a good idea which tutors are better
      suited to the new online environment.

      By offering additional training and other support there may be an improvement in morale.
      Tutors will feel valued and tutor’s motivation may be improved at DWT. Dean will
      additionally be able to continue to exercise some face-to-face control over the tutors. Good
      responses may refer to Herzberg and other motivation theorists even if explicit reference to
      any motivation theory is not expected.

      However,

      Disadvantages include the cost of providing the support, the cost of the training and the
      time involved in making this happen. The existing tutors, who are used to face-to-face
      teaching, may not be effective in online teaching situations anyway. This option is also
      time consuming as training could take months when Dean must act fast. Developing online
      teaching materials can also be time consuming unless purchased from an outside developer
      where an additional cost may be problematic.

      The online tutoring market in Asia, particularly in China, is large. Training the existing ten
      tutors who have been working part-time may not be sufficient to meet the demand. These
      part-time tutors, who are demotivated by regular, weekly feedback may not be motivated by
      additional workload or change in work practices.

      Option 2:

      Recruit new tutors from anywhere in the world with online teaching experience. The
      advantage of this approach is that it will increase the pool of tutors available within DWT.
      Tutors who apply for this role will clearly be keener to operate in this way (online) and may
      be more motivated and/or have more experience. By widening the recruitment search to
      international staff, Dean should have access to tutors who speak a range of languages and
      possibly have a better understanding of local cultures. The costs involved will only relate
      to the actual costs of recruitment. This could be carried out online. Recruiting is likely to
      be less costly and less time consuming than the other option. Tutors appointed could be
      recruited from anywhere in the world. This may help with time zone issues etc.
                                        – 14 –                 M23/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Disadvantages include the uncertainty of trying to appoint staff when you are unsure about
exactly what might be required. Tutors appointed will have to accept the flexibility of giving
up a commission payment to Dean which they may not be happy with. Knowing where to
advertise these positions to maximize the quality of the candidates might also be an issue.
Tutors will have to quickly understand and follow the DWT code of conduct and Dean’s
leadership style. There is no guarantee that newly appointed tutors will adhere to this. If the
online tutors are paid more, it could generate clashes with the current tutors.

Dean may have problems in monitoring tutors who are based in different time zones.

New online tutors may come with a range of online materials and activities giving rise to a
problem of standardizing the quality of the learning experiences for students.

Dean must weigh up what the best option will be. Both ideas have merit, but the question
specifically focusses on ‘…Dean should choose to best ensure…’. The “best ensure” allows
discussion highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of both options.

When making a judgment, strong answers may focus on the need to balance getting the best
tutors available, with the costs. Dean is on something of a tight schedule to ensure that he has
enough staff to cope with the possible demands of the new term. He has to avoid the possibility of
not having enough tutors available.

The training option will be good for the existing tutors but may not help to ensure that the tutor
team is large enough if the business expands. The question also allows the consideration of
using either option or a combination of both. Dean could train his existing tutors and assess
whether they would be interested in the new online working. Additional new tutors could be used
to cope with the likely increased demand in addition to this.

Accept any relevant and applicable argument for and against each option.

Candidates are expected to provide a conclusion with a substantiated judgment.

Accept any substantiated evaluation/judgment/recommendation.

Marks should be allocated         according      to   the   markbands   on   page   3   with

judge the weightings applied to each driving and restraining force.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3].

For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

If a candidate evaluates/addresses only one option, award a maximum of [5].

A balanced response is one that provides one argument for and one argument against each option.

Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance, as long as at least two arguments
are given for each option.

Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced analysis
and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus material
but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions that
are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the
           answer above. I.e. the group of customers that a company wants to sell to. The second mark
           could come from the specification that customers have common needs and wants or that it
           helps to define the business’ marketing strategy such as promotion.

(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of paying commission to sales
      staff working in its shops.                                              [4]

      Commission makes reference to the payment to employees after finishing a particular
      task such as selling a number of products or services (employees are paid by results).
      However, in addition to their sales commissions employees are usually paid a (sometimes
      low) basic salary. Paying commission has advantages and disadvantages to LA:

      It is important that responses focus on the affects to LA. Do not reward responses that focus
      on the advantages/disadvantages to staff.

      Advantages:
      • motivates employees to work harder. LA pays commission to sales staff working in
        physical shops. Employees, driven by income, can make an extra effort to sell more
        clothes. This is particularly important to boost LA’s sales in physical shops that have
        fallen after LA’s online shop was launched;
      • commissions are tied to sales so, if there are no sales there are no commission
        costs. As LA only pays commissions to workers in physical shops where sales have
        fallen, cost reductions can be substantial.

      Disadvantages:
      • customers can be driven away by pressure from sales people. Customer service
         quality could be undermined. LA could lose customers that value a good personalized
         sales service;
      • employees may be tempted to sell products that are not in the best interests of the
         customer or business; this could in turn affect the developed brand awareness and
         customer value for LA’s personalized service.
      • as sales in physical shops are falling, sales staff would receive less commission
         leading to demotivation and perhaps increased labour turnover at LA that so far has
         been low.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Do not accept as a disadvantage - less profits for LA, since if commission payment was
      NOT used then presumably fixed salaries would have to be increased.

      Similarly, do not accept something to the effect of “increased costs”, since with a correctly
      structured commission system, the increase in revenue generated from the commission
      system is greater than the cost of the commissions.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified and [1] for a relevant
      explanation with application to LA. Award up to a maximum of [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of Marie’s democratic leadership
      style.                                                                        [4]

      Democratic leadership style is such that promotes an active participation of employees in
      decision making and informs them about issues that affect them.

      Advantages:
      • employees feel more committed to the potential changes and decisions if they are involved
        in the business decision-making process. LA will have to decide whether to sell online only or
        not. If LA employees are involved in this decision there are higher chances that they will
        embrace the resulting solution whichever it is and lower chances of conflict;
      • motivation levels are enhanced leading to commitment. This is evident in LA as there is low
        labour turnover;
      • better final decisions could be made as the staff has much to say and could give very
        valuable experience. For example, Marie consulted the e-commerce department who have
        suggested investing in software that could help online customers to find their correct clothing
        size (reducing cost of returns) and thus help decide whether to go online only or not;
      • lack of conflict between LA’s managers and employee representatives is possibly due to
        Marie’s democratic leadership style and her regular meetings with staff.

      Disadvantages:
      A democratic leadership style can be time consuming. Attending meetings and consulting
      employees, can slow down the decision-making processes at LA.

      Some decisions such as closing down shops could be very difficult for a democratic
      leader like Marie to make. It is unlikely that Marie will decide in a democratic way whether to close
      the LA physical shops or not, because there is a conflict of interests unlikely to be resolved.
      Marie would not be able to decide this in a meeting with her managers. There is a potential
      conflict between Marie and LA employees that would be difficult to resolve. If LA closes all her
      shops many employees will be made redundant. This could erode LA’s organizational culture
      used to democratic leadership style. Seems not to be good for LA? (never had conflict before).

      Marie’s democratic style may see her wish to avoid conflict at all cost (there has never been any
      conflict) resulting in her making decisions which may not be in the best interest of LA.

      A democratic style is unlikely to hear arguments with equal weight, especially when a PLC like LA
      is likely to give greater stakeholder weight to that of shareholders.

(d)   Discuss whether LA should close all its physical shops and sell only online. [10]

      Candidates can structure their answers in two different ways. They can view “close
      retail + sell online” as one issue and provide two arguments for and two against.
      Alternatively, candidates can talk about advantage and disadvantage of “closing”,
      then advantage and disadvantage of “all online”. Either approach is acceptable.

      Possible advantages of LA closing all its physical shops and sell only online:

      • if LA closes all physical shops, important cost reductions could be made. For instance,
        LA will make savings in sale commission paid to sales staff in physical shops and in the
        cost of wages that are above the industry average;
      • LA will also gain in other costs reductions such as leasing costs from physical shops. It
        will also gain in flexibility, as online selling has lower fixed costs;
      • another advantage of having an online business is that you break the physical barriers
        and do not depend on the number of people passing by your street or the number of
        brochures you have delivered to mailboxes;
      • low costs involved in marketing products abroad;
      • from the internet (online) you can sell to a global market (global reach);
      • LA could sell its physical shops to raise finance as well.

      However,

      • Selling online only can be a dangerous move as it lowers visibility. Physical shops allow
        clients to see the products, which facilitates purchasing decisions. Further, a physical
        store offers a sense of security to the clients. Hence, clients will trust you more when
        they are aware you operate from a physical place they can access. If you have an online
        presence, a physical store will complement your marketing efforts;
      • customers at LA are used to personalized assistance. Buying online is a totally
        different experience; this is evidenced by the increasing number of returns experienced by
        LA;
      • physical shops assist customers that like personalized customer service. Online
        selling does not quite match the target market of customers that value personalized
        customer service even if online sales are increasing;
      • return costs from online sales are increasing. LA will have to invest in new software to
        cope with sizing problems;
      • the buying experience of clothes is different online than in physical shops;
      • employee redundancies can damage LA’s working environment (and LA corporate
        image) and clash with the CEO´s democratic leadership style and LA’s organizational
        culture. Potential conflicts with employees and employee representatives;
      • LA may be left paying leases on shops it closes;
      • online selling is not without investment costs – technology equipment, warehousing, hiring
        staff with online experience, online marketing, scheduling and delivery systems etc..

      All in all, it seems that closing all shops is too drastic. LA already has incurred setting up
      costs of an important number of shops, they could take the advantages of online selling but
      still keep some physical shops, or phasing out those underperforming stores on a more
      gradual basis.

5.   (a)   Define the term process innovation.                                                       [2]

           A process innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved or
           modified production or delivery methods. This includes significant changes in
           production techniques, equipment and/or software and delivery that bring benefits from
           the innovation.

           N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding, like
           including improved production or delivery method. Award [2] for a full definition that
           conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the answer above, which would
           include that some benefit accrues from the innovation e.g. time, cost, quality,
           efficiency etc. benefits do not need to be listed.

           Do NOT reward candidates that simply define “innovation” or “product innovation”. Also
           do not reward responses such as “Process innovation is changing or improving a
           process in a business” - this is too vague. There must be some reference to either
           production or delivery.

(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for RC of using a price-skimming
      strategy for the coffee sold in booths served by robots.                              [4]

      Price skimming is the strategy of charging a relatively high price during the
      launch of a new product and then lowering the price over time as demand declines
      and/or new competition enters the market. Skimming is a useful pricing strategy for
      businesses in innovative spaces where demand is extremely high for early-
      adoption.

      Advantages include:
      • One advantage for RC of using price-skimming strategy is that it will have a higher
        return on investment for the barista robots. RC will benefit from short-term
        profits during the introduction, and the initial higher prices are justified by the
        technological innovation.
      • Another advantage is that consumers associate the high price with a high-value
        or high-quality product (e.g., premium fair trade organic coffee) and enhanced
        brand image. It would help RC to maintain its image and reputation.
      • The higher profits from using price-skimming may help appease shareholders if it
        shortens the time during which they continue to receive no dividends

      Disadvantages include:
      • One possible disadvantage is that the price skimming strategy will only work if the
         change in price does not have a greater effect on RC’s demand for coffee. If it
         does, then high prices could hurt RC’s sales. Right now, RC’s sales are already
         declining and competitors are being drawn to the market. If RC’s customers are
         not ready to pay more for a robotized service, then sales will drop.
      • If a price-skimming strategy is to be used first and only in robotized booths, one
         could argue that RC will have to increase prices in their human managed booths as
         well. Higher prices may discourage some customers from buying the product.
      • In times of economic downturn, it could be a risky move to increase or skim the price
         of a product such as coffee, that can be easily substituted by similar brands.
         Customers could buy similar and cheaper coffee in other shops/booths even if they
         are not served by robot baristas.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified and [1] for a relevant
      explanation with application to RC. Award up to a maximum of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and / or application.

      For example:

      For an identification or a description of an advantage/disadvantage with or without
      application [1].

      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no application [1].

      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for RC of setting ethical objectives.        [4]

      One advantage for RC of setting ethical objectives is to create a positive image.
      Right now, the protests against businesses like RC have damaged their
      (corporate image) and sales. Setting ethical objectives might be a good way to turn
      things around. Buying large quantities of Fair Trade “Organic” coffee is an example
      of both being fair in their business dealings and investing in a perceived eco-friendlier
      version of coffee.

      A second advantage is that having ethical objectives may help to differentiate from
      competitors such as Coffee Extra (CE) who have a reputation for poor working
      conditions and low salaries.

      An ethical image may enable premium prices to be more readily accepted by
      customers leading to better profits and hence eventual dividends to shareholders.

      It can create employee motivation and improve morale (for [1] there is no application in
      the stimulus to support).

      One disadvantage for RC of setting ethical objectives could be that, although in the
      long run it may be beneficial, in the short term there are costs that will rise when
      implementing the payment for the grants towards future training of employees and
      enhanced redundancy payments.

      Secondly the additional costs from an ethical stance depends to what extent its target
      market are price sensitive. Customers may not care for the ethical stance if it makes
      their coffee too expensive.

      There may be some customer backlash if RC’s ethical objectives are seen at odds with
      their policy of replacing staff with robots.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for each correct advantage / disadvantage identified and [1] for a relevant
      explanation with application to RC. Award up to a maximum of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and / or application.

      For example:

      For an identification or a description of an advantage/disadvantage with or without
      application [1].

      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no application [1].

      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   Recommend whether RC should accept CE’s offer.                                           [10]

      The board of directors is not sure whether to accept CE’s offer to acquire RC.
      RC has definitely gotten into an area (robots) where speed of growth is a priority, which
      could be an argument in favour of the takeover by the coffee chain. The coffee chain CE
      clearly has expertise since they are already known for using drones for delivering coffee
      (workplace automation). CE is offering to pay them twice the value. They can cash-in
      and start another company, given that within the market, although expected to grow,
      competition is increasing. If customers are discouraged to pay for more expensive coffee
      for the robotized novelty, RC may not be able to keep the skimming pricing strategy which
      could in turn jeopardize RC’s profits and dividends. Then CE could become a financial
      alternative.

      Some shareholders may not be happy with the reduction in their dividends for the last two
      years. This policy is likely to continue into the future, representing an incentive to sell.

      Furthermore, the novelty factor and high prices are easier for customers to accept during a
      buoyant economy, but less acceptable when faced with recessionary forces.

      By the same token, RC is known for excellent quality and consistency in coffee, and
      customers could be attracted by the novelty of the process and they could tap into that
      value. The market is expected to grow, they have a high-profit margin and currently
      enjoy first-mover advantage. A price-skimming strategy will help RC recover the cost of
      the innovative process with the robots, the implementation of which may become cheaper
      over time as they become more experienced. Alternatively, they could evaluate how to
      grow rather than to sell. Contrary to CE’s bad reputation with their employees, RC’s
      current CSR (purchasing fair trade) and strong ethical objectives (enhanced redundancy
      payments and funding for training) could work in their favour. Selling to CE may collide
      with RC’s ethical values because CE pays low salaries to employees and provides poor
      working conditions.

      Accept any other relevant arguments for and against accepting CE’s offer.

      To sum up: candidates can recommend whether RC should accept CE’s offer or not
      provided it is well substantiated.

      Candidates are expected to provide a conclusion with a substantiated judgement.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further
      guidance below.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3].
      For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].
      If a candidate evaluates/addresses only one option, award a maximum of [5].

      A balanced response is one that provides at least one argument for and one argument
      against each option.

      Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance as long as at least two
      arguments are given for each option.

      Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced analysis
      and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus material
      but there is no judgment/conclusion.

      Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions that
      are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.
      It is expected that the candidate goes beyond just providing some relevant arguments for or
      against any suggested strategy and finish off with some conclusions and judgment.

                                               Section C

Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on pages 4–5.

6.   With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which change can
     influence marketing strategy.                                                    [20]

7.   With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
     business ethics.                                                                  [20]


8.   With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization and
     culture on human resource management.                                              [20]

     N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still expected
     that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the second
     concept (the one being acted on).

     Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to be
     based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

     Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria

     For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained
     by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect of a level
     descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

      •   The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable by
          a candidate.
      •   A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily reach
          high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

     If only one concept is addressed:
     • Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
     • Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

     Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
     unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept may
     be more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.


Criterion C
1 + 1 arguments are expected per concept.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are all
   one-sided then this would be unjustified.
• For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located between
   the introduction and the conclusion.
• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
   example, one idea per paragraph.


Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with specific
   explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
• Please do not use the adjective ‘inappropriate’ in the descriptor for [2]. If inappropriate award
   [1].

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A and B
and in the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to questions 6,
7 and 8. When this happens, please award marks as follows:

Criterion A: award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant if the
organization is fictitious.
Criterion B: award [0] – there is no connection to a “real-world organization”
Criterion C: award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is
fictitious.
Criterion D: mark as normal.
Criterion E: award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be
relevant if the organization is fictitious.
