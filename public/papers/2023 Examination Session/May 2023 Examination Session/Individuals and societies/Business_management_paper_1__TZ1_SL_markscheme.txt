                                              Section A
1.   (a)   Outline two disadvantages for SVT’s employees of the new flexible-working contract (lines
           60–62).                                                                        [4]


           Disadvantages include:
           • The employees would have to accept change following many years of operating in an
              unchanged way.
           • The older employees, who are mostly rejecting the change, are very used to working
              from 8am to 5pm (line 53).
           • The shift pattern is happening alongside other modernization programmes. The
              employees may be objecting to the whole package.
           • SVT lost a significant number of experienced employees because of this change
              (25% left (line 63)). Newer staff lost the chance to work with experienced colleagues.
           • The employees would have to change the hours they worked every six months (line
              62). They may not like this pattern.
           Accept any other relevant disadvantage
           Mark as 2 + 2.
           Award [1] for each appropriate disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for a description
           of how it impacts on the employees of SVT.

           Award a maximum of [2] for each disadvantage.

           Award a maximum of [4] in total.

     (b)   Explain the factors that SVT should consider when deciding on a pricing strategy
           for the WF15 water purifier (lines 126–131).                                     [6]

           Factors include:
           • Likely market demand—Demand could be very high given the ease of using the product
             in different situations (a few hours of sunlight) (line 124).
           • Production and other costs—the WF15 had to meet strict criteria in terms of cost
             suggesting it is relatively inexpensive.
           • SVT’s objectives—should it be a not-for-profit product? (lines 127–128).
           • Directors—some feel that the product should be subsidized to make it affordable. Not
             all directors feel this though (lines 128–129).
           • Other stakeholders such as shareholders may wish to maximize profits.
           • Competitors prices—SVT may wish to examine the price charged by competitors to
             establish a benchmark price for themselves.


           Accept any other relevant factor and explanation.
           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer

           Award a maximum of [4] for limiting the explanation to only one factor.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

           Award a maximum of [6] for a developed answer in context

2.   (a)   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage for SVT of Ariadne’s leadership
           style (lines 21–26).                                                                         [4]

           Ariadne displays an autocratic leadership style.
           Advantages:
           • This may have led to higher productivity per employee (lines 23–24).
           • Ariadne is the sole decision-maker meaning that decisions are made quickly to
              respond to quickly unexpected changes. This fits in with the directors having operational
              and tactical authority (line 15).
           Disadvantages:
           • Ariadne often has different priorities, and this has led to conflict with Yannick (lines
              25–26).
           • Ariadne can be inflexible.
           • Ariadne can make poor decisions leading to weaker performance for SVT.
           Mark as 2 + 2.
           Award [1] for each appropriate advantage/disadvantage identified and an additional
           [1] for a description of how it impacts on SVT.

           Award a maximum of [2] per advantage/disadvantage.

           Award a maximum of [4] in total.

     (b)   Explain different distribution channels that SVT could use for the WF15 water
           purifier (lines 132–133).                                                                    [6]

           Distribution channels include:
           • SVT could make use of agents in different countries. They have no experience of
              operating in LEDCs and may benefit from using experts in distribution in those
              countries (lines 132–133).
           • The lack of use of traditional promotion approaches may have an impact on how the
              product is distributed. SVT may need very direct approaches to communicate effectively
              with the potential customer.
           • SVT could try a traditional approach to selling the WF15 by using wholesalers and
              retailers. Much will depend on exactly where the product will be sold.
           • SVT could sell them through charities and/or NGO, and/or those employees who are
              taking part in the Outreach Programme.
           • SVT could sell using aspects of e-commerce/online selling making use of social media.


           Accept any other relevant distribution channel and explanation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer

           Award a maximum of [4] for limiting the explanation to only one distribution
           channel.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

           Award a maximum of [6] for a developed answer in context.

3.   (a)   Outline two non-financial rewards that SVT could have used for the long-serving employees
           that wanted to leave the company because of the implementation of the flexible-working
           contract (lines 56–64).                                                                 [4]

           Non-financial rewards include:
           • Job enrichment
           • Job rotation
           • Job enlargement
           • Empowerment
           • Teamwork
           • Purpose/the opportunity to make a difference
           Accept any reasonable answer.
           In the case of SVT, they offered a one-time incentive payment to those who agreed to the
           new contract—a financial reward.
           The non-financial rewards listed above could have been considered as alternative
           approaches, e.g., greater consultation around additional responsibilities / changes to job
           roles / enhanced use of group or team working etc.

           Mark as 2 + 2.


           Award [1] for each appropriate non-financial reward identified and an additional [1]
           for a description of how it impacts on SVT.

           Award a maximum of [2] per reward.

           Award a maximum of [4] in total.

(b)   With reference to STEEPLE factors, explain changes in the external environment
      that may have affected SVT (lines 20–21).                                                [6]


      External environment can relate to aspects of Social; Economic; Technical; Political;
      Environmental; Legal; and Ethical factors (STEEPLE)
      • Social—potable water is now seen as a need, especially in LEDCs; short supply of
        high skilled and specialized employees in the UK (lines 68–69).
      • Economic—recession; consumer confidence; interest rates etc., all impact on SVT.
        Demand for wind turbines is expected to grow (line 80); market for desalination is
        growing rapidly (line 39).
      • Technical—innovations in engineering require SVT to seek out new methods of
        production and to enhance product development.
      • Political—political instability has led to many issues in poorer countries increasing the
        demand for SVT’s products.
      • Environmental—climate change has led to greater need for demand of potable water
        in many countries around the world.
      • Legal—safety regulations may have forced SVT to develop more effective and safer
        products.
      • Ethical—Stakeholders have a strong CSR approach leading to the development of the
         Outreach Programme.
      N.B. Only one answer can be accepted in each of the STEEPLE categories e.g only one
      economic factor can count.

      Accept any other relevant external environment factor and explanation.
      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer

      Award a maximum of [4] for limiting the explanation to only one external factor.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

      Award a maximum of [6] for a developed answer in context.
                                                  –9–                  M23/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


                                               Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term quota sampling.                                                          [2]

           Quota sampling: gathers data from a group or sub-group with a specified number
           (target) of participants (respondents) in each group or sub-group. Groups/sub-
           groups will have specific traits/characteristics.

           Quota sampling involves segmenting a given population into a number of
           groups that share certain characteristics (mutually exclusive sub-groups) such
           as age and gender. Targets are then set for the number of people who must be
           selected in each segment.

           One starts by dividing the population into mutually exclusive groups or sub-groups
           (called strata) and sample units are selected, until the quotas (targets) are reached.

           N.B. no application required.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to
           the answer above.

     (b)   (i)  Calculate SVT’s home water filter market share in 2022 (show all your
           working).                                                                                      [2]

           World market in 2022 = $14bn
           SVT’s total revenue = $4.9 bn
           SVT’s market share = (SVT’s total revenue / World market in 2022) x 100 = ($4.9
           bn/14bn) x 100 = 35%

           Award [2] for working and a correct answer which must include the percentage
           sign (%) either in the final answer, or in the working.

           Award [1] for some correct working but with an arithmetic error.

           Do not reward formula only.

           (ii) Calculate the number of home water filters SVT sold in 2022 to the rest of
           the world (excluding Europe and the USA) (show all your working).             [2]

           SVT’s sales are $4.9bn
           SVT’s sales to Europe and the USA = 90% of SVT’s total sales
           SVT’s sales to the rest of world = $0.49bn (10% of total sales)
           Average revenue earned per water filter = $20
           So, $0.49bn/$20 = 24.5m water filters

           Alternative answer:
           $490 000 000 / $20 = 24 500 000 water filters

           Award [2] for working and a correct answer with the correct unit (“water filters” or
           “units” or “pieces” or “products”) either in the final answer, or in the working.
           Award [1] for some correct working (especially the 10% of total sales for “rest of
           the world”) but with an arithmetic error.

(c)   Explain two factors that SVT would have needed to consider when deciding
      where to open the new factory in Asia.                                               [4]

      Possible factors include:

      • how do rents and cost of land compare between existing factories and Asia?
      • how do energy costs compare (again high in US/Europe);
      • what management issues are there, possibly with different cultures?;
      • what would happen to existing employees?;
      • main markets are outside Asia (90% of sales are in Europe and USA), so
        possible logistical issues (infrastructure, transport): distance from suppliers
        and customers so is this a sustainable model?;
      • availability of sufficient skilled labour in Asia?;
      • legal (law, tax) issues especially about pollution and the environment;
      • support (or not) from the government (and the community) of the country where
        the new factory is located.


      Accept any other relevant factor.

      Candidates may use different parts of the course to answer this question, for
      example with external factors from a STEEPLE analysis, or considering the
      “business functions” (finance: costs; human resources: available workforce;
      operations: logistics etc.). All these approaches are fine. The question is about
      “opening a new factory in Asia”, not about selling and commercializing in Asia, so
      factors such as local demand, local competition and advertising are not relevant.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for each relevant factor in context and an additional of [1] for an
      explanation linking that factor to SVT. Maximum 2 factors.
                                             – 11 –            M23/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M




(d)   Discuss whether SVT should have increased the price of its home water filters.     [10]

      Possible arguments in favour:

      • enabled them to launch advertising campaign which would potentially benefit
        millions;
      • enabled some filters to be provided free to charities in LEDCs;
      • fits in with SVT’s CSR ideas;
      • good for SVT’s reputation;
      • 80% of SVT’s customers in Europe and the USA have above-average incomes
        and can afford the price increase from $20 to $21.
      Possible arguments against:

      •   many customers may not be able to afford the increased price;
      •   sales might fall;
      •   say lead to lower profits;
      •   some directors disagree.


      Accept any other relevant arguments.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 6 with further
      guidance below.

      Theoretical answer or context limited to naming the business or lack of
      development max [4].

      Discussion of only one option marks limited to [5].

      Discussion but no clear balance [6].

      Options considered, good use of evidence, particularly from section B, but no
      effective conclusion award a maximum of [8].

      For [10] the answer needs to be clearly relevant to SVT with good use of context
      and a clear sense of whether or not SVT should have increased its prices.
