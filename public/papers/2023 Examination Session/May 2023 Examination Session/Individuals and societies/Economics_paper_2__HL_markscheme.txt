Notes for examiners:
1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the maximum
marks as indicated.
2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts,
then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR
on the script where you are rewarding this.
3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to
2 decimal places or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate
may only be penalized ONCE for each type of error across all subparts of (b) questions.

       axis may be Quantity, Q, Q of labour or labour or number of workers,
       employment. All abbreviations are acceptable.

       The unemployment/excess supply of labour/surplus can be illustrated by
       referring to Q1Q2, NsNd, QsQd, or by annotating the diagram (for example
       showing the surplus). A title is not necessary.

       appropriately, it can be fully rewarded.

(e)   Using a J-curve diagram, explain the likely reason why the change in the
      exchange rate for the peso initially caused the deficit on the balance of trade to
      widen and then eventually led to a surplus (Text A, paragraph 5).                         [4]

              curve declining and then rising
              OR
              an explanation that in the short run, the sum of PEDs for exports
              and imports was less than one / inelastic (or the Marshall-Lerner
              condition was not fulfilled) so the deficit widens [1] but in the
              long run the M-L condition is met so it leads to a surplus [1].
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.          3–4
              For a correct J curve diagram with appropriate labelling, with the
              curve declining and then rising
              AND
              an explanation that in the short run, the sum of PEDs for exports
              and imports was less than one / inelastic (or the Marshall-Lerner
              condition was not fulfilled) so the deficit widens [1] but in the
              long run the M-L condition is met so it leads to a surplus [1].

      NB An alternative correct explanation could be that, in the short run, contracts cannot
      be rewritten (or similar) and therefore the volumes of exports and imports do not
      adjust completely to the new prices leading to increased deficit [1], but in the long
      run, the consumers adjust more, leading to an improvement/surplus in the balance of
      trade [1].

              OR

              means that there will be more investment/spending on

Answers may include:
• a definition of a free trade agreement/area
• a tariff diagram
• an AD/AS diagram
• a PPC diagram
• a diagram showing comparative advantage for two different goods
• a diagram showing a subsidy for US corn producers.

Possible costs of participation in an FTA:
• trade diversion (Text B, paragraph 1 or 4)
• inequality between the manufacturing north (urban areas) and the agricultural
  south (rural areas) probably widening (Text B, paragraph 2; Text C)
• some sectors cannot compete with (subsidized) imports leading to job losses (Text
  B, paragraphs 2 or 3)
• US/Canadian companies setting up factories in Mexico may lead to exploitation of
  workers and/or the environment (Text B, paragraph 2 or 3)
• profits from the factories will be sent back to the US/Canada leading to an outflow
  on the current account, which is already in deficit (Text A paragraph 5; Text B,
  paragraph 2 or 3; Table 1)
• rules will prevent Mexico from getting the cheapest inputs (Text B, paragraph 4)
• informal sector unlikely to gain from free trade (Text C, paragraph 1).

Possible benefits of participation in an FTA:
• trade creation, which may improve the growth rate of GDP (Text A, paragraph 1;
  Text B, paragraph 1 or 3; Table 1)
• lower tariffs on imports and stimulus to efficiency lead to higher productivity and
  lower prices (Text B, paragraph 2)
• Mexico can gain a surplus on the Balance of Trade (Text A, paragraph 5; Table 1)
• more inward FDI (Text B, paragraph 2; Table 1)
• higher wages (above the minimum wages) for those working in manufacturing
  firms that export to US/Canada (Text B, paragraph 4)
• changes in HDI and Gini coefficient indicate an improvement in the standard of
  living and less inequality, which may be due to the FTA (Table 2)
• rules to protect the environment leading to more sustainable growth and
  development (Text B, paragraph 1 or 4)
• Mexico is able to increase exports of goods other than oil to reduce dependence
  on oil (diversification is enabled) (Text A, paragraph 3).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
appropriate, should be rewarded.

       Command term

Answers may include:
• definition of growth
• definition of consumption
• definition of production
• definition of responsible/sustainable
• an externalities diagram
• a PPC diagram
• an AD/AS diagram.

Ways in which Indonesia is not meeting the SDG because of growth (ie there is a
conflict):
• negative production externalities of palm oil production (Text E, paragraph 1 or 2)
• negative consumption externalities of using palm oil based diesel (Text D,
  paragraph 3 or 5)
• planning production/government expenditure is difficult, because exporting a
  commodity with low PED and PES leads to volatile prices and uncertainty (Text D,
  paragraph 4)
• exports may not be sustained if importing countries become more concerned about
  environmental damage (Text D, paragraph 5)
• small-scale farmers use resources inefficiently/unsustainably (Text F)
• small-scale farmers’ lack of property rights leads to disputes and uncertainty (Text
  F, paragraph 1)
• inequality has not been lessened and has increased (Table 3)
• deforestation still occurring, even if reducing
• illegal clearing of land due to lack of property rights
• still poor production techniques in small scale farming-only very recently extended
  ISPO certification scheme
• demand still rising for palm oil in many product areas.

Ways in which Indonesia is meeting the SDG while achieving growth (i.e. there is
not a conflict):
• manufacturing palm oil based diesel, which will be better for the environment (Text
   D, paragraph 3)
• palm oil production provides jobs and has probably contributed to the sustained
   growth and the lower absolute poverty levels (Text D, paragraph 1; Table 4)
• palm oil production provides export revenue which will be useful for buying capital
   imports etc for production of secondary goods, rather than relying on primary
   exports (Text D, paragraph 2; Table 3)
• the tax revenue provides the government with funds, which it can use to improve
   development and which will help with reducing the widening budget deficit (Text D,
   paragraph 4, Table 3)
• MNCs’ pressure to stop deforestation is successfully exerting pressure on Indonesia
   (Text E, paragraph 4)
• the establishment of property rights will help both objectives (Text F, paragraph 1)
• Indonesia is extending the IPSO certification system to small-scale farmers, which
   may encourage both a more sustainable use of resources and economic growth
   (Text F, paragraph 2).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
appropriate, should be rewarded.
