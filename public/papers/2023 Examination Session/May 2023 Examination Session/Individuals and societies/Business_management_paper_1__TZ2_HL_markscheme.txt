                                              Section A
1.   (a)   Outline possible different interests of two external stakeholders arising from SVT’s Outreach
           Programme (lines 96–115)                                                           [4]


           External stakeholders could include: Government, suppliers, customers and
           consumers, local community, financiers, pressure groups, the media, NGOs,
           charities.

           In this instance:

           • People in less economically developed countries (LEDCs) would receive free
              skilled labour;
           • NGOs would get support and cooperation;
           • customers might benefit from new products that might arise from the
              programme eg WF15;
           • possible suppliers for future distribution channels;
           • the media might view SVT in a better light – important because of adverse
              publicity;
           • lower profits might impact on potential investors;
           • local people/communities: would receive training;
           • school education, infrastructure would be repaired.

           N.B. shareholders and the winner of the competition are not considered as external
           stakeholders.

           Accept other relevant stakeholder and interests in context.

           Mark as [2] + [2].


           Award [1] for each correct external stakeholder identified and [1] for a description of
           how that stakeholder’s interests are affected by the outreach programme. Award a
           maximum of [2] per stakeholder.
                                             –8–                M23/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


(b)   Explain the factors that SVT should consider when deciding on a marketing
      strategy for the WF15 water purifier (lines 116-138).                              [6]

      Factors include:
      • market research carried out;
      • marketing budget available;
      • aspects of the 4 P’s.

      Product:
      • winning design;
      • produces sufficient potable water;
      • meets WHO standards.

      Place
      • not yet decided;
      • would need to be able to deliver to remote places;
      • use of agencies overseas?;
      • no existing distribution channel;
      • little experience of distributing consumer products in LEDCs.

      Price
      •  under discussion but one proposal is not-for-profit;
      •  pricing strategy not yet agreed;
      •  impact on other products?;
      •  can SVT afford this?;
      •  subsidize product? Affordable for families versus unhappy stakeholders?.

      Promotion
      • choice of media is important, few newspapers read, few televisions owned;
      • however large and growing use of social media;
      • can use the CSR aspect in general promotion for the business.

      Candidates are not required to follow a 4P’s approach and may use different parts of the
      course to answer this question. Finance, staffing etc. could be valid factors to consider.

      Accept any other relevant factor and explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] if the explanation is limited to one factor.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

2.   (a)   Outline two possible economies of scale that are likely to have been achieved
           through the takeover of H4 (lines 49–81).                                           [4]

           Possible economies of scale include:

           Technical: Does the businesses have better technology? Would it be cheaper to
           install technology across a range of businesses?

           Managerial: Perhaps it reduced the number of managers needed. Managers
           specialize in one job. They can work with greater efficiency;

           Financial: The businesses taken over were small so maybe not much power in
           financial markets, but the combined size might be significant. Bigger
           businesses are less risky than smaller businesses. Banks will charge lower rates
           of interest on loans and overdrafts;

           Marketing: We don’t know much about how the products are promoted. We do
           know there’s a significant marketing budget which needs to be spread over a
           wider range of products. They can direct more effective marketing campaigns.

           Purchasing: Do the various firms share similar raw materials? Bulk buying;

           Risk bearing: Fewer competitors, lower risk? They spread the risk of one
           product failing.

           Mark as [2] + [2].


           Award [1] for each economy of scale identified and [1] for an outline of how that
           economy of scale relates to SVT PLC. Award a maximum of [2] per economy of
           scale.

(b)   Explain the advantages of organizing SVT into divisions based on product
      (lines 10–14).                                                                     [6]

      Possible advantages include:

      • decisions can be made quicker eg Yannick’s quick response to a crisis;
      • leadership style can be chosen to suit needs eg Ariadne versus Yannick;
      • each division will have its own areas of expertise and it will be easier to
        ensure these skills are focused where needed eg Consumer Products will
        probably need people able to undertake consumer market research and have
        marketing and sales experts;
      • customers will know where in the organization to seek help and advice eg
        potential customers seeking desalination equipment will have immediate links
        with the Desalination Division;
      • it may be easier to focus finance and other support to areas where it is
        most needed eg if a new major project is to be undertaken, the Engineering
        Division might be the key focus.

      Accept any other relevant advantage and explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] for an answer that limits explanation to one advantage.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

3.   (a)   Outline two steps in the recruitment process for the 300 new employees needed for the
           former H4 factories (lines 65–72).                                                      [4]

           Steps include:

           Identification: of job role:
           • doing a job audit;
           • preparing job description;
           • person specification.

           Attracting applicants

           Applications:
           • job advertisement;
           • application forms designed, circulated, received;
           • recruitment by business or agency?

           Selection:
           • shortlisting;
           • testing;
           • interviewing.

           Candidates can be rewarded for identifying any of the main headings or the sub-
           headings. These ideas can be contextualized by reference to the facts that:
           • 300 vacancies to fill is a large number;
           • the vacancies are for highly skilled people;
           • there are a few such highly skilled people available;
           • range of skills needed, so recruitment may have to be spread over a variety
             of methods;
           • the HR department should choose carefully where to advertise the
             vacancies;
           • teamwork necessary: may require testing;
           • there may not have been sufficient suitable applicants in UK alone;
           • recruitment methods to be decided (interviews, tasks, tests, etc.): what
             cost? What might be best method for selecting?

           N.B. Do not accept any form of training including induction.

           Mark as [2] + [2].


           Award [1] for each correct step identified and [1] for a description of how that
           step relates to SVT. Award a maximum of [2] per step.

      the small water filter manufacturers in Europe and the United States of America
      (USA) (lines 91–92).                                                               [6]


      SVT is a public limited company so a range of sources could include:

      • Loans/mortgages/bonds/debentures etc. business is profitable, works well,
        banks and other investors may want to lend with favourable conditions
        (interest rates, terms, favourable conditions for collateral etc.);
      • share issue: conditions are good for a share issue: PLC, good reputation,
        sound profits successful business;
      • profits: are there any retained profits not yet spent? Sufficient for such a
        development?
      • Joint ventures/venture capital: no real evidence that these are needed.
        Would they want it?

      Accept any other relevant source of finance and explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] for an answer that limits explanation to one source of
      finance.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
      Eg if most of the context is mentioned but not developed.

                                                Section B


4.   (a)     Define the term profit centre.                                                        [2]

             A section of a business where both costs and revenues can be identified and
             are recorded.

             N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

             Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

             To gain both marks, answers must make refence to costs and revenues as well
             as some aspect or section of the business. The “section” is likely to refer to a
             department, a product, a process, a division etc.
             Be careful not to reward a “place” or an “area” unless this is clarified.

             Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
             understanding.

             Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar
             to the answer above.

     (b)     (i)    Using the reducing/declining balance method of depreciation, calculate the
             total depreciation of the automated monitoring equipment after a period of two
             years (show all your working).                                                        [2]

             Equipment cost $100m
             Value at end first year = 0.8 x 100m =$80m
             Value at end second year = 0.8 x $80m = $64m award [1]
             Amount of depreciation = $100m – $64m = $36m award [2]

             Alternative answer:

                  Year                     Depreciation                       Net book value
                   0                            $0                            $100 000 000
                   1             $20 000 000 ($100 000 000 x 20%)              $80 000 000
                   2             $16 000 000 ($80 000 000 x 20%)               $64 000 000
           Total depreciation              $36 000 000


             Award [2] for correct answer, with working and correct units.

             Award [1] for a reasonable attempt or absence of working and/or correct units.

             Award [1] for the calculation of $64m for net book value.

             Award [1] for an attempt, or for a correct answer that does not include the correct
             sign ($).
             Where there is no $ sign in the final answer give benefit of the doubt (BOD) if the
             $ sign is used in the working.

             Do not reward formula only.

(ii)   With reference to SVT’s automated monitoring equipment, explain one
       advantage of using the reducing/declining balance method of depreciation.   [2]

       • This is a complex piece of technical equipment (automated
         monitoring equipment); very unlikely to deteriorate equally over time.
         Even more unlikely to have a useful life of ten years due to rapidly
         changing technology so will get close to its residual value early on.
       • It matches the cost and revenue of the business, because the higher
         amount of depreciation provided in the early years is matched against
         the larger amount of revenue generated by the increased production
         brought about by the use of the new asset;
       • it provides a more accurate measure of the depreciation compared
         to the straight-line method;
       • it lowers the income tax expense in the early years.
        Accept any other relevant advantage.

        Award [1] for an appropriate advantage and an additional [1] for an
        explanation of how that advantage relates to SVT.

        [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation and / or
        application.
        There must be some reference to SVT’ equipment as well as the
        advantage of using this method of depreciation.

        For example:

        For an identification or a description of an advantage with or without
        application [1].

        For explanation of an advantage with no application [1].

        For explanation of an advantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain two ways in which effective contingency planning at SVT could have
      prevented the problems experienced in Dalgera.                      [4]

      Contingency planning involves:

      •   identifying potential disasters;
      •   assessing the likelihood of these disasters occurring;
      •   reducing the potential impact of the crises;
      •   planning for the continuous operations of the business;
      •   developing a post-disaster recovery plan.
      Solutions:

      •   improve the process of considering possible disasters;
      •   develop an action plan for each of these possible scenarios;
      •   set up improved and automatic reporting/investigation procedures;
      •   monitor, review, update levels of equipment and other resources;
      •   introduce training for dealing with crises;
      •   develop plans for how to return to normal working.
      To award [4] there must be some clear understanding of contingency planning in
      context.

      Award [3] if the answer shows two ways that SVT could have prevented the
      problems without specifically explaining contingency planning.

      Accept any other relevant ways.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for an appropriate way and an additional [1] for an explanation of how
      that way relates to SVT. Award a maximum of [2] for each way.

      [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation and / or
      application.

      For example:

      For an identification or a description of a way with or without application [1].

      For explanation of a way with no application [1].

      For explanation of a way and application [2].

(d)   With reference to SVT, evaluate the opportunities and threats posed by entering
      international markets.                                                               [10]

      Opportunities could include:

      • potential for greater brand image especially in LEDCs;
      • far greater markets to tap e.g. Asia;
      • economies of scale;
      • Asia has greater growth potential;
      • possibility of new locations for manufacturing;
      • diversification: an opportunity to spread risks by investing in other countries;
      • enhanced brand image: SVT can be perceived to be more successful than
        those that operate in the domestic market (brand prestige and loyalty);
      • forming new business relationships.
      Threats could include:

      • when things go wrong, there are repercussions worldwide;
      • problems partly caused by lower standards in Dalgera;
      • more difficult to manage;
      • social issues – problems would not have got out of hand in, for example, US,
        Europe where monitoring by television and society far greater;
      • political challenges;
      • law challenges: different countries = different laws;
      • fluctuating and different exchange rates and interest rates.
      Evaluation could relate to an assessment of the importance of the threats and
      opportunities and the specific impact on SVT. This could be related to specific
      threats and whether they might have an immediate or longer-term impact.

      Accept any other relevant evaluation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4 with further
      guidance below.

      Theoretical answer or context limited to naming the business or lack of
      development award a maximum of [4].

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is only on opportunities or threats.

      Award a maximum of [6] if the explanation only has one threat plus opportunities
      or one opportunity plus threats.

      Award a maximum of [8] if the response is balanced but lacks clear evaluation.

                                          Section C
5.   Using the case study and additional information on pages 3 and 4, recommend whether SVT
                                                                                               [20]
     should choose Option 1 or Option 2.
     Option 1
     Arguments for:

     •   maintains independence;
     •   relatively small investment?
     •   existing field of expertise;
     •   how does investment of $120 million relate to return of $0.5 million per turbine?

     Arguments against:

     • rather early and rapid expansion;
     • after providing the 30 turbines for the new desalination plant, will SVT find new
       customers to maintain the upgraded capacity? Will they be able to continue selling
       that quantity of turbines per year?
     • the new break-even seems to be very high (40 units). It is 66.66% of the total
       capacity;

     Option 2

     Arguments for:

     •   guarantees availability of new turbines;
     •   further possible collaboration;
     •   does ZAZ have new expertise?
     •   construction costs and risks will be shared.

     Arguments against:

     •   adverse publicity;
     •   loss of independence;
     •   must share operation fees;
     •   may depend on negotiated price for final five years of the project.

     Other factors:

     • What if they fail to complete the project on time and suffer the delay penalties?
     • 30% probability of paying $40 million and 10% chance of $80 million.
     • The investment is huge in both cases—do they want to do either? [assessment of
       risk].
     • Are there other financial considerations?
     • The need to finance any aspect of this investment?
     • How good is their forecasting of the data?
     • Some of the predictions are 15 + years away.
     • Are there external factors (change in the market; technology; etc.) that could change
       during the life of the project?

     Accept any other relevant recommendation.

N.B. if a candidate responds to this question without any reference to the
additional stimulus material (the additional material that comes with question 5 in
the examination paper), the maximum mark that the candidate can receive under
criteria A, B, C, and E (all the criteria except structure) is [2] per criterion. Award
a maximum of [12] overall.

Marks should be allocated according to the assessment criteria on pages 5-6 with
further guidance below.

Criterion A: possible theories, management tools and techniques include:
Accounting techniques and ratios, interpreting data, Decision Tree, Ansoff, Force
Field Analysis (FFA), importance of assumptions, also, possibly, fishbone, Boston
Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, marketing issues (market research, 4Ps),
HRM/management issues (leadership, motivation), SWOT (if used with a sense
of purpose).

For [4]: Tools, techniques and theory understood and developed well with some
relevance to the additional stimulus material.

For [2]: some understanding of at least two tools, techniques or theories, but not
developed.


Criterion B: the tools, techniques, theories and stimulus applied to the
decision. Application will be judged by the use of the stimulus material.

Remember, understanding has been rewarded in Criterion A. So B is about USE.

For [4]: relevant tools, techniques and theories are applied well to the case study
context and additional stimulus material, the application is convincing and
relevant.

For [2]: some limited context/application but not developed. Use of tools limits
candidate’s ability to make reasoned arguments.

Criterion C: options discussed in balanced way, conclusions drawn and
recommendation made/supported.

For [4]: there needs to be a clear recommendation supported by the data.

For [2]: some limited arguments but not justified. Or limited analysis (eg one-
sided argument) but candidate arrives/draws a reasoned conclusion.

Criterion D: Structure: this criterion assesses the extent to which the candidate
organizes his or her ideas with clarity, and presents a structured piece of writing
comprised of:

• an introduction
• a concluding paragraph. Please note this can be different from the concept of
a conclusion/recommendation in Criterion C. D can be rewarded without a
recommendation.
• fit-for-purpose paragraphs. This means: not too long, each focused on distinct
issues;
• logical structure. This means whether there is a clear flow to guide the reader
through the discussion, how the paragraphs are sequenced.

For [4]: all four elements present, clearly organized.

For [2]: no logical structure but other elements present or logical structure with
other elements missing.


Criterion E: Stakeholders:
• individuals: SVT directors, production director;
• groups: foreign government, the board of directors, competitors, ZAZ.

For [4]: individual(s) and group(s) are considered in a balanced way. i.e needs one
or more of both individuals and groups developed.

For [2]: one individual or one group considered appropriately, or several individuals
and/or groups considered superficially.

Award [0] if no stakeholders are considered.
