Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

1.     (a)   Explain why, in the case of healthcare and education, positive externalities might
             cause market failure.                                                                    [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: positive externalities, market failure.
             • Explanation: of healthcare and education as merit goods which generate
               external benefits, as well as private benefits, and whose consumption is
               therefore likely to be less than the socially optimal level if left to the free
               market to provide; explanation of positive externalities in the case of
               healthcare, eg control the spread of contagious diseases and healthy workers
               being more productive; and an explanation of the positive externalities in the
               case of education, eg the positive relationship between education,
               productivity, employment, innovation and economic growth.
             • Diagram: positive externalities of consumption diagram showing MSB above
               MPB, MSB not equalling MSC and welfare loss.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one of healthcare or education is explained
             and developed.

        revenues and the ability of governments to increase their spending on
        education, health care and infrastructure; GNI per capita at PPP as part of
        the HDI.
      • Diagram: use of a PPC diagram to show the difference between growth and
        development and/or the use of an AD/AS diagram to show economic growth.
      • Synthesis (discuss): a challenge to the view in terms of the fact that
        development is multi-dimensional and an increase in GDP/GNI might have no
        impact on several indicators of development such as health and education,
        economic, social and gender inequality, energy, quality of the environment;
        consideration of “always”.

        and development and/or countries that have experienced growth

   7–9     • The response indicates understanding of the specific demands of the question,
