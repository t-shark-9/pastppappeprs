Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to
include a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is
no “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

1.   (a)   Identify two components in an RFID tag.                                                  [2]

           Answers may include:
           • microchip (or IC)
           • an antenna
           • a substrate or protective material layer that holds all the components together
           • attachment system - adhesive to enable fixing to solid object or tamper proof
             case with magnetic pin release for garment RFID tags or stitched into fabric in
             garment
           • if active, a power source e.g., battery otherwise an induction coil
           • receiver / transmitter / a transceiver, a device that both transmits and receives
             communication
           • memory (do not accept storage).

           Award [1] for each component in a RFID tag up to [2].

           Note: Accept shortened descriptions of the components e.g., chip, microprocessor, coil


     (b)   Identify two characteristics of a smart shelf.                                           [2]

           Answers may include:
           • Smart shelf displays can be wirelessly updated with current stock data
             including availability, prices etc.
           • Smart shelves provide real-time updates of stock levels.
           • Uses RFID antenna/readers on the shelves to read information about products
             from their RFID tags
           • Thresholds for low stock levels can be set and notifications generated when
             thresholds are met/reached.
           • Smart shelf display systems can recognise RFID and display item information.
           • Smart shelf displays are a low power, high energy efficient LCD screen.
           • Often battery powered reducing need for expensive infrastructure.
           • Identify if stock positioning is incorrect/detect misplaced items i.e. items that
             have been wrongly put back on a shelf.
           • uses weight sensors to calculate the quantity of inventory that exists on a
             shelf.

           Award [1] for each characteristic of a smart shelf up to [2].

           Notes:
           The characteristic should be in the form of a sentence and not the component listed,
           nor the uses listed.
           The characteristic must be that of the smart shelf not the stock inventory system.

2.   The augmented reality (AR) solutions proposed by André include augmented reality
     mirrors and an in-store app (lines 37–42).

     Explain three factors that André should consider when installing these augmented
     reality (AR) technologies.                                                                       [6]

     Note: Interpretation of installing the mirror could be at the time of physical installation in
     the store, or the decision to have the AR mirrors in the store. Both are accepted.

     Answers may include:
     Factors to consider when physically installing the mirrors in the store:
     • Location of Mirrors.
     • The need for privacy which may be greater in some cultures than others (and positioning should
       allow for customers of all sizes to be able to see themselves fully in the mirror).

     • Software updates for the Mirrors.
     • How the mirrors will be updated with new product lines.

     • Mirror Configuration.
     • The mirror should be configured to show an accurate representation of the item and
       not be distorted, so it misleads customers.

     • Security of data.
     • How secure are the images that are captured when using the mirror.

     • Testing.
     • Testing the AR technologies to make sure that there are no bugs or issues so that
       the customers’ experience is optimal.

     • Training.
     • Planning for training on how the mirrors will be maintained and/or configured by
       staff.

     • Data Protection Policies.
     • When introducing the new technologies, policies mayshould include - how data is to
       be collected, used, stored and/or shared.
                                             –6–                  M23/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Factors to consider when deciding to include AR Mirrors in the store:
• Size of mirrors.
• For example, how can it be adjusted to deal with variations in height between
  different customers.

• Cost/Quantity of Mirrors.
• Consider how many to buy in order for their use to be effective.

• Phone compatibility.
• Whether or not customers phones have the appropriate features and specifications
  to run the AR technology in the app.

• Ease of Use/Digital Divide.
• how easy are the mirrors/AR App to use and what help is given to use them e.g.
  tutorials, help guides; are there groups of customers who would not have the skills
  to use AR?

• App/Mirror Recommendations of clothing choices may be unsuitable.
• For example, may overlay with inappropriate clothing selection such as sleeveless,
  skirt/dress length, perceived immodesty, insensitivity to gender/non-binary,
  insensitivity to age, insensitivity to body dimensions/shape.

• Recognition of skin colour/tone if using a virtual model.
• Computer enhancements/modification to body shape of the customer (snap chat
  lens style)/the skin tone could be related to cultural differences.

• Language options for companion app/mirror voice and/or labels.
• Allows users to interact with mirror/app in their own language or a range of
  languages.

• Options for customer to provide cultural preferences in app/on mirror.
• For example, may resolve suggestions of clothing choices.

Award [1] for each factor that needs to be considered in the deployment of the virtual
mirrors and [1] for each development up to [2].

Note: Accept other relevant factors which would be useful at the point of installation or
when deciding to include an AR solution in the store.

Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

3.   The customer service robots have been developed to recognize the human voice using
     natural language processing (lines 43–44).

     To what extent will customer service robots using natural language processing improve
     the customer experience in MCA Sports’ flagship store?                                             [8]


     Answers may include:
     Improves customer experience:
     • Better data analysis: large amounts of text-based information can be processed.
       and analyzed leading to improved interaction with customer.
     • Streamlined processes by answering questions quickly for customers.
     • Improved customer experience - do not have to wait to talk to staff member.
     • No need for breaks/can communicate in a variety of languages.
     • Consistency with responses.
     • Language comprehension continually develops.


     Does not improve customer experience:
     • Muffled speech due to masks and visor wearing.
     • Accessibility for the auditory or vocally challenged, non-verbal people.
     • Unable to recognize rarely heard accents/non-standard dialects, e.g. customer
       service robots may be calibrated for one particular dialect such as English spoken
       in England.
     • Interpreting colloquialisms, slang, sarcasm, irony, informal phrases, expressions,
       homonyms and synonyms.
     • Languages where not much data has been collected, especially those spoken by
       people with less access to technology.
     • Domain-specific language – may be a lack of understanding of contextual words or
       niche language/vocabulary used in retail industry.

     Notes:
     The question focuses on whether the customer experience is improved by the use of robots that
     use natural language processing.

     [3 – 4]: response may include implicit references to the customer experience and be unbalanced.

     [5 – 6]: response should include explicit reference to the customer experience with a balance of
     arguments, conclusion may not be well developed, some references to the MCA store are
     expected.

     [7 - 8]: responses should include evaluative comments that make explicit references to the Case
     Study and demonstrates a knowledge of natural language processing.

     Please see the markband on page 8.

4.   The Geneva store will become MCA Sports’ flagship store and will incorporate four new
     technologies (lines 31–36):
      • Augmented reality (AR) solutions
      • An in-store companion app
      • Customer service robots
      • Smart shelves.

     Discuss whether the introduction of these new technologies will be beneficial to MCA
     Sports.                                                                                      [12]

     Answers may include:
     Beneficial to the MCA Sports
     • Establish position as market leader in the development and implementation of new
       technologies.
     • Bring in additional customers who are tech savvy/pioneers.
     • Increase in customers due to the increased language options and consideration of
       cultures
     • Gain more accurate information about preferences of customers / create consumer
       profiles and be able to use this to make more informed choices regarding items to
       stock.
     • Real-time data collection regarding inquiries and searches.
     • Real-time stock management enabling more efficient use of the supply chain,
       restocking shelves etc which could lead to a JIT system being implemented / less
       storage required / reduces overheads.
     • Reduced time/cost returning garments to shelves - AR-mirrors.
     • Reduction in stock loss through theft, stock damage and soiling.
     • Increased efficiency in the use of customer service robots who can handle simple
       inquiries on stocking level, locations, garment availability etc.
     • Staff are involved in each stage of the upgrade leading to loyalty, increased
       motivation and retention rates
     • Staff are upskilled in the use of new technologies/staff from other stores can be
       trained in advance of upgrades

     Concerns for MCA Sports
     • Upfront costs to introduce the new technologies
     • There may not be interoperability between the different technologies
     • Need for staff training
     • Technical support for customers and staff
     • Requirements to secure customer data may require additional costs as the increase
       in data collected and possibility of it being aggregated may lead to more rigorous
       data security measures being needed.
     • Customers and staff may not embrace the new technologies so there may be
       additional costs. There may be concerns about customers’ perceptions that
       sensitive personal data may be shared.
     • Costs associated with the maintenance of new technologies
     • Consideration for non-technical customers and staff
     • Downtime/reliability issues – staff may not retain existing skills prior to upgrade as
       these have been replaced by new technologies
     • Short term - disruption to store while IT systems are installed/integrated with existing
       technologies potentially leading to loss of sales/customers
     • Consideration of legal implications/requirements associated with these new
       technologies
     • Workplace health and safety considerations
     • Potential objections from workplace unions that may need to be negotiated
                                            – 10 –               M23/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Concluding comments
• MCA may consider that although the technocentric strategy leads to short term
  costs, over the longer term it could position them as a market leader / gain first
  mover advantage.
• This could lead to other retailers adopting this strategy further strengthening MCA’s
  position.
• It could lead to these technologies being implemented in other MCA stores.

Notes:
This question focuses on the impact on the store, which is different from Question 3 which focuses
on the impact on customers.

The technologies will impact the customers, but to be in the competent markband and above,
candidates should then make explicit links to the store e.g., increase in sales, returning customers
due to in-store experience

Please see the markband on page 11.
