Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

 1. Evaluate the contribution of Mongol expansion in re-establishing trade along the Silk Road.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of Mongol expansion in
     re-establishing trade along the Silk Road, weighing up its importance or otherwise. Candidates may
     consider a range of political and economic factors. Candidates may refer to the expansion of the
     Mongol Empire from Asia into Europe, thereby creating a single political entity which contributed to
     the re-establishment of effective communication and trade. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
     for example the relative peace created by the Mongols (the Pax Mongolica), which encouraged
     expeditions along the Silk Road, as well as allowing for the construction and maintenance of
     infrastructure which helped to re-establish trade. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

 2. To what extent was the rise in seaborne trade the main reason for the decline of the Silk Road?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
     rise in seaborne trade was the main reason for the decline of the Silk Road. Reasons may predate
     the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     refer to the importance of the discovery of the sea route to the Far East by the Portuguese, which
     opened an alternative trade route to the Silk Road. Sea routes could transport larger amount of
     goods usually more quickly and more safely and were preferred by the European nations. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed, for example the collapse of the Mongol Empire and the
     subsequent increase in danger and uncertainty along the traditional land trade routes, but with a
     focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –5–                  M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3. Examine how the role of the samurai expanded under Minamoto.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the rule of Minamoto
     and the expanding role of the samurai. Candidates may mention factors that predate the timeframe
     or they may discuss consequences beyond, but these must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
     the question. Candidates may refer to political factors like the supplanting of the emperor’s provincial
     governors (kokushi) by Minamoto’s military appointees (shugo), meaning that the samurai class
     wielded power over areas previously run by the feudal aristocracy. Other relevant interrelationships
     may be considered, for example the expanding legal role of the shogun’s offices as the samurai
     helped to develop and enforce laws around the country, as well as the emergence of a distinctive
     and increasingly exclusive warrior ‘class’ around the palace of Kamakura, but with a focus on the
     issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.

 4. To what extent did samurai women have a significant role in Japanese society?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     samurai women played a significant role in Japanese society. Candidates may offer equal coverage
     of arguments for and against this suggestion, or they may prioritize their assessment of one or the
     other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the relative
     independence of samurai women, with their right to retain any possessions given to them during
     marriage offering them a degree of economic independence. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example the significant social influence samurai women could exert over their family’s
     position in society, particularly when acting on behalf of dead or absent husbands (even fulfilling their
     military obligations), but with a focus on the issue in the question. In contrast, candidates may refer
     to the fact that samurai women could still be used as objects to solidify alliances between elite
     families through marriage. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   Evaluate the significance of the voyage of Vasco da Gama (1498) and the capture of Malacca (1511)
     for South-East Asia.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of both the voyage of
     Vasco da Gama (1498) and the capture of Malacca (1511), weighing up the importance or otherwise
     of both events for South-East Asia. Consequence may extend beyond the timeframe but they must
     be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of Vasco
     da Gama’s voyage and the capture of Malacca, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one over
     the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
     impact of da Gama’s voyage on the region by encouraging Europeans to conduct expeditions to
     South-East Asia, bringing with them Western religion and technology. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example the conquest of Malacca opening South-East Asia to the ‘Columbian
     Exchange’, which fundamentally altered trade relations in the region, but with a focus on the issue
     in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

6.   Discuss the view that control of trade was the main reason for Chinese isolationism in the 17th
     century.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
     Chinese isolationism in the 17th century. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the continuing desire of
     the late Ming dynasty to control trade, encouraging them, for example, to restrict European access
     to Chinese markets. Candidates may also refer to the decline of the Ming dynasty in the early 17th
     century, forcing them to deal with serious internal problems like famine and invasion. Other relevant
     factors may be addressed, for example the resumption of the sea ban under the Qing dynasty,
     implemented in part to deal with threats posed to their newly won authority, the most significant of
     which was the Great Clearance implemented in response to the Taiwan-based regime of Koxinga,
     but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   “Good relations with the existing nobility was a key factor in consolidating Mughal rule.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
     good relations with the existing nobility was a key factor in consolidating Mughal rule. Reasons for
     the consolidation may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
     the question. Candidates may refer to Akbar the Great’s favourable treatment of the existing Muslim
     aristocracy, as well as his incorporation of the Hindu Rajput nobility into the regime by appointing
     them to various administrative and military positions, in exchange for allowing them to retain their
     traditional customs and rituals. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the forging of
     diplomatic relations with various states, as with the marriage of Akbar to a Rajput princess Mariam-
     uz-Zamani in 1562, and the series of successful military campaigns launched against regions like
     Kashmir and Sindh, which helped to cement Mughal power, but with a focus on the issue in the
     question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

8.   “The history of the Mughal Empire is one of religious cooperation, rather than conflict.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     history of the Mughal Empire is one of religious cooperation, rather than conflict. Candidates may
     offer equal coverage of religious cooperation and conflict, or they may prioritize their assessment of
     one over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer
     to the incorporation of members of the Hindu elite into the Mughal regime, a policy which continued,
     if not increased, as the dynasty continued. Candidates may also refer to the policy of inter-faith
     dialogue implemented under the reign of Akbar the Great, or the syncretic programme of ‘Divine
     Faith’ (Din-i Ilahi) introduced by the emperor. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
     the reimposition of the tax (jizya) on non-Muslims or the destruction of numerous Hindu temples,
     both during the reign of Aurungzeb, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Discuss the reasons for the introduction of the Ethical Policy (1901) in the Dutch East Indies.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the Ethical Policy (1901) was introduced in the Dutch East Indies. Candidates may refer to growing
      liberal opinion in the Netherlands for colonial reform in the Dutch East Indies. For example, Conrad
      Theodor van Deventer’s essay in De Gids argued that the Dutch colonial government had an ethical
      responsibly to return wealth to the indigenous population. In addition, supporters of reformist
      journalist Pieter Brooshooft gained an audience with Queen Wilhelmina, who would later announce
      the ‘Ethical Policy’. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the view that the policy
      was simply colonialism in a more favourable guise, with Dutch colonial authorities keen to change
      the appearance, if not the realty, of their rule, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

10.   Evaluate the effects of the Spanish colonial system in the Philippines.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Spanish colonial system in the
      Philippines, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of positive and negative elements, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one over the other.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the generally
      autocratic and exploitative nature of Spanish colonial rule, a regime dominated by insulares
      (Spaniards born in Spain). For example, the labour of many Filipinos was exploited on haciendas
      devoted to the production of coffee and sugar. This system also left native Filipinos without real
      political power, which led to increasing agitation on the part of revolutionary opponents of the colonial
      apparatus, agitation which culminated in the Philippine Revolution of 1896. Other relevant factors
      may be addressed, for example the introduction and spread of Catholicism amongst the population,
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   To what extent did the Government of India Act (1858) dramatically change the nature of British rule
      in India?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Government of India Act (1858) dramatically changed the nature of British rule in India.
      Consequences of the Act may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the transfer of power over India from the East
      India Company to the British Crown, and the theoretical change of status for the people of the
      subcontinent who became, according to Queen Victoria, like “all her other subjects”. In addition, the
      reversal of Dalhousie’s policy of political unification through annexation meant that princes were now
      given some autonomy if they swore allegiance to the Crown. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the new British policy of religious non-intervention within India, or the
      increasing centralisation of government under the Raj, with an associated expansion of the imperial
      bureaucracy, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

12.   Discuss the reasons for the loss of independence in Burma.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the
      loss of independence in Burma. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss a range of internal and external factors.
      Candidates may refer to British military superiority, particularly during the First Anglo-Burmese War,
      as well as the annexation of Lower Burma by the British in the aftermath of the second conflict
      between the powers. In addition, candidates may refer to the decimation of the traditional aristocracy
      during these wars, which fundamentally undermined Burma’s social structure, or the failure of King
      Mindon to modernise Burma’s government and economy in the face of further British encroachment.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example King Thibaw’s failure to gain constitutional
      recognition from Queen Victoria, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –               M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Evaluate the impact of the unequal treaties on China up to 1868.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the unequal treaties on
      China up to 1868, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Impacts may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to China’s requirement to cede territory to Western powers as a result of these treaties, including
      Hong Kong to the British in 1842, and the territory around Vladivostok to Russia after 1860. Qing
      authority was undermined by these treaties, which contributed to the outbreak of revolts, including
      the Taiping Rebellion. In addition, the legalisation of opium importation led to problems of addiction
      amongst many Chinese. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the granting of
      permission for missionaries to proselytise within China which led to a significant increase in the
      number of Christians in the country, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

14.   “There was significant social and economic change under the Tokugawa Shogunate prior to 1853.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      there was significant social and economic change under the Tokugawa Shogunate prior to 1853.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic changes, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to ultimately unsuccessful policies of the Tokugawa in insulating Japanese
      society from change. For example, despite its efforts in maintaining a strict feudal hierarchy,
      increasing wealth led to the development of a merchant class in the towns, which contributed to a
      modernising of the Japanese economy. Increasing wealth also led to a shift in social status, with
      urban dwellers gradually increasing their own influence at the expense of the traditional samurai
      class. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example a reaffirmation of the conservative
      nature of the Tokugawa Shogunate and its policy of isolation (sakoku), but with a focus on the issue
      in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Evaluate the impact of the gold rushes in Australia and New Zealand.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the gold rushes in Australia
      and New Zealand, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Impacts may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of Australia and New Zealand, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one country
      over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      influx of large numbers of migrants into both countries as a result of the rushes. The vast majority of
      these migrants were men, which created particular social conditions in these gold-bearing regions.
      As a result of this migration, however, particularly from countries like China, levels of xenophobia
      also increased. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the significant economic
      development for previously isolated regions, as well as the growth of cities like Melbourne and
      Dunedin, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

16.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War on either Australia or New Zealand.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the First World War on
      either Australia or New Zealand, weighing up its importance or otherwise. Impacts may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may refer to sense of nationhood that arguably developed for both nations on the shores of Gallipoli
      in 1915. In addition, while many sectors in both economies benefitted from the war, the post-war
      economic period saw rising unemployment and significant labour unrest; in the case of New Zealand,
      the Labour Party benefitted from this post-war slump. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example the immense number of casualties suffered and the disruptive effect this had on each
      society in the immediate post-war period, as well as programmes like the soldier settlement scheme
      in Australia which was designed to aid veterans upon their return from the war, but with a focus on
      the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17. Evaluate the effectiveness of the late Qing reforms (1901–1911).

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the late Qing reforms, weighing up their
     strengths and limitations. The evaluation may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly
     linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to military reforms, like the
     reorganisation and expansion of the New Army, which saw moderate success, as well as educational
     reforms which were not effective in the short term but arguably laid the foundation for the
     modernisation of China. Candidates may also evaluate the effectiveness of constitutional reforms,
     which were prolonged over the years but did not result in real change. Frustration at the
     ineffectiveness of some of these reforms contributed to the rise of revolutionary activity during this
     period, and would ultimately contribute to the fall of the Qing in 1912. Candidates may also refer to
     the effectiveness of cultural reforms such as the abolition of foot binding, as well as the lifting of the
     ban on marriage between Manchus and Han Chinese. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18. To what extent was the Meiji Restoration (1868) brought about by external factors?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the Meiji
     Restoration was brought about by external factors. Factors may predate the timeframe but they
     must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss a range of
     external factors. Candidates may refer to the arrival of the Americans and the subsequent signing of
     the Treaty of Kanagawa under duress to open up to the world, convincing the Japanese of the need
     to modernise. This also resulted in socioeconomic problems in Japan that necessitated
     change. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the challenges posed by the internal
     factional strife, as well as the decay of the feudal system but with a focus on the issue in the
     question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Examine the contribution of the immediate aftermath of the First World War to the rise of nationalism
      in India.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the immediate
      aftermath of the First World War and the rise of nationalism in India. Candidates may refer to how
      India’s contribution to the war effort led to economic hardship, leading to a rise in discontent against
      British colonial rule. Post-war, Indian nationalists looked to the British to fulfil their promises of greater
      local participation in administration. The increasing political awareness and activity of veteran
      soldiers was also crucial in India’s political awakening, particularly since the rationale for fighting
      alongside the Allies in the First World War was focused on the concepts of democracy and self-
      determination. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for example the implementation
      of the Rowlatt Act (1919), disappointment with the Government of India Act 1919, and anger at the
      Amritsar massacre in the same year, all of which contributed to the transformation of the nationalist
      movement into a mass movement. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   “The princely states posed a significant challenge to post-independence India.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      princely states posed a significant challenge to post-independence India. Candidates may refer to
      the various princely states that demanded independence in the aftermath of Partition. Candidates
      may also highlight the need for military intervention in order for some states to join the Indian Union.
      Specifically, candidates may refer to how the princely state of Kashmir posed a significant, long-term
      challenge to post-independence India, triggering the First Indo-Pakistani War and subsequent wars.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the Instrument of Accession that formed the
      legal basis for princely states to join either India or Pakistan after partition which allowed for the
      smooth accession of most princely states in 1947. The transitional period accorded to the princely
      states, which lasted from 1947 to 1956, also led to the former principalities becoming part of the
      Indian states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21. “Economic factors were the main reason for Japan’s decision to attack Pearl Harbour in
    1941.” Discuss.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   economic factors were the main reason for Japan’s decision to attack Pearl Harbour in 1941. Factors
   may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
   Candidates may refer to Japan’s long term economic needs, such as a scarcity of resources, a
   growing population and the effects of an economic depression at home, leading to a need for
   expansion. This was exacerbated by US economic sanctions in 1940 that deprived Japan of vital
   resources necessary for its military expansionism. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
   example the alliance between Japan, Germany and Italy, Japan’s desire to establish its own economic
   and political sphere of influence free from Western colonial rule, as well as the failed negotiations
   between Japan and the US. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.



22. Evaluate the social and cultural impact of globalization on Japan up to 1990.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the social and cultural impacts of
   globalisation on Japan up to 1990, weighing up its strengths and limitations or otherwise. Globalization
   refers to the process of increasing interconnectedness and interdependence among countries through
   the exchange of goods, services, information, technology, and ideas. Candidates may offer equal
   coverage of social impacts and cultural impacts of globalization or they may prioritize their evaluation
   of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Globalization has led to
   increased cultural exchange between Japan and the rest of the world. Japanese society has been
   exposed to foreign ideas, values, and lifestyles through media and the internet. Candidates may argue
   that this has resulted in the blending of traditional Japanese culture with Western influences, shaping
   new cultural expressions. Globalization has led to an increase in English language education in Japan,
   and this has facilitated international communication and expanded opportunities for employment and
   education abroad. There has also been an influx of immigrants to Japan and candidates may evaluate
   the impact of this cultural diversity on Japanese society. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence
                                                   – 15 –               M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

 23. “The Long March (1934–1935) made the most significant contribution to the rise of communism in
     China up to 1936.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
     the Long March made the most significant contribution to the rise of communism in China up to 1936.
     Candidates may point out how the Long March proved the resilience of the Chinese Communist
     Party (CCP) and the great distance covered allowed the CCP to cultivate support from many groups
     of peasants. In addition, the Long March’s success was used for propaganda purposes by the CCP.
     It was at the Zunyi Conference during the Long March that Mao Zedong regained power from the
     Soviets and imposed his own brand of communism. Other relevant factors may include the
     establishment of Jiangxi Soviet (1931 to 1934) where the Red Army developed a strong guerrilla
     force and where the CCP experimented with land reform. There may be discussion of the pivotal
     role Mao played in the rise of communism, especially his interpretation of Marxist ideology to suit the
     conditions of China, as well as his control of the Red Army that was used to carry out policies to win
     popular support. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.



 24. Evaluate the political and economic impact of Japanese rule on Korea up to the outbreak of the
     Sino-Japanese War.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political and economic impacts of
     Japanese rule on Korea up to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of political and economic impacts, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of
     them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
     transformation of Korea’s agricultural landscape that led to a deterioration of living conditions for the
     peasants, and the exploitation of Korean workers for cheap labour, as well as the monopoly the
     Japanese had on key positions in the colonial government and business sectors. Candidates may
     also refer to how Japanese rule resulted in increased agricultural production and the industrialisation
     of Korea’s economy. Other relevant impacts may be addressed, for example the strict political
     repression by the Japanese and subsequent flowering of Korean nationalism, encapsulated in the
     March 1st Movement (1919) and the Gwangju Students Anti-Japanese Movement (1929).
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 13: Impact of the Second World War on South-East Asia

 25. “Indonesian independence was achieved in 1949 mainly through violent methods.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     Indonesian independence was achieved in 1949 mainly through violent methods. Causes may
     predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may refer to the armed struggles by independence fighters to overthrow the Dutch, a prime example
     being the Battle of Surabaya (1945) which was the single greatest battle of the revolution and
     became the national symbol of Indonesian resistance. Candidates may also consider the various
     impacts of Dutch colonial rule. Firstly, it produced a new educated elite that was at the forefront of
     the Indonesian National Awakening. Secondly, the colonial suppression of national movements led
     to a radicalisation of the Indonesian nationalist movement, leading to calls for full independence, and
     increased post-war international pressure on the Dutch to grant independence. Other relevant
     factors may be addressed, for example the impact of the Japanese occupation on the independence
     movement. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.



 26. Evaluate the impact of the Second World War on one country in South-East Asia (excluding Dutch
     East Indies/Indonesia, Indochina/Vietnam, and Malaya).

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Second War World on
     one country in South-East Asia, excluding Dutch East Indies/Indonesia, Indochina/Vietnam, and
     Malaya, weighing up its importance or otherwise. The impacts may extend beyond the timeframe
     but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the
     emergence of nationalist movements in their country of choice and how the resistance against the
     Japanese armed and empowered these movements. Candidates may also refer to how the Second
     World War resulted in dire economic crises and widespread political instability, especially in
     European colonies. Other relevant impacts may be addressed, for example the deepening of social,
     political and economic divisions brought about by the war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

 27. “There was significant social change under Mao Zedong up to 1961.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that there
     was significant social changed under Mao Zedong up to 1961. Candidates may refer to the progress
     made in terms of women’s rights and status with reference to the 1950 New Marriage Law and/or
     the 1953 Election Law, as well as the education reforms that that allowed equal access to
     employment and career advancement. Candidates may argue that these laws, while signalling
     progress, did not result in significant change as ingrained prejudice still existed within the CCP and
     society more broadly. Education reforms also had limited success, with educational expansion more
     evident in urban than in rural areas and with preferential treatment given to children of Party cadres
     and government employees. In addition, the extension of the healthcare system, changes in socio-
     economic status, as well as in beliefs and value systems may be discussed. Other impacts may be
     addressed, for example the social impacts of the Great Leap Forward and the resulting famine.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.



 28. Discuss the reasons for the emergence of Deng Xiaoping as the leader of China.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the
     emergence of Deng Xiaoping as the leader of China. Candidates may refer to Deng’s track record
     in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a reason for his appointment as the General Secretary of
     the CCP in 1977. He was a pioneer of the CCP and was successful in ending the famine in the
     1960s, as well as gaining an impressive reputation in foreign affairs as assistant to Zhou Enlai. His
     abilities aside, Deng had the support of key Party members who facilitated his return to power several
     times. Candidates may also refer to Deng’s policies after his return to the Politburo and the ousting
     of the Gang of Four after Mao’s death which undermined his major opponent Hua Guofeng, who
     was a staunch follower of Mao Zedong and his policies which were by then unpopular. Other relevant
     factors may be addressed, for example the lack of credible opposition. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29. To what extent was French colonial rule the most important cause of the French Indo-
    China War (1946–1954)?

    The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that French
    colonial rule was the most important cause of the French Indo-China War (1946 -1954). Causes may
    predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
    may refer to the French desire to restore its colonial rule in French Indochina after Japanese
    occupation as a cause of war. American and British support for France’s aims was also a contributing
    factor and specifically British refusal to deal with the Viet Minh and armed hostility towards them meant
    that the French were able to return to Indochina. The Viet Minh on the other hand, following Ho Chi
    Minh’s declaration of Vietnamese independence in 1945, were determined to end foreign control and
    were willing to fight for independence. The development of communist threat strengthened US support
    for the French. Ho Chi Minh’s pivot towards the USSR and Communist China increased Cold War
    tensions and further increased Truman’s support for the French. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
    will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.



30. Examine the impact of ideology on the nature of the Khmer Rouge regime between 1975 and 1979.

    The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between ideology and the nature
    of the Khmer Rouge regime. Candidates may refer to the Khmer Rouge’s belief in a revolutionary
    programme that aimed to rid the nation of all forms of feudalism, capitalism and imperialism and, as
    a result, required constant vigilance against enemies of the revolution leading to an era of persecution
    and purges. Life under the Khmer Rouge was informed by integrating communism with pre-existing
    Cambodian religious and cultural ideas and led to the massive influx of Cambodians into the
    countryside and the implementation of collectivisation. Due to Khmer nationalism and its emphasis on
    national purity, the Khmer Rouge explicitly targeted all minorities and in particular, carried out
    genocide against the Vietnamese living in Cambodia. The aim of autarky, inspired by the self-
    sufficiency of Cambodia’s mountain tribes, led to a focus on agriculture before the industrialisation of
    Cambodia. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
    appropriate evidence.

    Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947.

31. Examine the causes and the results of the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War.

     The question requires that candidates consider the causes and results of the 1971 Indo-Pakistani
     War. Candidates may offer equal coverage of causes and results, or they may prioritize their
     examination of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may refer to the long-term tensions that existed between India and Pakistan after Partition that had
     led to the First and Second Indo-Pakistani wars. Specifically, Kashmir remained a contentious region
     that fuelled these tensions. In addition, the civil war between East and West Pakistan was arguably
     the immediate cause of the 1971 war. For results, candidates may refer to the creation of Bangladesh
     as an independent state, India’s emergence as a major player in the region and the signing of the
     Simla Agreement in 1972 which was an attempt to normalise relations between India and Pakistan.
     Other results may be considered, for example the impact of defeat on Pakistan politics and economy.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.



32. Discuss the political and social challenges facing Sri Lanka since 1972.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the political and
     social challenges facing Sri Lanka since 1972. Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and
     social challenges, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will
     be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the ethnic divisions that gave rise to a
     decades-long war between the Sinhalese and the Tamils. The violence of the Liberation Tigers of
     Tamil Eelam, a militant pro-independence organisation, also led to the interference of India that
     threatened the political sovereignty of Sri Lanka. Apart from civil ethnic strife, Sri Lanka also faced
     political instability due to an unstable democracy. Religious, cultural and language divisions also
     precluded social unity, as did class, caste and regional differences in Sri Lanka. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33. “The Whitlam government was a complete failure.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     Whitlam government was a complete failure. Candidates may offer equal coverage of positive and
     negative elements of the Whitlam government, or they may prioritize their assessment of one over
     the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
     significant social reforms implemented by Whitlam, including the introduction of Medibank and free
     university education. Other reforms introduced aimed to improve the lives of Australian women and
     indigenous communities, while economic mismanagement – in the context of global financial
     troubles in the 1970s – led to inflation and significant government debt. Other relevant factors may
     be addressed, for example the claim that the Whitlam government had many great ideas for reform
     but struggled to implement them, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

34. Compare and contrast the foreign policies of Australia and New Zealand up to 2005.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     Australia and New Zealand in terms of foreign policy up to 2005, referring to both throughout. There
     does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the common Cold War
     context around the creation of the ANZUS Treaty (1951), which drew both countries into alliance
     with the United States. The strong anti-communist stance of both nations saw both Australian and
     New Zealand troops serve in Korea and Vietnam, the latter conflict marking the first time that either
     nation had not fought alongside the British. Despite this, both nations remained members of the
     Commonwealth, although, after Britain’s joining of the European Economic Community, the two
     began to turn towards Asia, both diplomatically and economically. For contrasts, Australia’s
     relationship with the United States deteriorated during the period of the Whitlam government, while
     New Zealand’s anti-nuclear stance led to their suspension from ANZUS by the US in 1986, marking
     a cooling in foreign relations between the two countries. Each country’s respective relationship with
     the US would be rehabilitated, however, although New Zealand’s government condemned the 2003
     invasion of Iraq, contrary to Australia’s firm support. In addition, New Zealand’s more active role in
     the Pacific region might be offered as a contrast.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
     India) (1980–2005)

     35. “There was significant progress in the achievement of gender equality between 1980 and
         2005.” Discuss with reference to two countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that there was significant progress in the achievement of gender equality in two Asian countries
      (excluding China, Japan and India) between 1980 and 2005. Candidates may refer to women’s
      access to and achievements in primary, secondary and tertiary education to measure opportunities
      for women to improve their status and well-being. Candidates may also discuss gender gaps in
      hours worked, wages, occupations, career progression and unpaid work to assess the
      achievement of gender equality. Candidates may also refer to female participation in governance,
      such as the percentage of seats held by women in national parliaments, as a measurement of
      female representation and empowerment. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example,
      women’s access to healthcare but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.



     36. Compare and contrast the reasons for the emergence of terrorism in two countries of the region
         (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the reasons for the emergence of terrorism in two countries of the region, excluding China, Japan
      and India, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the denial of social justice and/or policies of discrimination as
      reasons for the emergence of terrorism in the two countries of their choice. Candidates may also
      discuss how many terrorist groups emerged as a result of religious fundamentalism, often in
      response to poverty, inequity and discontent, both real and perceived. Candidates can also
      contrast the level of state involvement in the establishment of terrorist groups, the political stability
      and structure of the countries chosen, as well as regional and international developments and
      circumstances that facilitate the emergence of terror groups. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
