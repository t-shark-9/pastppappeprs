           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1. Evaluate the importance of factors affecting the transmission of ideas and cultures in two societies.

   Candidates will make an appraisal of the factors affecting the transmission of ideas and cultures in
   two societies, weighing up their importance. The two societies may or may not be from the same
   region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the ideas and cultures, or they may prioritise their
   evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
   evaluate the importance of traders carrying goods and knowledge along the Silk Road; maritime
   trade facilitating the transmission of religion and ideas from Arab communities to Asia; pilgrimages by
   both Christians and Moslem that facilitated the inter-mixing of populations and ideas. The importance
   of the Crusades may also be evaluated as transmitters of culture and knowledge, especially from the
   Middle East to Europe. Other relevant factors may be evaluated such as the negative impact of the
   Black Death and the decline of the Mayan Empire, when a reduction in trade slowed down the
   transmission of ideas and culture. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.

2. Evaluate the significance of religious leaders in the government of two societies.

   Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of religious leaders in the government of two
   societies, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two societies may or may not be from the
   same region. Candidates may evaluate the significance of Pope Gregory VII’s conflict with King
   Henry IV of Germany over the supremacy of the Church over temporal rulers or the significance of
   Thomas Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury to the court and rule of Henry II. The significance of
   priests in Mayan society may be evaluated in relation to their crucial role as intermediaries with the
   gods as their knowledge of astronomy and the Mayan calendars ensured their valued role in the
   government of the empire. There may also be an evaluation of the significance of Mansa Musa or the
   Abbasid Caliphs who combined the roles of a religious and temporal leader. Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3. “Territorial disputes were the most important cause of war in the period 750–1500.” With reference
   to two wars, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
   territorial disputes were the most important cause of war in the period 750–1500. The two wars may
   or may not be from the same region. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly
   linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they
   may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the
   response. Candidates may appraise disputes created by the territorial expansion of emerging states,
   for example the Seljuk Empire during the Byzantine-Seljuk wars. There may be an appraisal of
   disputes over areas of religious significance, such as the Crusades. Similarly, candidates may
   appraise conflicts over territories of economic/strategic importance, for example the Hundred Years
   War. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example dynastic disputes, or tension over
   religious or ethnic differences, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.



4. Evaluate the significance of human and economic resources to the outcome of two wars, each
   chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of human and economic resources to the
   outcome of two wars, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two wars must be from
   different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of human and economic resources, or they
   may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
   response. Candidates may appraise the efficiency in the provision of soldiers and its impact on the
   outcome of the war. They may evaluate the means used to obtain soldiers through the feudal
   system, standing armies, or alliances. Candidates may also evaluate the mobilization of supplies,
   such as food and weapons, along protected routes. There may be an appraisal of the mobilization of
   economic resources to support the war effort using, for example, loans or taxes. Other relevant
   factors may be addressed, for example the role of leaders and the organization of warfare, but with a
   focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
   and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5. Discuss the nature of the power of two rulers, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the nature of power
   exercised by two rulers. The two rulers must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal
   coverage of the rulers, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both rulers
   will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to William I of England who supplemented
   his military power with feudal contracts, administrative reform and the import of Norman allies. They
   may discuss the brutality of Hongwu, to which was added a strengthened bureaucracy and secret
   police. There may be a discussion of the rule of Tamerlane and Basil II, who also combined military
   power with effective administration and fiscal reform. However, Harun al-Rashid's reliance on
   devolution of power, supported by ultra-loyal ministers proved insufficient to prevent numerous
   rebellions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

6. To what extent were two rulers successful in dealing with challenges to their power?

   The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which rulers were successful in dealing
   with challenges to their power. The two rulers may or may not be from the same region. Results of
   their policies may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
   the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two rulers, or they may prioritize their
   assessment of one of them. However, both rulers will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
   consider Tran Thanh Tong’s success in resisting the Yuans, which nevertheless left his son to
   defeat invasion. They may consider the successes of Baibars in defeating Sinjar and challenges
   from the Mongols and Crusaders. The second Bulgarian Empire’s record against multiple external
   challenges was mixed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
   by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                 M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7. Examine the impact of population expansion and movements on the economy of two societies, each
   chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between the impact of
   population movement and expansion on the economy of two societies. The two societies must be
   from different regions. Candidates may examine the Encomienda system in the Americas that often
   involved the displacement of indigenous people who became a source of free labour. In Europe, the
   crisis of the seventeenth century may be examined with reference to the decline in population that
   both contributed to, and exacerbated, economic problems. In Ming China, an examination of how
   population movement from areas affected by drought and bad harvests impacted the economy would
   be relevant, as would examination of how the capture and sale of slaves from Africa impacted the
   economy of both Africa and the American colonies. Other relevant interrelationships may be
   considered, for example the growth of mercantile companies to facilitate trade and growth of
   empires, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

8. “The use of printed text was the most important influence on religious expansion and conversion.”
   Discuss with reference to two societies.
   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the use of printed text was the most important influence on religious expansion and conversion in two
   societies. The two societies may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal
   coverage of religious expansion and conversion or prioritise the discussion of one of them. However,
   both aspects will feature in the response. Candidates may discuss the importance of the availability
   of religious tracts and copies of the Bible, often in the vernacular. In particular, the use of printed
   texts may be seen as an important method of conversion to Lutheranism with its emphasis on faith
   without the intercession of a priest. Other influences may be discussed, such as armed conflict, for
   example the Thirty Years War, that often compelled the conversion of populations to Catholicism or
   Protestantism. There may be discussion of the role of missionaries in the Americas, who often
   accompanied the conquistadores, and the use of violence and torture to convert indigenous people
   to Christianity. Other relevant factors may be discussed, such as economic incentives to encourage
   conversion where business and trade, for example, could be facilitated by adopting a different
   religion, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –8–                   M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9. Compare and contrast the reasons for colonial/imperial expansion of two Early Modern states, each
   chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
   two Early Modern states in terms of the reasons for colonial/imperial expansion, referring to both
   throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. The two Early Modern states must
   be from different regions. Reasons may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
   issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to religious reasons such as the desire to defend
   fellow religious practitioners or evangelise foreign populations, for example the Portuguese
   expansion into Africa. Candidates may also give an account of similarities and differences with
   reference to political reasons such as the capitalization of internal conflicts abroad, or exploits fuelled
   by personal ambitions. Candidates may also refer to the role of resources in colonial/imperial
   expansion. Mention may be made of empires that expanded in search of precious metals (Spanish
   Empire), control over agricultural land and water (Ajuran Sultanate), or commodities such as spices
   (Dutch Empire). Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

10. To what extent were rebellions a serious challenge to the colonial rule of two Early Modern states?

   The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which rebellions were a serious
   challenge to the colonial rule of two Early Modern states. The two states may or may not be from the
   same region. The challenges posed by the rebellions may extend beyond the timeframe, but they
   must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
   both states, or they may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a
   feature of the response. Candidates may appraise the extent of challenges posed by rebellions and
   their economic or political impact. For example, candidates may appraise the challenges posed by
   failed rebellions, such as the Bengal and Bihar rebellions in 1580; or successful ones, such as the
   British Colonies in North America in 1776. There may also be an appraisal of the enduring social
   impact of movements such as the Pueblo Revolt, or their inspiration to later independence
   movements such as Tupac Amaru's rebellion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
   clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –9–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11. “The most important causes of wars were political.” Discuss, with reference to two wars, each
    chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the most important causes of early modern wars were political. The two wars must be from different
   regions. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
   the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two wars, or they may prioritize their
   discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
   discuss the Dutch War of Independence where a desire for independence was an important political
   cause, as was the struggle for parliamentary rights in the case of the English Civil War. The Mughal
   conquest of northern India was made possible by the decline of the Delhi sultanate and judicious
   political alliances. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example economic and religious
   causes, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

12. Evaluate the significance of the organization of warfare to the outcome of two wars.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of the organization of
   warfare to the outcome of two wars, weighing up its importance or otherwise. The two wars may or
   may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two wars, or they
   may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response.
   Candidates may evaluate the significance of the Swedish recruitment system during the Great
   Northern War, Akbar’s mansabdari system in Mughal advances in India, the patient five-year build-up
   of forces by the Pueblo rebels or the highly-organized Japanese invasion of Korea (1592). Aspects of
   organization could include training and logistics. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
   example technological advances, leadership, tactics and strategy, but with a focus on the issue in the
   question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –               M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13. Examine the impact of two key individuals, each chosen from a different region, upon the origins of
    industrialization.

   The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between two key individuals and
   the origins of industrialisation. The two individuals must be chosen from different regions. Candidates
   may offer equal coverage of both individuals, or they may prioritise the examination of one above the
   other. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may examine the impact of Dom
   Pedro I of Brazil, who encouraged industrialisation through policies relating to trade and the building
   of factories. In Japan, the impact of Iwasaki Yataro (Mitsubishi) for transportation or Giemon Hiroso
   or Saihei Hirose (Sumitomo) for mining could be examined. In Britain, the impact of James Watt or
   George Stephenson and their contribution to transportation and infrastructure may be examined and,
   in the Americas, the impact of Eli Whitney. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for
   example, the availability of raw materials or state control of resources, but with a focus on the issue
   in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

14. “The organization of labour was the most effective way to improve labour conditions.” Discuss with
    reference to two countries, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the organisation of labour was the most effective way to improve labour conditions in two countries.
   The two countries must be chosen from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
   both countries, or they may prioritise the discussion of one of them. However, both will be a feature
   of the response. Candidates may discuss the emergence of trade unions that used strikes and
   collective bargaining to improve labour conditions. Initially, attempts in the US to establish unions
   proved relatively ineffective but government support for the AFL’s “bread and butter” unionism did
   lead to reforms. There may be discussion of US policies in Japan after WW2 which enshrined in law
   the right to join a union, leading to better labour conditions. In apartheid South Africa, condemnation
   from international companies led to the lifting of the ban on black worker unions. Other relevant
   factors may be addressed, for example, changing values that condemned worker exploitation or
   increased mechanisation that made labour conditions less arduous, but with a focus on the issue in
   the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 11 –                M23/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15. “Violent methods were more significant than non-violent methods in achieving
   independence.” Discuss, with reference to two states.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   violent methods were more significant than non-violent methods in achieving independence. The
   two states may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
   violent and non-violent methods, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
   both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the significance of non-
   violent methods such as peaceful protests and civil disobedience, as used by Gandhi in India. They
   may also discuss the significance of violent methods such as guerrilla attacks, as used in Cuba in its
   struggle against Spain, or open confrontations conducted through rebellions or conventional battles,
   as seen in Peru. Candidates may review the contribution of violent and non-violent methods to the
   independence process in light of their associated benefits and costs. Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

16. “Economic difficulties were the most important challenge faced in the first ten years of
    independence.” Discuss, with reference to two states.
   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   economic difficulties were the most important challenge faced in the first ten years of independence.
   The two states may or may not be from the same region. The challenges posed may extend beyond
   the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
   offer equal coverage of both states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
   both states will be a feature of the response. Candidates may review the challenges in financing a
   comprehensive transport, medical or educational infrastructure, as seen in recently independent
   African states. Similarly, there may be a discussion of the economic challenges posed by the
   concentrated ownership of agricultural land or industries. Candidates may also discuss the
   challenges in establishing a fiscal system, or promoting investment, for example in Peru. Other
   relevant factors, such as social and cultural challenges, may be addressed but with a focus on the
   issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
   by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17. “The development of electoral systems was the most significant factor in the emergence of
    democracy.” Discuss, with reference to two democratic states.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the development of electoral systems was the most significant factor in the emergence of
   democracy. The two states may or may not be from the same region. Factors may predate the
   timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
   equal coverage of the two states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
   both states will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the impact of proportional
   representation as well as the extension of the suffrage to women.. They may discuss the import of
   the British electoral system into India which led to Congress-led governments in the short-term.
   Ghana’s first-past-the-post system, however, descended into alternating military and civilian
   government between 1966 and 1981. The expansion of democratic systems in the US as a
   consequence of the civil rights movement and in South Africa, post-apartheid, would also be
   relevant. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the development of parties and
   economic and social conditions, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
   or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

18. Evaluate the impact of responses to domestic crises in two democratic states.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of responses to domestic
   crises in two democratic states, weighing up the importance or otherwise of the impact. The two
   states may or may not be from the same region. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must
   be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two
   states, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both states will be a feature
   of the response. Candidates may evaluate the response to the Argentinian economic crisis of the
   late 1980s which saw the liberalisation of the economy but only a short-lived recovery, or the
   response of the Weimar governments to hyperinflation, which resulted in stabilisation at the cost of
   dependence on overseas debt. The response to the civil rights crisis in the US saw extension of
   voting rights and less segregation, but little economic change. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
   will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19. To what extent was ideology the most important factor in the emergence of two authoritarian states?

   The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which ideology was the most important
   factor in the emergence of two authoritarian states. The two states may or may not be from the same
   region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states or may prioritise their assessment of one
   of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to anti-
   Semitism and the recovery of German prestige as significant aspects of Hitler’s ideological appeal.
   Mao’s focus on the peasantry as the vanguard of the revolution and the link between ideology and
   land reform may be seen as essential to success of the PLA in the civil war. It may be argued that
   Castro was rather evasive in committing firmly to an ideology and how this may have been an
   important factor in the emergence of revolutionary Cuba. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
   for example, the use of propaganda, fear of foreign invasion or a military seizure of power, but with a
   focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.

20. “A successful foreign policy was the most important factor in the maintenance of power.” Discuss
    with reference to two authoritarian states.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that a
   successful foreign policy was the most important factor in the maintenance of power in two
   authoritarian states. The two states may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer
   equal coverage of both states, or may prioritise the discussion of one of them. However, both states
   will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the success of Hitler’s foreign policy that
   increased the regime’s popularity. For Mao, participation in the Korean War demonstrated that
   China was no longer a “victim” of imperialism. Nasser’s success in the Suez Crisis arguably
   cemented his presidency that was not threatened even by defeat in the Six Day War. In Argentina,
   however, defeat in the Malvinas/Falklands War led to the removal of the military junta from power.
   Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the primacy of a successful domestic policy
   or the suppression of opposition but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
   or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21. Evaluate the impact of technological developments on the outcome of two wars, each chosen from a
    different region.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of technological
   developments on the outcome of two wars, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two wars
   must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they may
   prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response.
   Candidates may evaluate the impact of technological developments in weapons, for example nuclear
   bombs in WWII. There may also be an appraisal of the limitations posed by successive
   technological developments that rendered previous ones obsolete, for example gas masks.
   Alternatively, they may evaluate limitations to the impact of technology posed by difficult terrain, as
   seen in the Vietnam War. Candidates may also appraise the contribution of technological
   developments that facilitated the transport of troops and equipment, secured communication, or
   improved medical treatment. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example mobilization of
   human and economic resources or the involvement of foreign powers, but with a focus on the issue
   in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

22. “The most significant effects of war were economic.” Discuss, with reference to two wars, each
    chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   the most significant effects of war were economic. The two wars must be from different regions.
   Effects of the wars may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
   raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they may prioritize
   their discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates
   may discuss the costs of conducting wars, which may include addressing deficits, or the repayments
   of bonds. Similarly, mention may be made of the costs of rebuilding infrastructure or relocating
   displaced populations. Candidates may also discuss the economic impact of peace settlements,
   such as the reparation payments and loss of industrial areas imposed on Germany by the Treaty of
   Versailles. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example territorial changes, political, social
   and demographic impact, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23. With reference to two leaders, each from a different region, evaluate their impact on the
    development of the Cold War.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of two leaders on the
   development of the Cold War, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The leaders must be
   chosen from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the leaders, or they may
   prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both leaders will be a feature of the response.
   In the context of the development of the Cold War, candidates may evaluate the impact of Stalin,
   whose policies in eastern Europe and support of North Korea contributed to rising tension. Castro’s
   role in accepting Russian missiles onto Cuban soil, and support for overseas socialist revolutions, or
   Nixon’s adoption of détente, rapprochement with China and withdrawal from Vietnam, may be
   evaluated. Other choices could include Truman, the pioneer of containment who faced down the
   Soviet challenge over Berlin in 1948, Brandt, the architect of Ostpolitik, or Mao, who fought the US in
   Korea, stoked tension with the Islands Crisis, broke with the USSR, and opened the door to US
   diplomacy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

24. “Cold War crises were mainly caused by superpower aggression.” Discuss, with reference
   to two crises, each chosen from a different region.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   Cold War crises were mainly caused by superpower aggression. The two crises must be from
   different regions. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
   raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two crises, or they may prioritize
   their discussion of one of them. However, both crises will be a feature of the response. Candidates
   may discuss Soviet actions in Berlin in 1948, which may be viewed either as aggression to expel the
   Allies, or defence of a sphere of influence. There may be discussion of the Cuban Missile Crisis,
   which may be regarded either as aggression by the USSR in placing missiles so close to the US, or
   as Khrushchev’s defence of a socialist ally. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
   the role of leaders such as Nasser, whose actions, arguably, provoked the Suez Crisis, or Kim Il-
   Sung, whose invasion of South Korea caused war, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
   Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
   evidence.
