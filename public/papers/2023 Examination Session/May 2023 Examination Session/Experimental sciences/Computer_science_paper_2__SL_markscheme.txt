Subject details:         Computer science SL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 45 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

(e)   Award [3 max]
      Used to save frequently used, complex queries;
      Though a view doesn’t store data, we refer to a views as “virtual tables,”
      you can query a view like you can a table;
      A view can combine data from two or more tables, using joins, and also just contain
      a subset of information;
      Views don’t store data directly/draw data from tables;
      This makes them convenient to abstract, or hide, complicated queries;
      Views automatically update (dynamic) as the data in tables change;
      (Static/materialised) views capture the query at that moment in time/to allow for faster
      retrieval with large datasets;
      Views improve security because you can give access to a view without access to the
      underlying database;
      Some types of views allow you to insert / update / delete multiple tables within the one view;

      Note: must be related to views of queries not queries themselves


(f)   Award [3 max]
      A DDL is used to specify the schema of a database / defines parameters and data
      A DDL allows you to define the tables, fields, datatypes e.g CREATE TABLE;
      A DDL allows you to specify keys/create relationships;
      A DDL allows you to modify schema (e.g. DROP, ALTER);


(g)   Award [3 max]
      Data about the rents given out will be accurate at any point in time;
      data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including
      constraints, cascades, triggers;
      Consistency allows user to trust the data for decision making;
      Consistency is need for transactional operations to be carried out correctly/ACID;
      Consistency allows data to be transferred (to other systems) with confidence;
      Consistency allows data to be analysed using algorithmic tools/multiple formats cannot be
      analysed accurately;
      Consistency is important or it leads to integrity issues (e.g. foreign keys unlinked to primary
      keys);
      Without consistency it leads to confusion and misinterpretation of the data/ need of accuracy;
      Compliance with the car industry may be a legal requirement;

           Amount of acceptable data loss;
           Time to full recovery/Recovery Time Objective(RTO);
           Cost (Instant recovery requires failover systems);
           Resources/Architecture; (volume of data) // size of database not accepted;
           Legal regulations/sensitivity of data;

     (b)   Award [4 max]
           Backup and Restore/The DBA restores the database from backup;
           Using BACKUP and RESTORE SQL commands;
           After making periodic backups of the database (may be full or incremental);

           Log Recovery/ Point in time recovery/rollback;
           Backup is recorded in the log files and restored at that point;
           Transaction after that point are added back in;
           If the failure was due to an error in a transaction, the DBA can also "undo" the transaction to
           revert the database to a consistent

           Instant Recovery/database mirroring/recovery in place;
           Redirects user workloads to the backup server/backup database is brought online;
           When recovery is completd the original system is used with the interim transactions added;

           Deferred update (NO-UNDO/REDO or write-ahead logging);
           The system consults the transaction log and any transactions that were not fully written to the
           database (deferred) are redone;

           Mark as [2] and [2].

     (c)   Award [4 max]
           Access control levels;
           same as in a school, admistrators can see everything, teachers can see some, students can
           see very little;
           Any example to explain the access control can be accepted;

           Maintaining data anonymity;
           for example the personally identifiable information (PII) that could potentially identify a person
           in the database is located in a separate table;
           and the person is given a unique identifier like PER0001 so the anonymity of the person
           can be ensured;

           Note: password alone not accepted, encryption not accepted

           Mark as [2] and [2].

           A simulation is the application of a model (to a specific situation)
           A simulation uses a variety of inputs in the model to determine the overall balance of the
           budget;

           // award for [1] answers that do not refer to the context.


     (b)   (i)    Award [2 max]:
                  The simulation could demonstrate that the money spent (on healthcare) will be
                  inadequate in five years;
                  This could help prevent shortages in the budget;

           (ii)   Award [2 max]:
                  The variables used to run the simulation may be flawed/incomplete/inaccurate;
                  This could lead to the wrong budgets being set leaving areas incorrectly funded;


     (c)   Award [4 max]:
           Data could be collected more frequently;
           To detect more subtle changes in trends that would allow the predictions to be more accurate;

           Data could be collected to cover more/different variables;
           to give a smaller chance for outliers/unusual data from skewing the overall model;

           Award [1 max] for conclusion

           An ethical issue is invasion of privacy;
           It is possible that the data could be shared with third party individuals;
           Citizens may not trust the government to use the data for purposes other than those for
           which it was collected;
           Citizens may be concerned as to how securely their data is stored;

           personal data is essential to get the best quality model ;
           so that accurate tax, health, social security, earnings information may be used;

           Suggest any trade-off between the invasion of privacy and the need for accurate information
           for future resource allocation;

      Scenario 1: Technical aspects related to the search engine having difficulty in
      accessing deep web.
      A limitation of many search engines is that they are unable to access the deep web;
      The Information in the deep web is held in databases which is not easily accessible or
      visible;
      or searchable using popular search engines since the pages are dynamic and the content of
      the pages will vary depending on the query;
      Information is only accessible via a query of the database;
      More sites being developed using dynamic pages rather than static; less information will be
      accessible on a superficial level;
      Rate of growth of information is ‘exponential’; ability to search and index increasing volumes
      of data is a challenge;
      number of deep-web databases is increasing and this limit indexing as it is not available;
      Structure of data is not consistent;
      lack of data standards – making interpretation/indexing difficult;
      Further Data may be behind a paywall; or be password protected;

      Scenario 2: Consequential aspects related to the search engine having difficulty in
      accessing deep web.
      It would impact the whole purpose of having a search engine as it would miss out on a lot of
      information;
      content that gets added to the deep web servers missing valuable and unique information
      such as academic journals, scientific research, which may restrict the users from accessing
      comprehensive and relevant search results;
      leading to the inefficiency of search engines;
      Inability for the search engines to access data from deep web may lead to unrealistic or
      unreliable data predictions/trends which may lead to lack of trust among the users for search
      engines;

      Note to the examiners: Accept the points from one cluster only, ignore the points from
      second cluster if there is a mix of both.

           Award [2] for audio compression
           Award [2] for book/image compression.
           Award [2] for the discussion of appropriateness

           Appropriateness of Lossy Compression for music album & e-books:
           Reduced file size;
           Which results in faster downloads / less storage capacity required to store the media /
           reduced bandwidth requirement;

           Inappropriateness of Lossy Compression:
           Loss of Quality; Artifacts and Distortion / loss of resolution / text;
           Irreversible Data Loss;

           On the album/audio:
           At normal settings the impact will be minimal. The file compression will reduce the accuracy
           of the inaudiable frequencies;
           but this will do little to reduce audiable sound quality;
           Further compression below that of CD quality or reducing the bit rate may result in reduce
           quality of reproduction;

           Inappropriateness of lossy compression for the ebook/images
           The reduction in the quality of the images may result in reduced range of colours being used
           for each pixel;
           this becomes more marked with more compression;
           It also may result in the pixelation of the image;

           Evaluation - candidates need to make a judgment regarding the impact of compression
           underpinned by a balanced analysis.

      It will protect artist’s work from unauthentic distribution to public in general.
      Enables tracking of the viewers (system dependent);
      Make the images harder to find in a search and therefore reduces the accessibility to the
      artists works;
      Would need to have some form of authentication to prevent bogus accounts being
      established – some users may not be keen on providing suitable verification of identity;
      May encure additional cost to the artist;
      Does protect access but reduces visibility and accessibility to the artists work;
      The login is server side and likely to be more secure;
      Those having access may further distribute the downloadable images/copyrighted material
      without the artist’s consent;

      Script option
      Script may be disabled or not function across all browsers; Script is client side and may be
      disabled;
      Images are downloaded and stored in cache and may be accessible/retrievable by an
