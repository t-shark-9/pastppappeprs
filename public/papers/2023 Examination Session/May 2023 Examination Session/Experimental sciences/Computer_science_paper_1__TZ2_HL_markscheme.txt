Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
semi-colon (;).

An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
accepted.

Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
in the markscheme then award the mark.

Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
“FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of               eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses        descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the           explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions        This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                   explanation etc.

3.   Award [2 max]
     Because Unicode is an (established) standard for data representation/ a single encoding scheme
     for all languages and characters;
     So, data can be used/transported through many different systems/ platforms/ devices;

     Because of the difference between ASCII and Unicode in the number of bits used to encode
     (ASCII (8-bits) and Unicode (16/32 bits));
     It can represent over a million characters/ ASCII cannot be used to encode the many types of
     characters found around the world;

     Because Unicode can be defined with different character encoding like UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32,
     etc.;
     And is used to represent many (over a million) characters from many (more than 150) modern and
     historic scripts (along with emoji);

     Award [1] for structure and [1] for methods/properties.

     A collection is a grouping of a variable number of data items into a single unit;
     that need to be operated upon together;

     A collection is a term used to describe a data structure designed to contain multiple elements of
     any type;
     and methods which make this data useful; Accept example methods, such as methods given in IB
     pseudocode: hasNext(), getNext(), resetNext(), etc. ;


     A collection is a class used to represent a set of similar data type items as a single unit (such as an
     array list, linked list, stack, queue);
     and methods used for efficient data manipulation/ and the set of methods that are common to all
     data items;

7.   Award [2 max]
     Award [1] for each comparison up to [2].

     RAM is a volatile memory (which could store the data as long as the power is supplied) whilst ROM
     is a non-volatile memory (which could retain the data even when power is turned off);
     Data stored in RAM can be altered whilst data stored in ROM can only be read;
     RAM is used to store the data that has to be currently processed by CPU whilst ROM stores the
     instructions required during bootstrap of the computer;
     RAM- large physical chip size/ higher capacity/expensive whilst ROM- small size/ less
     capacity/cheaper;
     The CPU can access the data stored in RAM whilst the CPU cannot access the data stored on
     ROM (unless the data is stored in RAM);

9.   Award [2 max]
     Award [1] for stating a disadvantage and award [1] for an expansion.

     Performances drop;
     Because of the time to switch among applications/ time taken to swap pages/blocks of data from
     secondary memory to RAM;

     Processing time slows down/ more time required to complete the task;
     As secondary storage devices have slower access times than RAM;

     May require more secondary storage/ take up more space;
     Because part of the disk is reserved for virtual memory, hence additional storage space might be
     necessary;

     Increases power consumption;
     Because of the increased overall processing time;

10.
       (a)   Award [2 max]
             Award [1] for identifying an issue (benefit or problem) caused by the introduction of
             a new computer system which transforms how end users perform and interact, x2.

             Examples (the list is not exhaustive):
             Need for training;
             lack of knowledge of the end-users about the new system/ lack of ability to use the new
             system/ resistance to training?;

             Resistance to changes;
             turnover-some end users leave the organisation, end user not giving feedback or
             requirements for the new system;

             End-user satisfaction;
             end-users excited about changes? increased efficiency/ productivity/ increased employee
             morale;

             Change in roles/ role specification;
             agreements/ disagreements on job duties/ fear of redundancy;

             Poor processes management;
             employees may not understand what is expected of them/ employees could feel that new
             practices are in conflict with previous/ existing practices;


      (b)    Award [2 max]
             Legacy system is an outdated computer system/(application) software that is still in use/ still
             meets the needs it was originally designed for/ is essential for the organization;
             it cannot be updated /does not receive support and maintenance/ doesn’t allow for growth/ is
             incompatible with current (new) more advanced solutions;




       (c)   Award [1 max]
             Observation ;
             Survey/Questionnaire ;
             Interview;
             Brainstorming (get as many ideas as possible from a representative group of end users);
                                             – 10 –             M23/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ2/XX/M




(d)   Award [3 max]
      Example 1
      Data loss/data available in legacy system but after migration process it is not available in the
      new system;
      because data is accidentally deleted/ something causes data to become corrupted/ viruses/
      physical damage/incomplete transfer;
      cost involved in rectifying data loss leads to financial risk for the organization / sets back
      productivity / reputation risk (can cause the organization to lose customers;

      Example 2
      Data Corruption/ Data integrity;
      format and content of data in legacy system and new system is different / incompatible data/
      anomalies or redundant or duplicated data or presence of non-meaningful data;
      this affects the efficiency/ it can totally beat purpose of migration;

      Note: Students may write an example for this, such as: the legacy system may have had
      gender details of the employees, but the new system may not have/require them).
                                             – 11 –             M23/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


(e)   Award [3 max]
      Example 1
      Parallel running is less risky than direct changeover;
      if the new system fails, operation can continue under the old system;
      whilst in direct changeover if the new system fails the data is lost/ operation cannot continue;

      Example 2
      Parallel running allows organization to test the new system (all features of the new system
      can be fully trialled);
      and the organization switches over to the new one if(when) it is found to be more efficient
      than the old one;
      Whilst in direct changeover the new system is started without ensuring that the new system
      is working correctly/efficiently before the old system is terminated;

      Example 3
      Parallel running ensures new system runs without errors;
      if errors are found, refer to old system to resolve and make modifications to new system;
      Whilst in direct changeover the old system is terminated (and the new system is started
      without ensuring that it is working correctly);

      Example 4
      Parallel running allows staff can be trained in the new system gradually;
      helps them gain confidence in new system;
      as the changeover does not happen immediately;

      Note: Reward other suitable responses.

(f)   (i)    Award [1 max]
             self -instruction/self-learning;
             formal classes;
             remote/online training;

             Note: Reward other suitable methods.

      (ii)   Award [3 max]
             Award up to [2] for any advantage to end-user (trainee) evaluated, and up to [2] for
             any disadvantage evaluated.
             Note: The response should match the method of training identified in (i).

             Award marks for the advantages and disadvantages involving convenience, cost, time,
             effectiveness, comprehensiveness, learning needs, etc.

             Example 1 (remote /online training)
             advantage of online training is that it allows end-users to attend classes from any
             location of their choice;
             with reduced financial costs (because online learning eliminates the cost of
             transportation / meals / the study materials are cheaper (available online));
             but there are also disadvantages such as: struggle with focusing on the screen for long
             periods of time/ technology issues (requirements of internet enabled devices / smart
             devices / live internet connection) /sense of isolation/ time zone differences between
             the trainer and the trainees;

             Example 2 (formal classes)
             Direct interaction between the trainer and trainees (end-users); no technology
             issues/no sense of isolation;
             Verified study materials and trainers allows immediate answer to end-users/ gives end-
             user (trainees) the benefit of receiving immediate feedback;
             but it involves high costs (the expenses associated with end-user training);
             it is time intensive/requires time away from the work;

             Example 3 (self-instruction)
             Self-learning is neither location constrained nor time-bound (end users can choose
             their own pace/materials/methods);
             less stressed out about failing in front of another person/no social interaction;
             lack of input from trainers can lead to slower progress than f2f training;
                                                   – 13 –              M23/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ2/XX/M

            physical distance/ the number of network devices which have to be crossed;
            the performance of each of the devices (between sender and receiver), for example weak
            processor;
            quality/characteristics of network equipment (such as the router or transmission media/
            cable/fibre/wireless);
            number of network users (and their demand at any particular time);

            Accept other reasonable answers, such as the type of encryption used or the encryption
            strength/ server bandwidth/ size of the user data/ type of protocol used, etc.;


      (c)   Award [3 max]
            (Because) compression reduces the size of a file/ size of data/ the number of packets to be
            transmitted;
            Which reduces transmission time/ consumes less bandwidth;
            And can result in significant cost savings;


      (d)   Award [2 max]
            Encryption scrambles readable text;
            So, it can only be read/understood by the person who has the decryption key;

            Data encryption translates plain text into ciphertext;
            That can be viewed/read in its original form only if it is decrypted with the correct key;


      (e)   Award [2 max]

      Negative impact on mental health
      Not all jobs suit home working


      Note: When a change to the work pattern is identified it can be an advantage or a
      disadvantage. For example, working at home can improve interaction with the family but also
      provide a distraction to work.

12.   (a)   Award [5 max]
            a pre-set value of temperature stored/ user inputs a desired temperature;
            sensor measures/detects temperature;
            and it (regularly) sends the temperature readings to the microprocessor;
            microprocessor compares the actual readings with the pre-set/inputted temperature;
            if the temperature is above or below the pre-set temperature/ too hot or too cold;
            then the microprocessor sends signal to output transducer to adjust temperature accordingly;
            These steps are (continuously) repeated in a cycle;

            Note: Award [1 max] for AD or/and DA conversion, if explained in the response.

      (b)   Award [2 max]
            A feedback system samples the output signals (temperature) then a sample (a fraction of the
            output signal) is fed back to the input;
            to change/modify the input signal;
            in such a way as to produce an output signal that differs substantially from the output signal
            produced in the absence of such feedback / as to increase or decrease the temperature in
            the house;

            The output value is (continuously) compared to the desired value to produce an error value/
            difference/ adjusting factor;
            the error value/ difference/ adjusting factor is fed to input;
            to determine the next action/ to achieve a desired outcome/pre-set temperature in the room;

(c)   (i)    Award [2 max]
             Award [1] for identifying a function of an OS, and [1] for a description.

             Award marks for any of the OS functions, for example, memory management,
             processor management, device management, coordination between other software and
             users, security, control over system performance, file management, etc.

             For example
             Processor Management/Scheduling;
             the OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor / how much
             processing time each process has/ keeps tracks of the status of processes/ allocates
             the CPU to a process/ de-allocates processor when a process is no more required;


      (ii)   Award [2 max]
             Note: Accept reasons such as security, customisability, size, speed.
             Because a dedicated operating system is custom made/ designed specifically for the
             computer system/ for the available hardware;
             to do a specific function at maximum efficiency/ makes the most efficient use of the
             available resources;

             Because the OS is specifically made to manage the control system/ for cell phone (that
             does not require to do any general-purpose tasks);
             meaning that it is faster than universal OS;

(d)   Award [4 max]
      Award marks for giving an account of similarities and differences between centralized
      system and distributed system.

      Award [2 max] for centralized system.
      Easier to use- it allows control at a central point;
      Controlled by a single processor;
      Centralized system is easy to physically secure;
      More cost-efficient for small systems (such as a house);
      Large systems are usually more expensive to install due to the connectivity required between
      the various components;
      Highly dependent on the network connectivity (the system can fail if the nodes lose
      connectivity as there is only one central node).
      If it must be expanded (new equipment and processes added) downtime is usually required;
      When the software program must be modified it requires downtime/ can have inadvertent
      effects on the existing control scheme;
      When the central server is down, no other entity is there to send/receive responses/requests;
      In case of a local failure (usually) the whole system stops working;

      Award [2 max] for distributed system.
      Not beneficial to build and operate small distributed systems because of the low cost/benefit
      ratio;
      Controlled by a collection of independent processors;
      Distributed system is usually easier to install due to fewer connection issues;
      Easier to modify/upgrade without disturbing other processes;
      Allows individual control of settings at each unit or room, so it is more flexible;
      More complicated to control remotely;
      Difficult to know which node failed/ which node responded;
      In case of a local failure, all other processes continue to work;

      (b)   Award [4 max]
            Award [1] for a disadvantage and [1] for the elaboration, x2.

            recursion is memory intensive;
            because memory (call stack) is used to store all the intermediate arguments and
            return values/ could lead to stack overflow (if there is a large amount of data);

            recursion can be slow;
            if not implemented correctly/if too many recursive calls occur;

            difficult to think of the logic of a recursive function/ complexity of the paradigm;
            hard to construct/ analyse /understand the code;


      (c)   Award [2 max]
            isEmpty() returns a Boolean value True if the stack size is 0, else it returns False/ checks if
            stack is empty or not;
            it is used/called in conditions in if/while statements/ it is called before an attempt is made to
            remove the value from the stack;
            to prevent performing operations on an empty stack/ to prevent stack underflow error;
