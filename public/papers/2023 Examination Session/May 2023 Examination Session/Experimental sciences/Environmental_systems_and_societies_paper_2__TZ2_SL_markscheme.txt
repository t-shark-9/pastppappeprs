Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP2
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.
                                                  –5–                 M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


                                              Section A
1.   (a)   State the category with the lowest approximate percentage of threatened species in
           Figure 1(a).                                                                              [1]

           bony fishes;


     (b)   Outline two reasons why amphibians have the highest approximate percentage of
           threatened species, as shown in Figure 1(a).                                              [2]

           a.   They require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats/specialised niches so more
                likely to be affected by habitat loss/limitations;
           b.   They have permeable/soft skin more vulnerable to disease/UV/pollution;
           c.   Few amphibians have great public/charismatic appeal attracting
                protection/conservation efforts;
           d.   They generally have very limited parental care so offspring more vulnerable /
                high mortality rate in offspring;
           e.   They often depend on small bodies of water that are particularly vulnerable to
                drought/global warming/human development of wetlands

           Note: Only credit marks that are explicitly related to the vulnerability of amphibians.
           General factors such as habitat destruction, hunting or climate change alone are
           TV.


     (c)   Using Figure 1(a), state the approximate percentage of sharks and rays that are
           threatened.                                                                               [1]

           Accept any percentage in the range 31-34;


     (d)   Describe one reason why there is a lack of available data for sharks and rays.            [1]

           a. they are very mobile/migratory species;
           b. the oceans are vast and difficult/expensive to do research in / they have a
              widespread habitat range;
           c. difficult/dangerous species to capture and tag / rays have cryptic behavior;
           d. they inhabit inaccessible regions;
                                             –6–                 M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


(e)   Outline three reasons why the trend for corals is different to the other categories
      shown in Figure 1(b).                                                                   [3]

      corals …
       a. are sedentary/cannot migrate (to avoid pollution or other risks);
       b. are r-selected species so high mortality rates (in planktonic phase);
       c. (have delicate symbiotic relationship) highly sensitive to small changes in
          abiotic conditions;
       d. are impacted worldwide through ocean acidification (causing bleaching);
       e. are impacted worldwide by global warming/climate change /warmer waters
          (causing bleaching);
       f. inhabit areas with high human polluting activity such as urban waste/agricultural
          run-off/oil spills/aquaculture;
       g. have value as souvenirs/trophy/collectors’ items;
       h. are fragile/easily damaged unintentionally (by boats/nets/storms etc);
       i. have very slow growth rates (in sedentary phase);
       j. have limited ranges/ocean depths/habitats where they can live;

      Credit any response that is consistent with the increasing trend of extinction in
      corals.
      Do not credit “pollution” alone there must be reference to a relevant source of
      pollutant as in MPf


(f)   Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are based on records for species diversity. Identify one other
      factor that may be measured to assess the diversity of life on Earth.                   [1]

      a. genetic diversity;
      b. habitat diversity;

      Do not accept “evenness/equitability” or “richness” they are already included within
      concept of species diversity
                                                   –7–                 M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe the overall trend in the recorded annually averaged data shown in Figure 2.          [2]

           a. ozone initially declined;
           b. ozone stabilized / began to increase slightly;

           Note: do not credit descriptions of the projected values
           Allow 1 mark for overall decline
           Precise dates are not necessary for credit (i.e. accept change occurring around
           2000).


     (b)   State one chemical responsible for the trend in the recorded annually averaged data
           between 1980 and 1990 shown in Figure 2.                                                      [1]

           halons/CFCs/HCFCsHBFCs/N2O/methyl bromide/methyl chloroform/carbon tetrachloride/
           chlorine/bromine:

           Note: do not credit HFCs/ODSs


     (c)   Outline one impact of low concentrations of stratospheric ozone on plants.                    [1]

           a. cell damage on leaves / reduced leaf size/reduced plant growth/
              photosynthesis;
           b. reduced phytoplankton in oceans;


     (d)   Identify the year that stratospheric ozone is predicted to return to 1980 levels in Figure 2. [1]

           Accept any year in range 2041-2043;


     (e)   Describe two reasons for the projected change in ozone levels after 2020 in Figure 2.         [2]

           a. Montreal Protocol resulted in unprecedented international cooperation to
              address loss of ozone (and its influence still continues);
           b. banned use of CFCs/ phasing out of CFCs/ ozone depleting substances
              /refrigerants/aerosols/recycling of refrigerants;
           c. alternatives to CFCs (HFCs/HCFCs) were developed reducing harm to ozone;
           d. education/awareness campaigns led to changes in consumer preferences;
           e. ozone reforms due to natural reversible chemical reactions/processes / ODSs
              eventually begin to break down/dissipate;


     (f)   Outline one factor that may affect the reliability of the model projections in Figure 2.      [1]

           a.   oversimplification that does not take into account full range of factors;
           b.   hard to predict consumer/government/industry behaviour;
           c.   production and release of new ozone depleting substances;
           d.   countries not following the Montreal Protocol / black market ODSs;
           e.   difficult to obtain accurate data;
                                                  –8–                 M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


3.   (a)   State one storage of fresh water not shown in Figure 3.                                   [1]

           Lakes/rivers/glaciers/groundwater/aquifers/reservoirs/organisms other than plants;


     (b)   State one input of water into the atmosphere not shown in Figure 3.                       [1]

           Evaporation (from inland waters/oceans/soil) / sublimation / water vapour from
           respiration/combustion;


     (c)   Describe the negative feedback mechanism by which cloud formation may moderate
           global temperature.                                                                       [2]

           temperature rises  more evaporation clouds increase;
           more shade/albedo/more reflection of incoming solar radiation  temp decreases;

           Credit valid responses that include details above in form of full sentences or accurate
           diagrams.
           Do not credit water being a GHG trapping outgoing heat or latent heat flow, as these are part
           of positive feedback. Do not credit to increased outgoing heat from Earth's surface (sensible
           heat flow) as this is due to lack of clouds (not formation).
           Do not credit “more clouds  more precipitation => cooling effect”, as this is, at best a
           regional impact


     (d)   Evaluate the role of reforestation in the mitigation of climate change.                   [4]

           Pros:
           a. more trees absorb more CO2 so reduce global warming;
           b. reforestation simultaneously increases biodiversity;
           c. requires minimal technology/labour/expense;
           d. forests are naturally renewable carbon sink/indefinite lifetime;
           e. reforestation requires minimal ongoing maintenance;
           f. regulating local weather /decreasing extreme weather patterns;
           g. protects against run-off/soil erosion/desertification;
           h. it increases evapotranspiration which may increase cloud cover increasing
               albedo/mitigating warming

           Cons:
           a. it increases evapotranspiration so more water vapour/greenhouse gases/warming;
           b. more trees reduce reflected heat into atmosphere/absorb more heat so increase warming;
           c. it reduces land availability for agriculture/urban growth;
           d. it is not feasible in all locations/habitats;
           e. it requires large areas to make a significant difference;
           f. can be an expensive/unpopular solution;
           g. can take a long time/period of growth before it has significant impact on CO2;

           Award [3] max if only pros or only cons are given.
           Pro MPh and Con MPa may contradict one another but both are valid hypotheses and
           deserve credit
           Do not credit vague responses like “improves air quality” or “reduces air pollutants”
                                                   –9–                 M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


                                               Section B
4.   (a)   Outline the transfers and transformations of energy as it enters and flows through
           the first trophic level of a food chain.                                                  [4]

           Transfers: [3 max]
            a. solar/light energy absorbed by leaves/chlorophyll/chloroplasts/plants;
            b. stored as chemical energy in glucose/organic compounds/ATP;
            c. chemical energy transported around plant/moved from leaves to other
               plant organs;
            d. chemical energy in plant biomass eaten by herbivores/passed on to
               decomposers;
            e. heat energy radiated from plant into atmosphere;

           Transformations: [3 max]
            f. conversion of light to chemical energy in photosynthesis;
           g. conversion of chemical to heat energy in respiration / all metabolic processes
               release heat (heat loss);
           h. conversion of chemical to heat energy through decomposition;
           i. conversion of chemical energy to other forms of energy (e.g. kinetic) in various
               metabolic processes;
           j. conversion of solar energy to electric energy in the photosynthetic apparatus;

           Do not credit reflection of light (albedo), as energy does not enter 1st trophic level.
                                           – 10 –              M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


(b)   Describe how the use of fossil fuels may impact the abiotic conditions of oceanic
      systems.                                                                                 [7]

      a. CO2/greenhouse gas emissions lead to increasing global/atmospheric
         temperatures;
      b. higher levels of atmospheric CO2 lead to more CO2 dissolved in ocean water...;
      c. ...which leads to ocean acidification / reduced pH;
      d. increased global temperatures cause rise in ocean temperature...;
      e. …also cause expansion/increase in volume of ocean/rising sea levels (same MP
         if linked to melting of glaciers MPg);
      f. ...also may increase algal growth, which absorbs more sunlight / making water even
         warmer / increasing oxygen availability in water (locally);
      g. …also cause melting of ice caps/glaciers...;
      h. … which, in turn, dilutes salinity of surrounding sea;
      i. rising sea temperatures reduce solubility of gases/available oxygen [no
         contradiction with local impact in MPf];
      j. changing salinity/temperatures will cause changes in ocean currents/conveyor
         belt;
      k. oil spills may cause pollution/reduce light penetration...;
      l. ...regionally reduced light penetration/killing of phytoplankton results in reduced
         oxygen levels (due to reduced photosynthesis) [no contradiction with local
         impact in MPf];
      m. changing weather patterns/events may affect wind-driven oceanic currents;
      n. lower pH may cause death of sea life (e.g. coral) which will decompose
         (aerobically), thus increasing CO2 in oceans / or decompose anaerobically in
         deep ocean, thus increasing CH4;
      o. Increased GHGs/temperature may increase ocean evaporation leading to loss of
         water / increased salinity;

      Note: Do not credit mention of acid rain, NOx, SO2 emissions affecting ocean pH.
      Do not credit use of oil in manufacturing petrochemicals (e.g. plastics)
      Credit may be given for any other valid responses linking fossil fuel use to some
      abiotic change in oceans.

(c)   With reference to named societies, to what extent are their energy choices affected more by
      their geographical location than the environmental impact of any energy resource?             [9]

           The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
           offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
           markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with “understanding
           concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
           seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
           deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

           Answers may demonstrate:
           • understanding concepts & terminology of renewable/non-renewable
              energies; wind; solar; hydro; geothermal; fossil fuels; global warming/climate
              change; acid deposition; ozone depletion; photochemical smog; oil spills;
              political/economic factors affecting energy choice; availability, cost,
              sustainability of each energy source; energy security etc.
           • breadth in addressing and linking energy choices of a range of different
              countries in different locations to environmental impacts and local availability of
              energy sources.
           • examples of named energy sources, and countries energy choices, and
              environmental impacts; etc.
           • balanced analysis evaluating extent to which energy choice is determined
              more by location or environmental impact.
           • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
              examples given e.g. Although worldwide there is increasing awareness of
              environmental impacts of energy sources like fossil fuel, the quest of energy
              security and economic prosperity may lead to continuous dependence on locally
              abundant fossil fuel reserves.

5.   (a)   Outline how the principles of sustainability can be applied to the use of soil systems.        [4]

           a. sustainability is meeting current needs whilst not depleting potential to meet future needs;
           b. any minerals extracted from soils by crops need replacement (e.g. organic
              fertilizer, crop rotation, land fallow);
           c. humus content/decomposer communities need to be maintained/conserved (e.g.
              use compost, green manure crops, reduced tillage, agroforestry farming);
           d. irrigation methods should be managed to avoid depletion of local water supply
              (e.g. drip irrigation, avoid over-irrigation);
           e. irrigation methods should be selected to reduce leaching of minerals/run-off (e.g.
              sub-surface irrigation, avoid over-irrigation);
           f. measures should be taken to prevent erosion of soil particles (by wind/water)
              (e.g. cover crops, terracing, contour ploughing/cropping, windbreaks);
           g. soil texture should be maintained by avoiding excessive trampling (caused by
              heavy machinery, intensive livestock farming/overgrazing);
           h. use of biological pest control in place of insecticides/toxins;

           Credit any valid example, equivalent to above marking points, showing how a soil
           resource was replaced and/or recovered after its extraction, use or management
           and/or ensuring sustainable consumption and production.
           Do not credit reference to bedrock, mining ores and underground aquifers.


     (b)   Explain how the process of succession leads to an increase in the fertility and
           resilience of soils.                                                                           [7]

           a. growth of pioneer species (soil bacteria and fungi) promotes weathering of rock;
           b. death of colonizing species increases humus/organic content;
           c. greater humus content/production of soil particles increase water-holding capacity;
           d. dead organic matter promotes growth of decomposer community;
           e. decomposers provide nutrient cycling/maintain available minerals;
           f. growth of root systems provides stability/prevent erosion;
           g. plant roots increases weathering of rock / humus formation;
           h. burrowing animals (e.g. earthworms) improve soil texture / aeration;
           i. increased animal community adds organic material (e.g. feces) for decomposition;
           j. vegetation cover provides shade reducing evaporation losses;
           k. greater diversity of plants leads to greater diversity of soil microbes further promoting
              weathering / adding minerals;
           l. introduction of K-selected species leads to more stable ecosystems / soil system;
           m. throughout the process of succession, soil is gradually becoming deeper;

(c)   Compare and contrast a named terrestrial food production system with a named
      aquatic food production system in terms of their efficiency and environmental impacts.     [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
      markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with “understanding
      concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
      deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may demonstrate:
      • understanding concepts & terminology of terrestrial and aquatic food production;
         sustainability, food chains/trophic levels; productivity; respiratory
         losses; harvesting efficiency; use of fertilisers/pesticides/antibiotics; methane
         production; genetic degradation through escapees; overfishing; desertification; etc.
      • breadth in addressing and linking food production systems with a range of
         potential impacts on the environment and issues of efficiency.
      • examples of aquatic and terrestrial food production systems along with examples of
         associated impacts.
      • balanced analysis evaluating the relative efficiency and overall environmental
         impact of aquatic vs. terrestrial production systems.
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and examples
         given e.g. Most impacts arising from aquatic food production tend to be more
         localised than the global impacts associated with terrestrial farming although, in
         terms of energy, terrestrial farming tends to be more efficient through harvesting at
         lower trophic levels.

6.   (a)   Outline four ways in which changes in the population of one species may reduce
           the carrying capacity of an environment for another species.                            [4]

           a. growth of a predator/carnivore population may reduce carrying capacity (cc) for
              a prey species;
           b. prey species may decline, reducing cc of predator;
           c. introduction/increased population of a competitor species would reduce the cc of
              other competing species / increased human population encroaching on habitats
              results in reduced cc of many species;
           d. spread of a parasite/pathogen/disease organism may reduce cc for a given host
              species;
           e. a host species may decline, reducing cc for pathogen;
           f. growth of a herbivore population may reduce cc of a plant species;
           g. a plant species may decline thus reducing cc for herbivore species;
           h. in a mutualistic/symbiotic relationship, the decrease in the population of one
              species would reduce cc for the other;
           i. some species may evolve defence/resistance/adaptation mechanisms that
              decrease cc for predator/parasite/competitor species (respectively);
           j. decline of an "ecosystem engineer species" (e.g. beavers, elephants) would
              decrease cc for many other species (in the same community); ["keystone"
              species would earn credit only in the context of MPs on predation and
              mutualism]

           Do not credit responses that give no indication of impact on carrying capacity e.g.
           “predation” or “species preying on other species” does not indicate for which species
           cc is reduced, so gains no credit.
           Allow [1 max] for reference to human population (considered MPc).
           Credit may be gained through appropriate examples.


     (b)   Explain how natural processes may lead to the formation of new species.
                [7]

           a. mutation/sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity in a population;
           b. those individuals with (genetically determined) features best adapted/more fit to
              their habitat/environment;
           c. ...will survive / survival of fittest;
           d. …and will reproduce more successfully / leave a larger number of offspring;
           e. passing on their offspring these favorable genes/traits;
           f. favorable traits will dominate in population / gene frequency/genetic
              characteristics of a population changes over time;
           g. a population may become divided due to plate tectonics/changing landscapes/
              colonization of newly emerged habitats/islands;
           h. ...leading to genetic isolation of parts/subpopulations;
           i. the separated populations may undergo (divergent) evolution / under different
              selective pressures / in different habitats;
           j. accumulating different mutations over generations;
           k. the differences between separated populations may prevent them from
              interbreeding / when populations are unable to interbreed and produce fertile
              offspring they are considered separate species;
           l. the process of natural selection led to speciation;

           Credit may be gained through appropriate examples.

(c) Different environmental value systems will have different reasons for conserving species
    diversity.
    Discuss how these different reasons may influence the approach a society takes to
    conservation.                                                                                [9]

    markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with “understanding
    concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
    seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
    deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

     Answers may demonstrate:
     • understanding concepts & terminology of ecocentric/anthropocentric and
        technocentric value systems; biorights; intrinsic value; use and non-use values;
        deep ecology; cornucopian values; stewardship; ex situ/in situ conservation;
        keystone species; flagship species; reserves; zoos; breeding/re-introduction
        programmes; gene banks; etc.
     • breadth in addressing and linking a range of value systems with different
        perspectives on the nature of living things/species and thus different conservation
        strategies and goals.
     • examples of different value systems; different perspectives on living things and
        different conservation strategies.
     • balanced analysis evaluating the relative merits and demerits of different value
        systems and associated conservation strategies toward an appropriate conclusion.
     • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and examples
        given e.g. The kind of value, be it economic, moral or intrinsic, that we attach to
        living things, will inform strategies we employ for conservation. Ultimately, however,
        economic value, though it can change with time, will be the most significant deciding
        factor in a community’s choice of conservation strategies.

7.   (a)   Outline four ways in which the geographical location of a human population may
           influence its ecological footprint.                                                       [4]

     Populations may have lower EFs due to...
          a. ...living in tropical regions where there is greater vegetation to capture C
              emissions;
          b. ...living in regions with high land productivity (e.g. temperate grasslands) as less
              land is required to satisfy consumption rate;
          c. ...living in regions with high rainfall (e.g. NW Europe, SE Asia) results in high
              replenishment rate of water sources;
          d. …living in coastal regions with high potential for production of renewable energy
              (e.g. wind in Denmark, tidal in Sarawak, Malaysia)
          e. ...living in mountainous (e.g.Tibet) or desert regions (e.g.Sahara) with harsh
              (climatic) conditions, which result in small population sizes;

     Populations may have higher EFs due to…
          a. …living in mountainous regions as high erosion/low productivity makes them
              less suitable for local farming;
          b. …living in higher latitudes/altitudes as climate is often harsh and more energy is
              needed for heating;
          c. …living in desert/semi-arid regions (e.g. North Africa, Central Asia) where there
              is limited fresh water available for agriculture and consumption;
          d. …living in tropical/Mediterranean island regions that require high
              energy/imported food/water to support tourist industry;
          e. …living in flat/plain regions (crossed by rivers) with optimal conditions for human
              settlements leading to high population sizes (e.g. Eastern China);
          f. ...living in regions with large supplies of freshwater/lakes/glaciers (Great Salt
              Lake, USA) leads to increased water wastage;

     Credit any valid points that connect location to consumption patterns (high consumption rate
     => high local EF) or local productivity (high production rate => low local EF) & impacts on
     environment (high impact => high EF).
     Do not credit different locations with similar EF arguments; e.g. “mountainous region with
     high wind potential for production of wind energy” and “windy island with high aeolian energy
     production”.
     Do not credit converse KSs; e.g. “mountainous regions more vulnerable to erosion” &
     “flatland less vulnerable to erosion”.

(b)   A wild population of herbivores may provide a sustainable resource for human
      consumption. Describe practical procedures for estimating the natural income from
      such a resource.                                                                             [7]

      a. natural income is the yield obtained from natural resources/capital;
      b. to measure natural income of herbivores, one needs to measure net (secondary)
         productivity;
      c. measuring annual change/increase in population size/biomass;
      d. population would need estimating at start and again after end of year/given time
         period;
      e. population can be measured using mark/release/recapture / Lincoln index;
      f. a sample is caught using traps and marked;
      g. they are released and given time to mix with whole population;
      h. traps are re-set/second sample is caught to identify proportion marked;
      i. total population is estimated using equation: n1 x n2 / nm / number caught in 1st
         sample times total number caught in 2nd sample (after marking) divided by
         number of marked individuals in 2nd sample;
      j. difference in population (divided by given time period) is the net
         productivity/natural income;

      Note: Credit can be given if equivalent procedures to measure change in biomass
      rather than population size are described.


(c)   To what extent do different pollution management strategies influence the ecological
      footprint of a human population?                                                             [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be

      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
      deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may demonstrate:
      • understanding concepts & terminology of ecological footprints; production of
         food and processing of wastes; the three levels of the pollution management model
         as presented in syllabus; altering activity/controlling release/clean-up and
         restoration; setting emission standards; monitoring; scrubbers; catalytic converters;
         carbon sinks; mitigation/adaptation strategies; etc.
      • breadth in addressing and linking a range of pollution management strategies
         such as safe/green alternatives, end-of-pipe management, clean-up/restoration
         strategies and their specific implications for ecological footprints.
      • examples of specific pollution management strategies adopted by named
         communities/locations and their impacts on ecological footprints.
      • balanced analysis of the extent to which the pollution management strategy is
         increasing or decreasing the ecological footprint of a society.
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and examples
         given e.g. Pollution management strategies that alter human activities or control the
         release of pollutants may effectively reduce a community’s ecological footprint but
         clean-up and restoration frequently involves an addition to the ecological footprint in
         order to process pollutants already released into the environment.
