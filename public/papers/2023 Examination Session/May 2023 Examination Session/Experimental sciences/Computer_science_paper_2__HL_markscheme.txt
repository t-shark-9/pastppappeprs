Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

(e)   Award [3 max]
      Used to save frequently used, complex queries;
      Though a view doesn’t store data, we refer to a views as “virtual tables,”
      you can query a view like you can a table;
      A view can combine data from two or more tables, using joins, and also just contain
      a subset of information;
      Views don’t store data directly/draw data from tables;
      This makes them convenient to abstract, or hide, complicated queries;
      Views automatically update (dynamic) as the data in tables change;
      (Static/materialised) views capture the query at that moment in time/to allow for faster
      retrieval with large datasets;
      Views improve security because you can give access to a view without access to the
      underlying database;
      Some types of views allow you to insert / update / delete multiple tables within the one view;

      Note: must be related to views of queries not queries themselves


(f)   Award [3 max]
      A DDL is used to specify the schema of a database / defines parameters and data
      A DDL allows you to define the tables, fields, datatypes e.g CREATE TABLE;
      A DDL allows you to specify keys/create relationships;
      A DDL allows you to modify schema (e.g. DROP, ALTER);


(g)   Award [3 max]
      Data about the rents given out will be accurate at any point in time;
      data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including
      constraints, cascades, triggers;
      Consistency allows user to trust the data for decision making;
      Consistency is need for transactional operations to be carried out correctly/ACID;
      Consistency allows data to be transferred (to other systems) with confidence;
      Consistency allows data to be analysed using algorithmic tools/multiple formats cannot be
      analysed accurately;
      Consistency is important or it leads to integrity issues (e.g. foreign keys unlinked to primary
      keys);
      Without consistency it leads to confusion and misinterpretation of the data/ need of accuracy;
      Compliance with the car industry may be a legal requirement;

           Amount of acceptable data loss;
           Time to full recovery/Recovery Time Objective(RTO);

           Legal regulations/sensitivity of data;

     (b)   Award [4 max]
           Backup and Restore/The DBA restores the database from backup;
           Using BACKUP and RESTORE SQL commands;
           After making periodic backups of the database (may be full or incremental);

           Log Recovery/ Point in time recovery/rollback;
           Backup is recorded in the log files and restored at that point;
           Transaction after that point are added back in;
           If the failure was due to an error in a transaction, the DBA can also "undo" the transaction to
           revert the database to a consistent

           Instant Recovery/database mirroring/recovery in place;
           Redirects user workloads to the backup server/backup database is brought online;
           When recovery is completd the original system is used with the interim transactions added;

           Deferred update (NO-UNDO/REDO or write-ahead logging);
           The system consults the transaction log and any transactions that were not fully written to the
           database (deferred) are redone;

           Mark as [2] and [2].

     (c)   Award [4 max]
           Access control levels;
           same as in a school, admistrators can see everything, teachers can see some, students can
           see very little;
           Any example to explain the access control can be accepted;

           Maintaining data anonymity;
           for example the personally identifiable information (PII) that could potentially identify a person
           in the database is located in a separate table;
           and the person is given a unique identifier like PER0001 so the anonymity of the person
           can be ensured;

           Note: password alone not accepted, encryption not accepted

(d)   Award [5 max]
      Award [1] for each advantage of using data segmentation as a strategy up to [2 max].
      Award [1] for each disadvantage of using data segmentation as a strategy up to [2 max].
      Award [1] for a substantiated conclusion.

      Advantages of using database segmentation:
      Allows different data to be grouped by similar feature (example wholesale and retailer
      separated) // must have example for mark;
      products that have unique features, as this will allow them to identify which products/design
      they should offer and which benefits they should promote;
      significant differences in socio-economic status in different geographic areas, or where there
      is significant changes in lifestyle across regions;
      can help gain an understanding of customer behaviour;
      can be used to implement target marketing;
      allows resources to be allocated efficiently;
      can help with customer retention (giving the customer what they want);


      Disadvantages of using database segmentation:
      assumes that all consumers in a geographic area are similar in needs;
      assumes similar needs are there for consumers;
      lacking in innovation, as they could end up focusing on existing needs/benefits rather than
      look at other opportunities and other ways of meeting customer needs;
      increases the complexity of a company's data management;
      Increases the costs in collecting, analysing and segmenting data; // must identify high cost
      may lead to privacy concerns;
      Over-segmenting may lead to narrow focus and missing out on marketing trends;

      Conclusion:
      Generally database segmentation is relevant when the segmentation is more microscopic
      and deals with subsets rather than a very broad divide/segmentation;

      Forecasting is a form of data mining that can predict how certain attributes within the data will
      behave in the future; (looking for patterns and trends);
      Examples include: analysis of buying transactions to predict what customers will buy under
      certain discounts, how much sales volume a store will generate in a given period and
      whether deleting a product line will yield more profits;
      In such applications, business logic is used coupled with data mining techniques;
      provides evidence-based insights to guide decision-making;
      without data analytics it would be impractical to analyse large volumes of data;
      machine learning can be used for forecasting/predictive analysis/trends;
      links/associations between different types of data can be made automatically;

      Scenario 1: Technical aspects related to the search engine having difficulty in
      accessing deep web.
      A limitation of many search engines is that they are unable to access the deep web;
      The Information in the deep web is held in databases which is not easily accessible or
      visible;
      or searchable using popular search engines since the pages are dynamic and the content of
      the pages will vary depending on the query;
      Information is only accessible via a query of the database;
      More sites being developed using dynamic pages rather than static; less information will be
      accessible on a superficial level;
      Rate of growth of information is ‘exponential’; ability to search and index increasing volumes
      of data is a challenge;
      number of deep-web databases is increasing and this limit indexing as it is not available;
      Structure of data is not consistent;
      lack of data standards – making interpretation/indexing difficult;
      Further Data may be behind a paywall; or be password protected;

      Scenario 2: Consequential aspects related to the search engine having difficulty in
      accessing deep web.
      It would impact the whole purpose of having a search engine as it would miss out on a lot of
      information;
      content that gets added to the deep web servers missing valuable and unique information
      such as academic journals, scientific research, which may restrict the users from accessing
      comprehensive and relevant search results;
      leading to the inefficiency of search engines;
      Inability for the search engines to access data from deep web may lead to unrealistic or
      unreliable data predictions/trends which may lead to lack of trust among the users for search
      engines;

          Award [2] for book/image compression.
          Award [2] for the discussion of appropriateness

          Appropriateness of Lossy Compression for music album & e-books:
          Reduced file size;
          Which results in faster downloads / less storage capacity required to store the media /
          reduced bandwidth requirement;

          Inappropriateness of Lossy Compression:
          Loss of Quality; Artifacts and Distortion / loss of resolution / text;
          Irreversible Data Loss;

          On the album/audio:
          At normal settings the impact will be minimal. The file compression will reduce the accuracy
          of the inaudiable frequencies;
          but this will do little to reduce audiable sound quality;
          Further compression below that of CD quality or reducing the bit rate may result in reduce
          quality of reproduction;

          Inappropriateness of lossy compression for the ebook/images
          The reduction in the quality of the images may result in reduced range of colours being used
          for each pixel;
          this becomes more marked with more compression;
          It also may result in the pixelation of the image;

          Evaluation - candidates need to make a judgment regarding the impact of compression
          underpinned by a balanced analysis.

      For [6] both Ontology and Folksonomy must be discussed.

      Ontology is key part of the Semantic web stack;
      Ontology is the formal naming; and definition of the types, properties, and interrelationships
      of the entities that exist for a particular domain of discourse;
      Whereas:
      folksonomy is a system where the users/public apply public ‘tags’ to tag content;
      or information, such as web pages, photos, videos, podcasts, tweets, scientific papers and
      others;
       “tagging” refers to a “voluntary activity of users who are annotating resources with term-so-
      called “tags” – freely chosen from an unbounded and uncontrolled vocabulary”;

      Ontology supports knowledge engineering, data mining etc by developing the vocabulary for
      that domain;
      This is searchable by software using the specialist ontology language;
      Structures, like the Dublin core and other metadata structures are developed to facilitate this
      and are part of a supportive framework – the RDF resource Description Framework – (part of
      the semantic web stack);
      Language is unambiguous, formalized, often complex but is consistent (not easily
      customized or personalized);
      This leads to more structured and organized data which can be manually and automatically
      processed – enabling sharing and reuse;

      Folksonomy lacks the consistency and structure;
      Often tags are relevant to individual or small group, multiple variations on tags and lack the
      broader structure offered by the likes of the RDF/Dublin core or formal use of metatags;
      Tags may not be broadly accessible and may not be widely known (though some like #metoo
      are);
      Presents issues with spelling and personalization/ambiguity;
      Often poorly applied;
      Variation and personalization provides some structure but the lack of consistency and large
      amount of variation means access is difficult and reuse at times challenging;

           Award [1] for including an example;

            A class (e.g. House class) is a blueprint / definition / specification (that defines all variables
            and methods that are needed) and an instantiation of a class is creates a (new) object of that
            class [1] (e.g. a (new) object of an actual house giving its actual address etc [1];


       (e) Award [2 max].
           A static variable is used when it is to be a class variable (belongs to the class not to the

           It is used when all objects of that class are to have the same value for the static variable;
           It will not be instantiated when a new object is created;
           If the value of a static variable is changed, it will be changed in all instances of that class;
           It does not require an object of that class to be accessed;

(f)   Award [2 max].
      Both classes House and Apartment need a static (integer) variable count;
      that is incremented whenever a new object of that class is created;

      A static variable (e.g total) could be defined in the Property class;
      Which is incremented every time a House or Apartment object is instantiated;

      A static method in the Property class retrieves the total number of house and apartments;

            Programs will be easier to follow;
            Because all data and methods are in the same place;

            Ease of testing;

(c) Award [3 max].
    Inheritance reduces the amount of coding in the sub-class / reduces repetition of code;
    By allowing sub-classes to inherit the methods / attributes of their superclass;
    Therefore, leading to time being saved in the development of code;

    Inheritance reduces maintenance overhead;
    Because modifications to the super class are automatically inherited by the subclasses;
    Reduces the errors when writing code;

    Inheritance allows for further expansion / simplifies future development;
    As other subclasses can inherit from the classes already present;
    Or add additional functionality specific to the sub-class;

      Award [1] for an attempt at a recursive call for both cases;
      Award [1] for correct boundaries in both recursive calls;

      Example answer:
      public Owner binSearch(String name, int low, int high)
      {
          if (high<low)             // allow (low>high)
          {
             return null;
          }
          else
          {
              int middle = (low+high)/2;
              Owner current = contacts.get(middle);
              if (current.getName().equals(name))       // allow '==' or '='
              {
                return current;
              }
              else
              {
                if (name.compareTo(current.getName())<0)    // allow < or >
                {
                   return binSearch(name, low, middle-1); // do not allow middle
                }
                else
                {
                  return binSearch(name, middle+1, high); // do not allow middle
                }
              }
           }
        }
