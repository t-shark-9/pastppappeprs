      The stack TOWNS holds several town names, and the name "Cardiff' is on the top of the
      TOWNS stack (see Figure 1a).

      An algorithm is needed that will reverse the contents of the TOWNS stack. The name "Geneva"
      should be on top of the TOWNS stack after reversing its contents (see Figure 1b).

            TEMP is initialized.

      (a )   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode to calculate the sum of all values stored in the
             DICEDIAL array.                                                                            [3]

      numbers in row R. If the numbers are not repeated, it returns 0, otherwise it returns the
      repeated number.

      The DuplicateNurn I) sub-program will produce the following from the values used in Figure 2:

                                 DuplicateNum I DICEDIAL, o) returns 2

                                 DuplicateNurn (DICEDIAL, 1 I returns 4

      highest row total and the indexes of all the rows with that total.

      highest row total is 16, and it occurs in the rows with indexes 3 and 4.
