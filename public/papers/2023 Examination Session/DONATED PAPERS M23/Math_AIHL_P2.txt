Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

       the cheapest direct flights in dollars ($) between cities.

       (a)      Explain why the graph can be described as "connected", but not "complete".                 [2]

       (b)      Find a minimum spanning tree for the graph using Kruskal's algorithm.

                State clearly the order in which your edges are added, and draw the tree obtained.         [3]

       (c)     Using only the edges obtained in your answer to part (b), find an upper bound for the
               travelling salesman problem.                                                                [2]

       Ronald lives in New York City and wishes to fly to each of the other cities, before finally
       returning to New York City. After some research, he finds that there exists a direct flight
       between Los Angeles and Dallas costing $ 26. He updates the graph to show this.

       (d)      By using the nearest neighbour algorithm and starting at Los Angeles, determine a
                better upper bound than that found in part (c).

               State clearly the order in which you are adding the vertices.                               [3]

(Question 4 continued)

     (e)   (i)    By deleting the vertex which represents Chicago, use the deleted vertex
                  algorithm to determine a lower bound for the travelling salesman problem.

           (ii)   Similarly, by instead deleting the vertex which represents Seattle, determine
                  another lower bound.                                                                     [5]

     (f)   Hence, using your previous answers, write down your best inequality for the least
           expensive tour Ronald could take. Let the variable C represent the total cost,
           in dollars, for the tour.                                                                       [2]

     (g)   Write down a tour that is strictly greater than your lower bound and strictly less than
           your upper bound.                                                                               [2]

     The three countries of Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands meet at a single point
     called Vaalserberg.

     To support future transport planning, a I 0 km circle was drawn around Vaalserberg on a map.
     A study was carried out over five years to determine what percentage of people living in
     each of these countries (within the I 0 km circular region) either stayed in their own country
     or moved to another country within the circle.

     From this study, the following movements were observed during the five years.
     • From Belgium, 5 % moved to Germany, and 0.5 % moved to The Netherlands.
     • From Germany, 2 % moved to The Netherlands, and 1.5 % moved to Belgium.
     • From The Netherlands, 3 % moved to Germany, and 2 % moved to Belgium.

     All additional population changes within the circular region may be ignored.

     (a)   Represent the above information in a transition matrix T.                                  [3]
     At the end of the study, the population of the Belgian side was 26 000, the population of the
     German side was 240 000, and the population of The Netherlands side was 50 000.

     (b)   By using T, find the expected population of the German side of Vaalserberg 30 years
           after the end of the study.                                                                [4]

     For matrix T there exists a steady state vector




     where u 1 , u2 and u3 are the proportions of the total population on the Belgian side,
     the German side and The Netherlands side respectively.

     The steady state vector u may be found by solving a system of equations.

     (c)   (i)    Determine these equations that are to be solved.

           (ii)   By solving your system of equations, find u.                                        [3]

     (d)   Use your answer to part (c)(ii) to determine the long-term expected population of
           the German side.                                                                           [2]

     (e)   Suggest two reasons why your answer to part (d) is not likely to be accurate.
           You may comment on both the model and the situation in context.                            [2]

     The gardener in a local park suggested that the number of snails found in the park can be
     modelled by a Poisson distribution.




     (a)    Suggest two observations that the gardener may have made that led him to suggest
            fuis m��-                                                                                    �

     Now assume that the model is valid and that the mean number of snails perm' is 0.2.
     The gardener inspects, at random, a 12m2 area of the park.

     (b)    Find the probability that the gardener finds exactly four snails.                            (3]

     ( c)   Find the probability that the gardener finds fewer than three snails.                        (2]

     (d)    Find the probability that, in three consecutive inspections, the gardener finds at least
            one snail per inspection.                                                                    [3]

     Following heavy rain overnight, the gardener wished to determine whether the number of
     snails found in a random 12m 2 area of the park had increased.

     (e)    State the hypotheses for the test.                                                           (2)
     (f)    Find the critical region for the test at the I% significance level.                          [3]

     (g )   Given that the mean number of snails per m2 has actually risen to 0.75, find the
            probability that the gardener makes a Type II error.                                         (3)
