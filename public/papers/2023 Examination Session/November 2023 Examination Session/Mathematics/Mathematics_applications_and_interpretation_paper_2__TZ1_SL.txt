Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Ansel is designing a racing track for a local bicycle club. The following diagram shows an
     incomplete portion of the track.

     Ansel wants to design the track such that the inner edge is a smooth curve from point A to
     point B, and the other edge is a smooth curve from point C to point D. The distance between
     points A and B is 90 metres.

                                                                               diagram not to scale

     Ansel then walks 32 metres in a direction perpendicular to [AB] to get from point M to point E.
     Point E is the centre of a circle whose arc will form the smooth curve between points A and B
     on the track, as shown in the following diagram.

     It is believed that the running times of family movies follow a normal distribution with mean
     88 minutes and standard deviation 6.75 minutes.

     It is decided to perform a χ 2 goodness of fit test on the data to determine whether

     Ruben wants to buy a car for a price of 285 000 South African rand (ZAR). He goes to a
     bank to get a loan to buy the car. To be eligible for the loan, Ruben must make an initial
     down payment equal to 25 % of the price of the car.

     The bank offers him a 5-year loan for the remaining balance, with a 4.5 % nominal interest
     rate per annum, compounded monthly. Ruben will pay the loan in fixed payments at the end
     of each month.

     (a)   (i)	Find the original amount of the loan after the down payment is paid.
                 Give the exact answer.

           (ii)   Calculate Ruben’s monthly payment for this loan, to two decimal places.                [5]

           the life of the loan, to the nearest ZAR. Do not include the initial down payment.            [2]

     Ruben would like to repay the loan faster and increases his payments such that he
     pays 4600 ZAR each month.

     (c)   Find the total number of monthly payments he will need to make to pay off the loan.           [2]

     This strategy will result in Ruben’s final payment being less than 4600 ZAR.

     Mosaic Industries is an international company that sells cell phone cases. Their market

     (f)   (i)	Find P ′(x) .

           (ii)   Show that the salesperson’s selling price does not maximize their average
                  monthly profit.                                                                        [4]

     Mosaic Industries negotiates a new deal with their phone case supplier. Under the new
     deal, the supplier agrees to discount the cost of each case based on the number of cases
     purchased by Mosaic Industries. The cost charged by the supplier for each case can be
     found using the function

                                          C (n) = 10 − 0.0001n

     where n represents the number of cases sold by Mosaic Industries.

     (g)   Find the function that can be used to find Mosaic Industries’ average monthly profit
           using the new deal from the supplier.                                                         [3]

     (h)   Hence, find the selling price, per case, that Mosaic Industries should choose in order
           to maximize their average monthly profit under the new deal.                                  [2]
