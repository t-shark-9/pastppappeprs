Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Madhu is designing a jogging track for the campus of her school. The following diagram
     shows an incomplete portion of the track.

     Madhu wants to design the track such that the inner edge is a smooth curve from point A to
     point B, and the other edge is a smooth curve from point C to point D. The distance between
     points A and B is 50 metres.

                                                                           diagram not to scale

     Tiffany wants to buy a house for a price of 285 000 US Dollars (USD). She goes to a bank
     to get a loan to buy the house. To be eligible for the loan, Tiffany must make an initial down
     payment equal to 15 % of the price of the house.

     The bank offers her a 30-year loan for the remaining balance, with a 4 % nominal interest
     rate per annum, compounded monthly. Tiffany will pay the loan in fixed payments at the end
     of each month.

     (a)   (i)	Find the original amount of the loan after the down payment is paid.
                 Give the exact answer.

           (ii)   Calculate Tiffany’s monthly payment for this loan, to two decimal places.                [5]

           the life of the loan, to the nearest dollar. Do not include the initial down payment.           [2]

     Tiffany would like to repay the loan faster and increases her payments such that she
     pays 1300 USD each month.

     (c)   Find the total number of monthly payments she will need to make to pay off the loan.            [2]

     This strategy will result in Tiffany’s final payment being less than 1300 USD.

     Howell Industries is an international company that sells travel coffee mugs. Their market
     research predicts that the average number of mugs they will sell each month is modelled
     by the equation

           will sell at this price.                                                                     [2]

           average monthly income, before expenses, at any selling price, x .                           [1]

     Howell Industries has 10 000 EUR of fixed monthly operational costs. Additionally,

     Howell Industries negotiates a new deal with their mug supplier. Under the new deal,
     the supplier agrees to discount the cost of each mug based on the number of mugs
     purchased by Howell Industries. The cost charged by the supplier for each mug can
     be found using the function
                                          C (n) = 10 − 0.0001n

     where n represents the number of mugs sold by Howell Industries.

           profit using the new deal from the supplier.                                                 [3]
