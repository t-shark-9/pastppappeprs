Option A — Vergil

Extract 1 Vergil, Aeneid 12.684–703

1.   (a)   Award [1] up to [4] for any of the following: it hurtles from the top (de vertice
           ruit); it is carried down the steep incline (fertur in abruptum); it leaps across/from the ground
           (exsultat solo); it rolls trees, herds and men with it (silvas armenta virosque involvens
           secum).

     (b)   The ground is drenched in blood (sanguine terra madet) [1] and the air whistles with (the
           sound of) spears (stridunt hastilibus aurae) [1]

     (c)   Award [1] up to [2] for any relevant point of discussion supported by the Latin text; and [1]
           up to [2] for a credible effect such as:

           • Repetition of deserit suggests the urgency of his actions

           • Interlocking word order/synchesis/hyperbaton (deserit et muros et summas deserit arces)
              to emphasize his haste and urgency
           • Epithet (pater Aeneas) emphasizing Aeneas’s sense of duty
           • Polyptoton / repetition (omnis … omnia) emphasizing how Aeneas abandons everything
             except for his pursuit of Turnus
           • Parallel structure (moras omnis, opera omnia) emphasizing how Aeneas abandons
             everything except for his pursuit of Turnus
           • Pleonasm laetitia exsultans to emphasize his joy at the upcoming fight

     (d)   Aeneas is compared to [1] a mountain/Appenninus [1] in his size / how he roars / rejoices /

           extending North to South throughout the entirety of the Italian peninsula.
           Award [1] for a credible effect, such as: the association with an Italian mountain legitimises
           Aeneas’s victory in Italy; the choice of pater Appenninus suggests Aeneas stands out among
           his people like the highest mountain in a range of mountains; as the biggest thing familiar to
           his audience, it conveys the size/impressiveness of Aeneas.

                                                                                                  Total: [15]
