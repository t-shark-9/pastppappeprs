Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   Evaluate the domestic and foreign policies of William I as King of England.


     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the domestic and foreign policies of
     William I by identifying their key aims and judging their success. Domestically the aims were to
     deal with opposition and to establish Norman rule. In foreign policy he aimed to retain control of his
     continental territory and to resist threats to his rule. At his death in 1087 his Continental
     possessions were secure with Robert nominated to succeed him as Duke of Normandy, the Danes
     were no longer a threat but Malcom of Scotland remained one, so some success. Norman rule was
     firmly established, administration was built on pre-existing structures such as the counties and the
     Earls (all Earls were now of Norman descent). Some may discuss the use of force and its
     damaging impact, (‘the harrying of the North”) and quelling unrest in the South West. The
     establishment of a Norman dominated feudal structure accompanied by castle building firmly
     embedded Norman rule, although it was slightly tenuous on the Scottish border. Candidates'
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

2.   Compare and contrast the reigns of Louis VII and Philip II (Philip Augustus).

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the two kings. For comparison, both were keen to extend the royal demesne and were trying to
     reduce the power of their vassals. They also wanted to centralise power in Paris and establish
     effective administration. Both encouraged the construction of great royal buildings such as St
     Denis and Notre Dame to enhance the status of the monarchy. Both participated in a crusade, but
     both returned early. Contrasts are largely confined to the extent of their achievements. Louis VII
     lost territory on the annulment of his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine, whereas Philip gradually
     reduced Angevin power and finally gained Normandy. He also extended French power in the south
     during the Albigensian Crusade. Philip’s administrative reforms were more extensive, reducing the
     power of the barons and gaining the support of the bourgeoisie by granting royal charters to towns.
     He ensured that Henry II and the Count of Flanders paid homage to him. Candidates' opinions and
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   To what extent was religion the most significant reason for Christian opposition to the Muslim
     states in Spain?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that religion was the most
     significant reason for Christian opposition to Muslim states in Spain. Candidates may refer to the
     influence of the Crusades and their ideology in Spain as a motive for Christian hostility. They may
     also consider the importance of the idea of Reconquista, that claimed Christians were entitled to
     rule Spain. Candidates may also argue that the writings of monks and priests strengthened the
     idea that Muslims were dangerous invaders. Candidates may challenge the question arguing that
     opposition to Muslim states was due primarily to political competition for the control of the
     peninsula and the Mediterranean area. The opposition could also be caused by economic factors,
     such as Muslim wealth. Candidates may also point out that there was not only opposition, but also
     collaboration with Muslim states and many helped the Christian kings against their rivals.
     Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

4.   Discuss the impact of the segregation of the Jews from society.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the segregation of the
     Jews from society. Candidates may point out that segregation led to the formation of Jewish
     neighbourhoods, reducing their daily interactions with Muslims and Christians. Segregation also
     limited their opportunities to trade and to carry out a number of economic activities. In some cases,
     the segregation led to the expulsion of Jewish communities. Candidates may also point out that
     segregation had an impact on many royal courts from where Jewish ambassadors, physicians,
     astronomers, writers, and artists were expelled. Segregation also resulted in the loss of
     experienced accountants and tax collectors who worked for Christian monarchs. Candidates may
     challenge the question pointing out that the policies of segregation were not always consistently
     applied. They may also suggest that many Christians were still in contact with Jews regardless of
     the segregation imposed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   “The Hundred Years War had a limited impact on England.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     The question requires that candidates examine the merits or otherwise of the view that that the war
     had a limited impact on England. Some may point out that there was limited impact on the
     population as the size of armies were relatively small and that other events such as the Black
     Death had a greater impact. It could be argued that the war instilled a greater sense of English
     national consciousness, especially after battles such as Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt. The war
     had a serious impact on royal finances which weakened the monarchy and increased the power of
     parliament, especially the Commons whose support was needed for taxation to fund the various
     campaigns. At times the power of the great nobles was increased as their support was required on
     campaigns. Arguably the authority of the monarchy was weakened by military failure (Henry VI)
     and some argue that the causes of the Wars of the Roses had their roots in the final stages of the
     war. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions should be clearly stated and supported with appropriate
     evidence.

6.   Evaluate the contribution of Charles the Bold to the fall of ducal Burgundy.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of Charles the Bold in the
     decline of Burgundian power. Burgundian territory stretched from Charolais to the borders of the
     Netherlands and Charles hoped to establish a Burgundian Kingdom by expanding further. As a
     consequence, he was in conflict at different times with Austria, the Swiss, the Duke of Lorraine and
     Louis XI. Arguably it was his ambitions which led to conflicts and the weakening of Burgundy,
     although it could also be argued that at the time of his death in January 1477 Burgundy was still a
     major power. His daughter Mary married Maximilian of Austria later in the year and Louis XI
     claimed the Duchy of Burgundy. So, alternatively, it could be argued that it was the rivalry with
     Louis XI and his policies that led to decline. Louis frequently made alliances and treaties that would
     weaken Burgundy for example the Treaty of Picquigny with Edward IV which cost Burgundy an
     important ally. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported with
     appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                                       8823 – 5309M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   To what extent did the social and political situation in Florence cause the emergence of the
     Renaissance?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the social and political
     situation in Florence contributed to the emergence of the Renaissance. Candidates may refer to
     the nature of the city-state of Florence and its representative system that recognised people´s
     status by occupation instead of family lineage. Candidates may also consider the role played by
     wealthy families such as the Medici as governors of Florence and their contributions to embellish
     the city. Regarding the social context, candidates may point out that freedom of intellectual life in
     Florence enabled the introduction of new ideas that also contributed to the emergence of the
     Renaissance. Candidates may refer to the role played by important artists congregated in the city,
     many interested in reintroducing elements of classical art and architecture. Candidates may
     challenge the question suggesting that the most relevant factor was that Florence was a trading
     centre on the route from Rome to Venice, allowing the city to import materials, goods and new
     ideas. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

8.   “Patronage was of limited significance to the development of the Renaissance.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that patronage was of
     limited significance for the development of the Renaissance. Candidates may argue that much of
     the extensive work in civil and military engineering, and many of the art works were actually paid
     for by the taxes of the population; nevertheless, the works were initiated by various rulers. They
     may consider the role played by artists and intellectuals who travelled to different cities collecting
     ideas, new styles and techniques as reasons for the development of the Renaissance. Candidates
     may challenge the statement discussing the significant role played by wealthy families, like the
     Medici and Sforza, who invited important artists to their courts and promoted the careers of
     Bramante, Botticelli, Lippi, Perugino, Ghirlandaio, and Da Vinci, among others. They may also
     consider the importance of Papal patronage, responsible for commissioning major works for the
     Church. Candidates may also discuss the role played by a number of guilds in commissioning
     important art works. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                                      8823 – 5309M


Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    “The desire to open trade routes for luxury goods was the most significant motive for exploration.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the desire to open
      trade routes for luxury goods was the most significant motive for exploration. Candidates may refer
      to the importance of luxury goods to establish social status. They may also consider the need for
      precious metals and gems to pay for the luxury goods brought from the east as a motive for the
      exploration. Candidates may challenge the statement arguing that a motive for exploration in
      America was the desire for land on the part of the Conquistadores. Candidates may also argue that
      the need for food and raw materials was much more urgent for most people in Europe. They may
      point out that luxury goods were only acquired by a minority. Other factors could have also
      triggered exploration, such as new scientific developments, especially in astronomy and
      navigation. Candidates’ may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

10.   Evaluate the significance of the exploration of the Indian Ocean for European states.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of the exploration of the Indian Ocean for
      European states. Candidates may point out that the exploration of the Indian Ocean led to
      numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. It also enabled new
      expeditions in the Americas, Asia and Africa such as those commanded by Juan Sebastián del
      Cano and Ferdinand Magellan. Candidates may state that the exploration of the Indian Ocean
      allowed Portugal to acquire the monopoly of the spice trade between Asia and Europe. Candidates
      may also discuss the conflicts between European kingdoms to control trade in the Indian Ocean.
      While other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported
      with appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                                      8823 – 5309M


Section 6: Aspects of the Reformation (c1500–1563)

11.   Discuss the reasons for, and the result of, the Peace of Augsburg (1555).

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and the result of, the
      Peace of Augsburg (1555). As reasons, candidates may refer to Charles V´s unwillingness to
      recognize the religious division in Western Christendom. Charles V established first a provisional
      ruling known as the Augsburg Interim, but in 1552 it was overthrown by the revolt of the Protestant
      elector Maurice of Saxony. In the negotiations at Passau, even Catholic princes called for a lasting
      peace. The Diet determined that no prince in the empire should make war on religious grounds. A
      consequence that candidates may point out is that after the peace only two churches were
      recognized: the Roman Catholic and the Lutheran. Another consequence was the religion of a
      prince was obligatory for his subjects, so a number of communities were relocated. The free
      imperial cities were exceptions and Lutheran and Catholic citizens remained free. The Peace also
      stated that the ecclesiastical lands taken by Lutheran rulers from Catholic prelates remained in
      Lutheran hands. Catholics gained the promise that in the future, if a prince became Protestant he
      should renounce his office, lands, and revenues. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

12.   “The Roman Inquisition played a significant role in strengthening Catholicism after the
      Reformation.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the Roman Inquisition
      played a significant role in strengthening Catholicism after the Reformation. Candidates may argue
      that the Roman Inquisition allowed the Church to impose a stricter control over the already existing
      local inquisition systems in many regions, combatting not only Protestants, but also those Catholics
      considered dangerous or deviants by Rome. Candidates may refer to the creation of the Index of
      Prohibited Books that limited the circulation of Lutheran ideas. They may also discuss the influence
      the Roman Inquisition had over a number of princes and states who withdrew their protection from
      Protestants. Candidates may challenge the statement pointing out that the Roman Inquisition
      caused a number of conflicts within Christendom due to persecutions. The role played by Pope
      Paul III and the Council of Trent in strengthening Catholicism could also be discussed. They may
      also consider the importance of new religious orders, especially the Jesuits, in reconstructing
      church life. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –                                    8823 – 5309M


Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   “Enlightenment ideas had limited political impact.” Discuss with reference to two of the following
      countries: Germany, England, Scotland, France, Spain, Italy.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the political
      impact of Enlightenment ideas in various countries. The political impact will vary according to the
      exemplars chosen, where there has been an impact there should be a clear connection with
      Enlightenment ideas. Many will argue that where the ideas had the most impact was in France.
      Enlightenment ideas were often considered to be a major factor in sparking the demand for political
      change and ultimately revolution. Some may argue that Enlightenment ideas had a tangential
      impact on England as the ideas influenced American resistance to colonial rule. Others may argue
      that Enlightenment ideas had a limited political impact citing Frederick the Great, who wished to be
      seen as an enlightened ruler but who retained his political power. In the case of Scotland there was
      great interest in Enlightenment ideas which had little real political impact. Candidates’ opinions and
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

14.   “The aim of their foreign policy was to increase their power.” Discuss with reference to any two
      absolutist monarchs.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      The chosen exemplars can be from the same state e.g., Louis XIV and Louis XV, they do not have
      to be contemporaries. To agree with the statement responses may refer to Catherine the Great,
      Frederick the Great and Charles XII of Sweden, all of whom conducted foreign policy with the aim
      of acquiring more territory or establishing strong alliances via dynastic marriages. Catherine the
      Great‘s eastern policy was definitely to increase power, influence and trade. Whereas in Europe
      her policy aims were less clear as she often wished to appear as a mediator. To argue against the
      statement there might be reference to Louis XV whose priorities varied. He signed the Treaty of Aix
      -la -Chapelle arguing that France had sufficient territory yet participated in the Seven Years war in
      order to weaken Prussia and protect French colonial possessions. Candidates’ opinions and
      conclusions will be stated clearly and supported with appropriate evidence.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   Evaluate the contribution of Louis XVI to the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of Louis XVI to the
      outbreak of revolution. Many might argue that Louis XVI contributed significantly to the revolution,
      discussing his poor decisions prior to the revolution. He failed to appoint ministers who could deal
      effectively with the financial crisis. He agreed to the election of the Estates General, as well as the
      “doubling of the Third” giving more power to the bourgeois lawyers who sought radical change.
      Louis acknowledged the establishment of the National Assembly. His attempts to sack Necker led
      to the Storming of the Bastille. Others may argue it was the inherently unfair and divisive social and
      political structure (Three Estates) that contributed to discontent which was exacerbated by the poor
      harvest of 1788, leading to the emergence of the “sans culottes” and thus revolution. There may be
      some discussion of Enlightenment ideas which influenced revolutionary leaders such as Danton
      and Robespierre. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported with
      appropriate evidence.

16.   “The Terror was the most significant cause of the Thermidorean reaction.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that the Terror
      was the main cause of the Thermidorean reaction. This was the execution of Robespierre and
      some of his supporters in July 1794. Some may agree that this was directly linked to the Terror.
      Robespierre had mentioned that there were more suspects, and many politicians feared they
      would be next to be guillotined. Others may argue that the events of Thermidor were the result of
      the National Convention reasserting its power over the Committee of Public Safety. Revenge could
      also be seen to be a cause across a wide political spectrum from royalists to Dantonists. Some
      may argue that France’s situation was less critical as the financial crisis was easing, the assignat
      was recovering and food supplies more secure. Internal revolts were crushed and Carnot had won
      the battle of Fleurus. It could be argued there was no longer a need for such a dictatorial regime
      and Robespierre became politically isolated. Different groups such as Catholics and the middle
      classes wanted order and stability. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and
      supported with appropriate evidence.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   Examine the impact of the Congress of Vienna on France.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between France post 1815
      and the Congress of Vienna. Candidates may choose to focus on both France’s international
      status as well as on politics and society within France. One impact was the restoration of the
      Bourbon monarchy, with Louis XVIII recognised as the legitimate King of France. The second
      treaty of Paris 1815 returned France to her 1790 frontiers so there was some loss of territory, an
      occupation for 3-5 years and an indemnity of 700 million Francs was imposed. Arguably there was
      limited impact, by 1818, the occupation had ended, the indemnity paid and France was no longer
      isolated, participating in the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle. Internally there was some political
      instability with the White Terror following the second restoration and the influence of the Ultras
      meant that policies were not always moderate. Arguably some of the problems were a direct
      consequence of the Congress’ focus on legitimacy. Many returning emigres demanded restoration
      or compensation for land seized during the revolution, claiming to be legitimate owners.
      Candidates' opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

18.   Evaluate the factors which enabled Louis-Napoleon to become Emperor by 1851.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the key factors that led to the
      establishment of the Second Empire. Factors to consider could include Louis Napoleon's political
      skills and opportunism, fear of the radical nature of the 1848 revolution outside of Paris and the
      willingness to use force to moderate the revolution (Cavaignac’s repression of radicals). Louis
      Napoleon was able to appeal to a range of opinion; French society was innately conservative. The
      right saw him as a substitute monarch, a strong man, many liked the link to the glory of empire and
      the middle classes saw him as a figure of order and stability. He won the 1849 election with over 5
      million votes and moved to the right (Falloux Laws). Three million poorer voters were
      disenfranchised, but he still could not get an amendment extending his term as Prince President
      and in December 1851 he staged a coup with the backing of the army. Candidates’ opinions and
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 13 –                                   8823 – 5309M


Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Discuss the view that the Great Reform Act of 1832 had a major impact on politics in Britain.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      1832 Reform Act on politics. In agreement candidates may argue that the worst abuses such as
      Rotten Boroughs had been removed. Major cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Leeds
      now had representation and 140 seats came up for redistribution, giving more seats to Scotland
      and Ireland. Voters had to register, thus starting the process of constituency parties emerging. To
      disagree, politics were still very much dominated by the south of England with 370 MPs
      representing southern and midland regions. There were still 50 Pocket Boroughs where
      landowners had control, as there was no secret ballot. In parliament the influence of wealthy
      landowners was predominant as many businessmen were unwilling to take on the unpaid role of
      MP. It could be argued that the major impact was that the 1832 Act began a process of
      evolutionary change that eventually led to full democracy in the 20th century. Candidates’ opinions
      and conclusions will be stated clearly and supported with appropriate evidence.

20.   To what extent were Salisbury’s domestic and Irish policies successful?

      The question requires that candidates make a considered judgement regarding Salisbury’s
      domestic and Irish policies. In judging success, responses may point out that Salisbury considered
      it was the task of government to facilitate individual freedom and opportunities for self-help. Many
      of his policies were well meaning but lacked an element of compulsion and had little impact, such
      as the Labourers Allotment Act 1887. Others were more effective, such as the Mines Regulation
      Act and the 1891 Factory Act. Arguably his most successful policies were in education and Local
      Government. The Fee Grant Act ensured more children received elementary education. In 1888,
      62 County Councils were established with wide ranging powers. Policies in Ireland varied, Balfour’s
      Crimes Act 1887, increased tensions whereas the Land Purchase Act enabled tenants to buy their
      own land. The Congested Districts Act introduced training schemes and improved infrastructure. At
      no point did Salisbury attempt to address the underlying problems of poverty in British society,
      believing this was best solved by individual self-help. Although there was some reform in Ireland,
      he was firmly opposed to Irish Home Rule. Candidates' opinions and conclusions will be clearly
      stated and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 14 –                                   8823 – 5309M


Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   Discuss the impact of Austrian dominance on the emergence of Italian nationalism up to 1849.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered review of the relationship between
      Austrian dominance and the growth of Italian nationalism. There may be some description of the
      extent of Austrian control: there was direct rule in Venetia and Lombardy and indirect rule in the
      Central Duchies. Austrian troops could also be relied upon to repress rebellions e.g., in Naples
      1821 and the Central Duchies 1831-32. They were thus perceived as a reactionary force. This
      image contributed to the rise of groups such as the Adelfia and Carbonari who were quite radical
      politically. Similarly, Mazzini’s Young Italy movement wanted political change and the removal of
      the Austrians was essential to achieve this. It was the defeat of Piedmont in 1849 and the crushing
      of revolutions elsewhere in Italy both by Austria that made Italian nationalists aware of the need for
      more coherent policies. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported
      with appropriate evidence.

22.   “The economic strength of Prussia was the most significant factor leading to the unification of
      Germany in 1871.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the factors which
      led to German unification. To agree with the statement, it could be argued that from the
      establishment of the Zollverein many German states were linked economically to Prussia, thus
      they were more willing to accept unification. Some may point out that Prussia’s economic strength
      allowed her to afford Moltke’s military reforms and win the wars of unification. Others may argue
      that it was the political skill of Bismarck that facilitated unification. He manipulated opportunities
      presented by the Schleswig-Holstein question to weaken and defeat Austria. He used a
      combination of diplomacy and opportunism to play on the fears of the South German states, using
      the Hohenzollern Candidature to provoke France into war. He took advantage of the fact that none
      of the major powers were willing or able to resist Prussia's increasing power. Some may argue that
      it was a relatively equal combination of economic strength, Bismarck’s skills and military success
      that led to unification. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

23.   Discuss the view that the reforms of Alexander II had more failures than successes.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reforms of
      Alexander II. The Emancipation Edict 1861 freed serfs but tied them to the Mir and imposed
      Redemption Dues payable over 49 years. This resulted in “economic slavery”, peasants were
      worse off, with poor quality land to farm. Local government reforms were partially successful
      because the Zemstva and Duma improved local administration. They were however dominated by
      the wealthy and the nobility. Judicial reforms introduced the concept of equality before the law, an
      independent judiciary and trial by jury which were major improvements. However special courts for
      political crimes were retained. Education reform gave more freedom (temporarily) to universities
      and access to secondary and primary education was expanded; however, illiteracy was still a
      major problem. Military reforms were among the most successful, Milyutin reformed the command
      structure of the Army and ended the 25-year period of service. All adult males had to serve for 6
      years. The army was better trained and more effective as could been seen in the Russo-Turkish
      war. It could be argued that the reforms were in fact limited or unsuccessful in most areas.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be stated clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

24.   “The main aim of Lenin’s foreign policy was to spread revolution.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Lenin
      pursued revolution via his foreign policies. To agree with the statement there may be some
      discussion of the Russo-Polish War and the establishment of Comintern to support foreign
      communist parties as evidence of his desire to spread revolution. Others may point out that Lenin’s
      foreign policy was a response to the weakness of the Soviet Union. The treaties of Brest –Litovsk
      and Riga were both a consequence of military weakness. The normalisation of relations with
      Britain and Germany and subsequent trade agreements were necessary to help restore the
      economy. Some may argue that the treaty of Rapallo ensured that there would be no united front
      against the Soviet Union. Some may point out that in the short-term, Lenin pursued practical
      policies that aided the survival of the communist regime but that ultimately, he still wished for world
      revolution. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   “Imperial expansion in Africa and Asia had a limited impact on European diplomacy.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that imperial expansion in Africa
      and Asia had a limited impact on European diplomacy. Candidates may argue that European
      diplomacy was mainly affected by European tensions, and that European diplomacy was
      influenced by the treaties among other European countries, rather than their ambitions in other
      regions of the world. The issues around the Partition of Africa were resolved to some extent by the
      Conference of Berlin. In Asia, there was some collaboration between European powers, e.g., over
      the Boxer Rebellion. Candidates may challenge the question, arguing that imperialism affected
      European diplomacy since it bolstered nationalism. Candidates may discuss the diplomatic impact
      of events such as the Fashoda Incident, the Second Boer war and the Moroccan crises. To support
      the statement, candidates may argue that events in the Balkans and elsewhere in Europe had a
      much greater impact on European diplomacy. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence and sound argument.

26.   Evaluate the impact of German foreign policy on relations between European nations in the years
      1890 to 1914.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of German foreign policy on relations between
      European nations in the years 1890 to 1914. Candidates may discuss the impact of the changes
      introduced after abandoning Bismarck’s foreign policy, the dropping of the Reinsurance Treaty with
      Russia and the ineffective overtures to Britain. Candidates may also consider the role played by
      von Tirpitz, naval adviser of William II, who sought to make Germany a global power. These
      attempts threatened the British who negotiated an alliance with France (Entente Cordiale) and
      settled its differences with Russia resulting in the Triple Entente 1907. Candidates may refer to the
      Kruger Telegram, German support for Austria-Hungary over the Bosnian Crisis in 1908, the
      Moroccan Crises and the Blank Cheque in 1914 as examples of German foreign policy which all
      hardened division within Europe. Candidates may evaluate other factors that had an impact on
      relations between European nations such as imperial competition in Africa and the arms race.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 14: Inter-war domestic developments in European states (1918–1939)

27.   To what extent did Weimar Germany experience a “Golden Era” between 1924 and 1929?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the view that Weimar Germany experienced a
      “Golden Era” between 1924 and 1929. Candidates may refer to the fact that there was a majority of
      moderate, pro-democracy parties in the Reichstag to support the Weimar Republic, there was an
      increase in votes for pro republican parties. The government called off passive resistance,
      regained control of the Ruhr and introduced a new currency, the Rentenmark. Candidates may
      also refer to policies to reform the German Reichsbank to end hyperinflation. The Dawes Plan
      gave Germany more time to pay reparations and agreed a loan of 800 million gold marks, which
      kick-started the German economy. Between 1924 and 1929 there was falling unemployment,
      although there was over a million still unemployed. There was an increase in industrial production,
      but problems remained in agriculture. Economic recovery was fragile as it was largely reliant on
      foreign loans, (“dancing on the edge of a volcano”). There was some political stability, but the
      Communists were still a potential threat and there was Nationalist opposition as the Treaty of
      Versailles was still in place. Some candidates may argue that the “Golden Era” was more of a
      social and cultural phenomenon. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

28.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Mussolini's economic policies up to 1939.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the successes and failures of Mussolini's economic policies
      up to 1939. As successes, candidates may refer to the role played by the Italian Industrial Finance
      Institute and the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction in providing capital, trained managers and
      financial supervision for industrial investment. They may also discuss the modernization of
      infrastructure, and the rise of modern industries in sectors such as chemicals and synthetic fibres.
      Candidates may also mention the reclamation of land due to the draining of the Pontine marshes.
      As failures, candidates may discuss the impact of agricultural policies (Battle for Grain). Another
      failure which could be discussed is the Battle for the Lira which increased the cost of Italian
      exports. They may also argue that although key industries expanded, their markets were domestic
      and dependent on cheap raw material imports. Attempts to achieve autarky generated budget
      deficits and increased taxation. As a consequence, unemployment rose and wages were frozen.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 15: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   To what extent did the treaties of Versailles and St Germain achieve the aims of the peacemakers?

      The question requires that candidates consider whether the two treaties were successful in
      achieving the aims of the statesmen in Paris. Their aims could be, to define European borders to
      ensure peace and stability and where possible adhere to the notion of national self-determination.
      Arguably, the principle of national self-determination was not followed, both treaties stated that
      Austria and Germany were not to integrate and there was a large German minority in the
      Sudetenland. The overarching aim of the treaties was to ensure peace in Europe and the
      imposition of reparations contributed to tensions between European states over the next few years,
      for example in the Ruhr in 1923. In the case of Austria some argued that the new republic should
      not be treated as an aggressor nation and was therefore not liable to pay reparations. Territorial
      changes meant that both Germany and Austria lost industrial areas which would hamper recovery.
      In both cases it could be argued that resentment of the treaties meant that both were revisionist
      states who constantly sought to change the peace treaties. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions
      will be clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

30.   Examine the importance of the wartime alliance (1941–1945) to the development of the Second
      World War in Europe.

      The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between the wartime alliance
      and the course of the Second World War. The alliance was initially between Britain and the Soviet
      Union and expanded to include the US in December 1941. The Axis powers faced the combined
      resources of the US, the Soviet Union and Britain and her empire. The supplies sent to the Soviet
      Union via Murmansk and Archangel, combined with Soviet industrial capacity helped prevent a
      German victory. The Eastern front was a constant drain on Hitler’s resources. US entry was
      particularly significant, with US troops and supplies making an offensive war possible. The US
      produced 70,000 tanks and 120,000 aircraft a year and US forces were important in campaigns
      such as Operation Torch, the invasion of Italy in 1943 and the D-Day landings. Arguably the
      wartime alliance was a key factor in the defeat of Nazi Germany. Some may argue that mistakes
      by Hitler and the weakness of his allies in Europe, particularly Italy also had a major impact on the
      development of the war. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be stated clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   To what extent did propaganda contribute to Stalin’s maintenance of power between 1929 and
      1941?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that propaganda contributed to
      Stalin’s maintenance of power between 1929 and 1941. Candidates may refer to the cult of
      personality that depicted Stalin as the great father of the Soviet Union. In order to access the mass
      of the population, wall posters with bold, simple designs were widely used, often depicting Stalin´s
      triumphs. Films were a tool for propaganda under Stalin. Propaganda made use of stereotypes to
      portray bourgeois culture while Stalin posed as one of the common people. Also, atheistic
      propaganda was pushed in an attempt to obliterate religion. Candidates may point out that
      propaganda was closely linked to education evaluating the role played by schools and Communist
      Youth organizations (like Young Pioneers and Komsomol) that served to indoctrinate children.
      Candidates may challenge the question arguing that economic achievements under Stalin as well
      as his control of the Party were more important in maintaining power. They should also discuss the
      role of repression and the Terror as factors in his preservation of power. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

32.   Discuss the political challenges faced by post-Soviet Russia up to 2000.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the political challenges faced by post-
      Soviet Russia up to 2000. Candidates may refer to Gorbachev´s weak control of the reform
      processes that led to the collapse of the Communist rule. Candidates may also consider the
      challenges faced after becoming independent when Russia, together with Ukraine and Belarus,
      formed the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the difficulties faced by Prime Minister
      Yegor Gaidar. Candidates may discuss the administration of Yeltsin who sent troops to seize
      parliament from opponents of his rule, and the impact of the new constitution of 1993 that gave the
      president extra powers. Candidates may refer to the rebirth of the Communist Party, and the
      political challenges posed by the rebellions in Chechnya that forced President Yeltsin to appoint an
      ex-KGB officer Putin, as prime minister. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Kohl´s policies up to the end of 1990.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the successes and failures of Kohl´s policies up to the end of
      1990. As successes, candidates may refer to Kohl’s early policies that included modest cuts in
      government spending and strong support for West German commitment to NATO. Kohl also led
      the drive for the reunification of Germany and campaigned for the CDU’s sister parties in East
      Germany. In May 1990 Kohl concluded a treaty that unified the two countries’ economic and social-
      welfare systems and established exchange rates between the East German mark and the
      Deutschmark. Candidates may also point out that Kohl strengthened the ties between Germany
      and the United States. He was successful in persuading the Soviet Union during 1990 to accept
      German reunification. As failures, candidates may argue that the absorption of the East German
      economy would prove to be expensive. After this, Kohl had to commit to tax increases and cuts in
      government spending to finance unification. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the
      bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

34.   Evaluate the extent of social and economic change in one western or northern European country
      (other than France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain) between 1945 and 2000.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the extent of social and economic change in one western or
      northern European country (other than France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Spain)
      between 1945 and 2000. This question may allow candidates to discuss their own national history.
      Exemplar countries could include the Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, Ireland, Portugal, Italy,
      Austria or Switzerland. Social changes discussed could include the role of women, the introduction
      of welfare support in some states, expansion of educational opportunities and the development of
      state health provision. Economic change could include migration from the countryside to the cities,
      increased industrialization, levels of unemployment/inflation and the role of trade unions in the
      economy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be clearly expressed and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Discuss the view that Tito’s leadership was the main reason for Yugoslavia’s successful challenge
      to Soviet control.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that Tito’s leadership was the
      main reason for Yugoslavia’s successful resistance to Soviet dominance. Candidates may discuss
      the role played by Tito after the Soviet army liberated Serbia, when he was able to secure a
      proviso that the Soviets would leave Yugoslavia. Tito focused on remaining independent of both
      the Soviet Union and the Western powers. He created a “second Yugoslavia,” a socialist federation
      that became known for its non-aligned stance, and that was not part of the Warsaw Pact nor
      Cominform. Candidates may point out that Tito also received military and economic aid from the
      US president Harry Truman. Economically Tito allowed full trade with the West. They may also
      point out his decision to allow cultural and scientific freedom, contributed to his popularity.
      Candidates may challenge the statement evaluating the role played by the Yugoslav People’s
      Army (YPA) that adopted during the Cold War, a strategy of “Total National Defence” against
      possible invasion by the Soviet bloc. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

36.   “Ethnic disputes were the main cause of the Balkan conflicts in the 1990s.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that ethnic
      disputes were the main cause of the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s. Candidates may
      discuss the importance of the ethnic-religious factors since Muslims made up more than
      two-fifths of the Bosnian population, while Serbs made up slightly less than one-third and
      Croats one-sixth. They may point out that ethnic tensions re-emerged with the growth of
      nationalist groups leading to the declarations of independence in Croatia and Slovenia.
      Candidates may also consider the role played by nationalistic leaders like Karadzic,
      Mladic, and Milosevic who supported ethnic cleansings. Candidates may challenge the
      statement arguing that the decline of the Yugoslav economy from the 1980s onwards led
      to widespread public dissatisfaction. They may also consider as reasons for the conflict,
      the impact of numerous independent political parties that appeared after 1989 that were
      unable to cooperate. Candidates may also mention the failed attempts by the European
      Union to promote a new division of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
