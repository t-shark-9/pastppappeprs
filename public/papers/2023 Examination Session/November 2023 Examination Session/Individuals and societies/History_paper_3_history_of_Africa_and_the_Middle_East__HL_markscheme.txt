Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed
but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or
significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks
allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be
rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   “Centralized government was the most important reason for ‘Abbasid economic success.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that centralized government was the most important reason for Abbasid economic success.
     Candidates may discuss ways in which the establishment of a centralized government led to the
     creation of effective financial, legal and communications systems, which aided commerce as well
     as the peace and security of the Empire. Powerful viziers exercised tight control over provincial
     governors and the civil service was extensive and cohesive, bringing in revenues for the treasury
     through a range of taxes. The expansion of the Empire and its extensive diplomatic contacts
     provided new markets and materials for the economy. Candidates may discuss other relevant
     factors: the advancement of science and technology which helped expand commercial
     opportunities; the continued growth of the Empire which enabled merchants to establish markets in
     Africa and Asia; the social status of merchants in the Islamic world which encouraged them to
     continue their efforts to develop the economy. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the
     bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly
     agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.

2.   “Religious conflict was the main reason for the breakdown of ‘Abbasid authority.” To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that religious conflict was the
     main reason for the decline of Abbasid authority. Candidates may refer to religious conflict with the
     Umayyads and the Fatimids which caused a loss of Abbasid power. Other sectarian groups
     engaged in periodic uprisings which further weakened Abbasid authority. Internal struggles
     between the Shi’a and Sunni factions caused internal dissension and political factionalism. Attacks
     from Christian forces such as the Crusaders and Byzantines further weakened Abbasid power.
     Other factors in the breakdown of Abbasid authority which may be addressed include: the size of
     the Empire and its cultural diversity, which made control difficult; the decline of dynastic authority in
     the 9th century and the financial weakness caused by excess and corruption, which undermined
     the central authority; the rise of powerful military groups such as the Seljuks which resulted in the
     drastic reduction of Abbasid authority. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of
     the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree
     or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.
                                                  –5–                                      8823 – 5306M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   Discuss the reasons why the Fatimids failed to successfully claim the Caliphate.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why the Fatimid dynasty
     failed to successfully establish a claim to the Caliphate. Reasons may predate the timeframe but
     they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the fact that
     the Fatimid claim came at a time when their military power was declining; they faced challenges
     from the Umayyad dynasty which was seizing their territory. Their Ismaili doctrine was not
     accepted by the majority of the Islamic world, which made their claim to the Caliphate unpopular.
     Their religious position was further weakened by sectarian divisions within the Ismaili community
     which lessened their credibility as the leader of Islam. Candidates may also discuss the emergence
     of powerful rivals such as the Seljuks, who had arisen to claim the Caliphate and sought to
     suppress the Fatimids. The political and racial divisions and conflicts within the Fatimid Empire
     made them less able to exert their authority. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the
     bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question, and candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

4.   Evaluate the impact of institutions of learning on the Fatimid Empire.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of institutions of learning on
     the Fatimid Empire, weighing up their strengths and limitations. Consequences may extend beyond
     the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to strengths such as the establishment of academic institutions such as Al-Azhar and Dar-al-lim,
     which added to Fatimid prestige in the Islamic world and supported their claim to be its leader. The
     institutions attracted scholars from all countries and faiths. This caused Cairo to replace Baghdad
     as the intellectual centre of Islam, positioning the Fatimid Empire at the cultural heart of the Muslim
     world. Foreign scholars expanded diplomatic relations and promoted commercial activity, thus
     enhancing trade across the region and contributing to the economic success of the Fatimids. The
     institutions of learning trained many Ismaili missionaries and contributed to the strengthening of
     Fatimid government by training skilled administrators. Limitations may include the sectarian nature
     of education in academic institutions, which occasionally led to revolts against the Fatimids.
     Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be clearly presented and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   “Secular motives were the main reason for involvement in the First Crusade.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that secular motives were
     the main reason for involvement in the First Crusade. Reasons may predate the timeframe but
     must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the fact that the
     Crusades offered participants the chance to acquire land, titles, material wealth and an enhanced
     reputation. Crusaders were forgiven their debts and would have a chance to display their military
     skills, participate in a grand adventure and escape problems in Europe. The merchants and
     mercantile towns joined the Crusading movement for great commercial opportunity through
     charges for equipment, transportation and the chance to gain trade rights. Other factors may be
     discussed: the religious tradition of pilgrimage was a strong inducement, as was the chance of
     obtaining salvation through a papal grant of absolution for participants. Another religious motive
     was the papal desire to support the Orthodox Church and repair the Great Schism of 1054. While
     other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
     in the question. Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     relevant evidence.

6.   Discuss the view that Islamic military power was the main reason for the failure of the Crusades.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that Islamic military power was
     the main reason for the failure of the Crusades. Causes may predate the time frame but must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the increased size and
     improved tactical skills of the Islamic forces, such as in siege warfare. The emergence of superior
     military leaders such as Saladin and Baibars gave them a further advantage. The morale of the
     armed forces was very high as a result of victories. Other relevant factors may be discussed: the
     declining support for the Crusading movement which reduced the size of their armies and morale;
     the poor quality of Christian leadership as shown in the Second, Third and Fourth Crusades, which
     resulted in numerous defeats and further loss of support. Failure to co-operate with the Byzantine
     Empire was another reason for failure. The political unity of the Islamic world was a further source
     of their strength. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
     remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be clearly
     presented and supported by relevant evidence.
                                                   –7–                                      8823 – 5306M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   To what extent was the contest between the Ottomans and the Safavids caused by religious
     differences?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the contest between the
     Ottomans and the Safavids was the result of religious differences. Causes may predate the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the Ottomans, who were the leaders of Sunni Islam, while the Safavids supported the Shi'ites.
     This competition for the leadership of Islam led to conflict. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, including the Safavid presence in Iran which posed a threat to Ottoman borders. The
     Safavids were of Turkish origin and had many supporters inside the Ottoman Empire, which made
     them a strategic and religious threat. The Ottoman sultan, Selim I, was an aggressive individual
     who sought to crush any potential sources of opposition. The Safavids were seen as a distraction
     to the strategic goal of expanding into the Middle East and Europe, and as such they had to be
     eliminated. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
     on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence and sound argument.

8.   Discuss the view that the Ottoman Empire made few changes to the Islamic world.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that the Ottoman Empire made
     few changes to the Islamic world. The consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they
     must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the fact that the
     Ottomans continued administrative and government forms established by the Abbasids. They did
     not interfere significantly with local customs or replace local officials in conquered areas, as long as
     taxes were paid and no opposition arose. Candidates may discuss changes such as the new legal
     codes introduced during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, and the expansion of the presence
     and privileges of non-Muslims. Some cultural changes took place as the Ottomans promoted
     Persian as a language of culture and supported the Sufi sects within Sunni Islam. The
     establishment of Istanbul as the capital increased the power and prestige of Islam and made it the
     economic and intellectual capital of the Western world. The greatest change to the Islamic world
     was its expansion under the Ottomans and its development of diplomatic relations with Europe and
     the recognition of the Empire as a world power. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    “The main impact of trans-Saharan trade was the Islamization of West Africa.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the main impact of trans-
      Saharan trade was the Islamization of West Africa. Consequences may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to the role of Muslim traders from North Africa, who sought to convert West Africans to their faith.
      Traders in the Ghana Empire preferred to deal with fellow Muslims, and while the empire itself was
      not Islamic, Muslim converts were involved in its administration. Mansa Musa made Islam the state
      religion of his Mali Empire, while other polities in the region such as Songhai and the Hausa city
      states were also Islamic. Candidates may disagree with the statement by arguing that the main
      impact of trade was not the spread of Islam but the rise of great empires. Additionally, Islamization
      was limited due to many in the region continuing to follow traditional belief systems. While other,
      relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

10.   Evaluate the importance of economic organization to the rise and expansion of the Kingdom of the
      Kongo.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of economic organisation to the rise and
      expansion of the Kingdom of the Kongo, weighing up its significance or otherwise. Candidates may
      refer to ways in which the growth of the kingdom was fuelled by the trade in slaves and ivory, with
      the Congo River connecting it to the continental interior. A sophisticated regional economy resulted
      with the capital, Mbanza Kongo, emerging as a centre of trade. Artisanal goods such as copper
      ware, cloth and pottery were produced, and the expansion of the capital stimulated food production
      in the countryside. Candidates may look at ways in which economic activity was promoted by the
      use of the nzimbu shell as a currency, and how the state was able to raise revenue through an
      effective system of taxation. Candidates may consider limitations such as the role of non-economic
      factors on the rise and expansion of the kingdom. These may include leadership, political
      organisation and the introduction of the Catholic faith. Both importance and limitations must be
      clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other, relevant,
      factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                   –9–                                      8823 – 5306M


      Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   Compare and contrast the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate and the rise of the Mahdist state in Sudan.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the Sokoto Caliphate
      and the Mahdist state in terms of their rise, referring to both throughout. Factors identified may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. For
      comparison, candidates may note the importance of charismatic leadership and religion, with
      Usman Dan Fodio using jihad to conquer the Hausa states while Mohammed Ahmed led a
      religious rebellion against Egyptian rule in Sudan. Each used economic factors to win support:
      Usman was backed by poor peasant pastoralists while the Mahdi was supported by merchants
      whose trade had been suppressed. For contrast, candidates may focus on political structure:
      Usman built a loosely federated Caliphate, while the Mahdi’s successors tried to create a more
      centralised state. The rise of the Caliphate was boosted by the emergence of a strong market-
      based economy, while the economy of Sudan declined following the death of Mohammed Ahmed.
      The Sokoto Caliphate inspired other jihads and enjoyed good relations with its neighbours, while
      the Mahdist state fought wars against Ethiopia and was invaded by the British. Both similarities and
      differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.

12.   “The most important factor in the rise of African states was political.” Discuss with reference to two
      of the following: the Mandinka Empire under Samori Toure; the Lozi kingdom under Lewanika; the
      Ndebele kingdom under Mziklikazi and Lobengula; the Asante empire under Osei Tutu; the
      Nyamwezi under Mirambo; the Hehe state under Mkwawa.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the most important
      factor in the rise of African states was political, with reference to two of the named states. Factors
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may discuss the personality and leadership ability of the named individuals in the
      question. They may consider the role of military organisation and conquest of neighbouring states,
      as well as use of diplomacy and persuasion in allowing states to achieve ascendancy in their
      region. They may also discuss the success of leaders in responding to external threats. This may
      include the use of strategies of resistance and/or collaboration in combatting the threat of
      colonisation. Candidates may disagree with the statement by considering other factors in the rise
      of African states, including economic structure, success in trade, religion, and traditional cultural
      practices and belief systems. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   “The main impact of the slave trade on Africa was loss of population.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the main impact of
      the slave trade on Africa was loss of population. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe
      but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the loss of
      many millions due to the Atlantic and East African trades, and the long-term economic
      consequences of demographic decline. Those taken were typically young adults who were healthy
      and productive. Others who avoided capture were reluctant to engage in agricultural activity for
      fear of enslavement. Candidates may discuss other impacts, such as the legacy of warfare among
      African groups due to slaving raids, as well as the break-up of powerful states which were
      destabilised by the trade. They may argue that the later colonisation of the continent was facilitated
      by this fragmentation, by the enormous wealth that accrued to Europe due to the trade, and by the
      racist attitudes which accompanied it. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree
      or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

14.   Compare and contrast the reasons for the decline of the Atlantic slave trade and the East African
      slave trade.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the reasons for the
      decline of the Atlantic and East African slave trades, referring to both throughout. For compare,
      candidates may refer to the importance of moral condemnation in the decline of both trades. The
      emergence of an abolitionist movement in Britain contributed to the 1807 Slave Trade Act and the
      decline of the Atlantic trade, while missionary explorers like Livingstone were at the forefront of the
      movement to end the East African trade. Similarly, laws such as the 1807 Act and the 1833
      Abolition of Slavery Act, and the enforcement of these laws by the Royal Navy, were key to the
      decline of both trades. For contrast, candidates may note that the collapse of the East African trade
      was sudden, with the closing of the markets in Zanzibar in 1873 proving a decisive factor, while the
      decline of the Atlantic trade was more drawn out, and due largely to economic and technological
      changes which over time reduced the demand for slaves in the Caribbean. Both similarities and
      differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.

Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   “The main economic cause of the partition of Africa was Europe’s need for raw materials.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the main economic
      cause of the partition of Africa was Europe’s need for raw materials. Causes may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      discuss factors such as European demand for West African raw materials like ground nuts and
      cocoa, but especially palm oil. King Leopold’s interest in the Congo, with its abundance of ivory
      and rubber, was another stimulus to partition. Other areas were similarly desired for their
      commodities: Egypt for its cotton, and Southern Africa for minerals, where commercial chartered
      companies played a role in the partition. Candidates may disagree with the statement by
      discussing other economic causes of the partition, such as the need for new markets and outlets
      for investment of surplus capital. They may also note that even after the partition, most raw
      materials imported by European powers were sourced from outside Africa. While other, relevant,
      factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

16.   Examine the impact of British concerns over the sea route to the east on the partition of Africa.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between British concerns over the sea route to the
      East and the partition of Africa. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the argument that a major cause
      of the partition was Britain’s seizure of territory in Africa in order to secure strategic points on the
      sea routes to its empire in India, and the response of other European powers to these moves.
      Britain took the Cape from the Dutch in 1806 and attempted to federate all of South Africa later in
      the century. Candidates may also consider Anglo-French rivalry in Egypt. This resulted from the
      construction of the Suez Canal, which opened up a shorter sea route to the East. French anger at
      the British military occupation of Egypt caused the breakdown of the “gentlemen’s agreement” in
      West Africa, precipitating more colonisation in that region. Similarly, British concerns over the
      activity of German explorers in East Africa, and its fear that its rival might seize the headwaters of
      the Nile and threaten its rule over Egypt, led it to firm up its position in Uganda. While other,
      relevant, interrelationships may be considered, the bulk of the response will remain on those raised
      in the question.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   Examine the significance of political and economic factors to Menelik II’s successful resistance to
      imperialism.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between political and economic factors and Menelik
      II’s success in resisting imperialism. Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and
      economic factors, or they may prioritize their examination of either. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to Menelik’s success in winning the support of other
      princes in the region. This allowed him to send out a huge army to meet the Italians at Adwa. His
      diplomatic prowess led to the Treaties of Wuchale and Addis Ababa with Italy, while an Anglo-
      Ethiopian Treaty demarcated frontiers that were favourable to the Ethiopians. The founding of
      Addis Ababa as a permanent capital in 1887 was another key moment in establishing Ethiopia as a
      modern state capable of resisting colonisation. Candidates may note that success in trade allowed
      Menelik to import firearms, while he used economic incentives such as railway concessions to
      improve relations with other powers such as France and Russia. While other, relevant,
      interrelationships may be considered, such as the significance of military factors to the success of
      resistance, the bulk of the response will remain on those raised in the question.

18.   Evaluate the effectiveness of Kabaka Mwanga and Apolo Kagwa’s responses to the threat of
      European imperialism.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of Kabaka Mwanga and Apolo Kagwa’s
      responses to the threat of European imperialism, weighing up the strengths and limitations of the
      response of each leader. Factors may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two or they may
      prioritize their evaluation of either. However, both rulers will be a feature of the response. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may evaluate Mwanga’s response to
      the presence of European missionaries: his decision to execute converts led to intervention and
      defeat by the British. They may argue that Mwanga then achieved some success by ceding partial
      sovereignty to the British East Africa Company in order to regain his crown. He signed treaties with
      Lugard, but then changed his mind and declared war on Britain, leading to defeat and exile in
      1898. Candidates may argue that Apolo Kagwa’s strategy of collaboration was more effective. He
      negotiated the Uganda Treaty, making Buganda a British protectorate but winning a privileged
      position for his community within the new colonial order. Both strengths and limitations must be
      clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Evaluate the impact of British economic and social policies in Kenya

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of British economic and social policies in Kenya,
      weighing up their success or otherwise. Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and
      social policies, or they may prioritize their evaluation of either. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the construction of the Uganda railway, which
      encouraged economic activity in the interior and made European settlement viable. They may note
      the government’s encouragement of a cash-crop economy based on the production of tea and
      coffee, but argue that it failed to promote industry or otherwise develop a more diversified
      economy. Social policies included encouraging European migration to the White Highlands;
      however, this led to the expropriation of Kikuyu land and a major squatter problem, both of which
      were factors that contributed to the Mau Mau uprising. Some education was provided for Africans
      but it was mostly vocational and of limited quality, and traditional cultural practices were
      suppressed. Both success and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be
      an equal focus on each. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question.

20.   Evaluate the impact of French colonial rule in Senegal.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of French colonial rule in Senegal, weighing up its
      strengths and limitations. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to economic development in the colony,
      which focusing on peasant production of cash crops for export. However, the majority of
      Senegalese remained poor. There was an attempt to develop infrastructure, especially roads and
      railways, with limited provision of education and health facilities. Candidates may emphasise the
      positive impact of some political policies, such as the policy of assimilationist policy which was
      followed in the Four Communes. However, this was not extended to other areas of West Africa,
      and the tenor of colonial rule remained largely racist. Later, moderate nationalism was encouraged,
      with Africans permitted to sit in the National Assembly, and constitutional reforms following the
      Second War granted limited self-rule and universal suffrage to Senegal. Candidates may refer to
      the French attempt to create a new West African Community, the failure of which led to full
      independence in 1960. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not
      need to be an equal focus on each.
                                                  – 14 –                                    8823 – 5306M


Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Evaluate the significance of internal and external factors to the achievement of independence in
      Angola.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of internal and external factors to the
      achievement of independence in Angola, weighing up the importance or otherwise of each.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of internal and external factors, or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      evaluate the significance of internal factors such as the racist policies of the colonial government,
      which grew as a result of the expansion of the white settler community after 1945 and which
      contributed to the growth of African nationalism and the outbreak of liberation war. They may also
      consider the importance of ethnic factors in the emergence of nationalist movements which fought
      for liberation, and the role of leaders, as well as labour disputes such as the Baixa de Cassanje
      revolt. For external factors, candidates may examine the support of newly-independent African
      states which offered cross-border military bases to nationalist groups, as well as the support of
      rival superpowers of the three nationalist parties. The significance of the Carnation Revolution in
      Portugal may also be considered. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

22.   Compare and contrast the contributions to independence of Nkrumah in the Gold Coast and
      Nyerere in Tanganyika.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the contributions to
      independence of Nkrumah in the Gold Coast and Nyerere in Tanganyika, referring to both
      throughout. For compare, candidates may refer to the two leaders’ charisma and dominance of
      their respective nationalist movements: the Convention People’s Party in the Gold Coast and the
      Tanganyika African National Union in Tanganyika. Both were on the political left, yet each was able
      to persuade Britain that its interests would be best served by a swift handover of power to Africans.
      Each enjoyed a good relationship with colonial administrators - Nkrumah with Lyttleton, Nyerere
      with Turnbull - and used this influence to urge constitutional reforms accelerating the move to
      independence. For contrast, candidates may note that Nyerere was viewed as a relatively
      moderate, unlike Nkrumah, who spent time in jail following the Positive Action Campaign.
      Nkrumah, unlike Nyerere, had to win over the intransigence of traditional authorities, and had
      bigger obstacles to overcome due to the Gold Coast being the first African country to achieve
      independence. Contrastingly, Nyerere benefited from Tanganyika’s status as a UN Trust Territory.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each.
                                                  – 15 –                                   8823 – 5306M


Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   Evaluate the impact of Muhammad Ali’s challenge to Ottoman power.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of Muhammad Ali’s challenge to Ottoman power, weighing up
      its importance or otherwise. Candidates may argue that Muhammed Ali’s challenge to Ottoman
      power was significant by stressing ways in which he gained military strength through
      modernization. This influenced the Ottomans to begin improving their own military. Ali's rise to
      power showed the Ottomans their weakness, to the point that they needed allies to defend their
      Empire. Ali conquered Syria and threatened Istanbul, forcing the sultan into an alliance with
      Russia, a remarkable diplomatic development. Ali's power also forced the sultan into a treaty with
      Western powers which gave them the commercial domination of the Empire and crippled the
      Empire’s finances with long-term consequences. Candidates may argue that the most significant
      impact was that Egypt became an independent state, resulting in a major loss of territory, wealth
      and prestige for the Empire. This encouraged other regions to seek independence. They may
      argue that the impact of Ali’s challenge was limited, as the Empire was already in a significant state
      of decline even prior to his emergence. Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

24.   Examine the importance of the First World War to the rise of Ataturk.

      Candidates will consider the inter-relationship between the First World War and the rise of Ataturk.
      Candidates may examine Ataturk’s status as a nationalist leader prior to 1914; however, Gallipoli
      made him a national hero and respected soldier. The Turkish defeat led to the sultan signing the
      Treaty of Sevres which created great resentment amongst Turkish nationalists, who looked for a
      leader for the resistance. In addition, the sultan’s actions caused loss of support for the Ottomans
      and the imperial form of government. Candidates may examine how Ataturk’s fame allowed him to
      take advantage of the unrest and become leader of the resistance to Sevres and the Ottomans.
      The First World War helped create the Russian Revolution and provided an opportunity for Ataturk
      to gain an alliance with the Bolsheviks against the West. Ataturk got Russian arms and used them
      to drive out the Greeks and then the British from Istanbul. Candidates may argue that this made
      him a national hero and leader of the reform movement. Ataturk used his power to end the Empire,
      evict the sultan and force the Allies to replace Sevres with a new treaty and make himself head of
      the Turkish republic. Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   Evaluate the impact of the Declaration of Independence on British influence in Egypt.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the Declaration of Independence on British
      influence in Egypt, weighing up its importance or otherwise. Impact may extend beyond the
      timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate
      significance by arguing that impact was limited, referring to the fact that the Declaration of
      independence was made unilaterally by Britain to protect its interests in an independent Egypt. No
      Egyptian input was permitted, and the head of the Wafd was deported. Britain retained control of
      the Suez Canal, the defence of Egypt, foreign relations and the Sudan. Britain intervened in the
      work of the constitutional convention to create a more democratic framework. Candidates may
      argue that the impact was significant by referring to the creation of an Egyptian parliament, and a
      growing nationalist movement which put some limit on British power. Nationalist agitation forced
      Britain to reduce its influence through the 1936 Treaty of Alliance. Both significance and limitations
      must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other,
      relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question.

26.   Discuss the importance of economic issues to the Arab–Jewish dispute in Palestine up to 1945.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of economic issues as a
      cause of the Arab-Jewish dispute in Palestine up to 1945. Causes may predate the timeframe but
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the impact of
      large Jewish land purchases supported by foreign capital and organised by Zionist agencies such
      as the Jewish National Fund. This caused landlessness, displacement and unemployment
      amongst Arabs. The wealth provided by outside sources gave Jews an economic advantage which
      caused resentment. Jewish industries and businesses displaced many Arab enterprises, leading to
      unrest, aided by the Jewish refusal to employ Arabs, leaving them in poverty. As the economy
      developed Jewish communities became increasingly urbanised, with the majority employed in
      relatively well-paying jobs. Candidates may also discuss the great influx of Jewish refugees in the
      1930s, which caused the Arabs to fear being overwhelmed and heaped further economic distress
      on Arab communities. This contributed to the outbreak of the Arab Rebellion of 1936-38. While
      other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
      in the question, and candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   Evaluate the success of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) up to 2000.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the success of the Organisation of African Unity up to 2000,
      weighing up its strengths and limitations. Factors identified may extend beyond the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to successes
      such as the OAU’s contribution to ending colonialism and the apartheid system in South Africa. Its
      Liberation Committee was established for this purpose. They may note that it was successful in
      promoting regional economic integration, working with organisations such as ECOWAS, SADCC
      and the EAC. It collaborated with the UN, working towards conflict resolution and solving social
      problems such as refugee crises. Candidates may also refer to failures, such the inability of the
      OAU to achieve closer integration due to fundamental ideological differences concerning Pan-
      Africanism among its members. Its non-intervention policy severely limited its capacity to respond
      to internal crises or civil wars, or to help rid the continent of dictators and despots. Candidates may
      also note its inability to prevent the withdrawal of Morocco from membership following recognition
      of the independence of the Western Sahara. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
      indicated, but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.

28.   “The Cold War had limited impact on African countries.” With reference to two African countries, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the Cold War had limited
      impact on African countries, with reference to two countries. Impact may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of the two countries, or they may prioritize their assessment of either. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may agree with the statement by referring to the fact that many countries managed to
      remain neutral during the Cold War, while the likes of Ghana and Tanzania were leading members
      of the Non-Aligned Movement. Countries received limited financial support from superpowers, and
      regional issues and organisations played a more important role in shaping diplomatic alignments
      than superpower rivalry. Candidates may disagree by arguing that some countries were
      destabilised due to superpower interference, or that they found themselves involved in proxy wars
      with neighbouring states. They may note that superpower support sometimes had the effect of
      propping up corrupt and unpopular governments. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree
      with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Discuss the consequences of the South African War up to 1909.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the course of the consequences of the
      South African War. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to lasting Anglo-Boer animosity,
      largely due to Boer anger at British wartime practices such as scorched earth tactics and use of
      concentration camps. They may discuss the impact of the Treaty of Vereeniging, which brought an
      end to the war and to the independence of the two Boer Republics. The post-war Milner
      government introduced policies which were aimed at Anglicizing the Boer population. However,
      these were a failure. After Milner’s departure British policies were more conciliatory, allowing the
      creation of Boer political parties and granting self-government to Transvaal and the Orange Free
      State. Candidates may discuss the impact of the 1909 Union Act which led to the formation of the
      Union of South Africa. This was dominated by Afrikaner political interests, to the complete
      exclusion of the African majority. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question, and candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

30.   “The Black Consciousness movement had a greater impact on resistance to apartheid than the
      African National Congress.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the Black
      Consciousness movement had a greater impact on resistance to apartheid than the African
      National Congress. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of either. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the
      significance of Black Consciousness in reinvigorating resistance to apartheid following the banning
      of the ANC. They may note its role in radicalising young Africans and the importance of student
      activism to the Soweto Uprising. They may discuss the impact of Biko as an icon of the struggle.
      Candidates may disagree with the statement by stressing the importance of the ANC in creating a
      mass movement against apartheid, and its involvement in protests like the Defiance Campaign. It
      continued to operate in exile, and through its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, following its
      banning. They may note that the influence of Black Consciousness faded following Biko’s death,
      with groups like the UDF becoming more significant. The unbanning of the ANC and the release of
      Mandela provided the final impetus to the end of apartheid. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   Evaluate the reasons for the growth of the Africanist churches.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the growth of the Africanist churches,
      weighing up their importance or otherwise. Reasons may predate the time frame but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may emphasise reasons such as the
      desire of African Christians to be separate from European control, and the schismatic traditions of
      the Protestant founders of the churches, which encouraged a desire for independence. Africans
      wanted churches that would incorporate African culture with Christian teachings and to allow
      different African ethnic groups to establish their own unique organizations, as was done in
      Ethiopia, Nigeria and other places. Africanist churches were centres for the training of African
      clergy and teachers which added to their appeal, and they helped expand cultural awareness.
      Candidates may stress that the establishment of the churches was in some cases supported and
      encouraged by European missionaries as a means to convert Africans to Christianity and limit the
      spread of Islam. Both importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need
      to be an equal number of/focus on each. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk
      of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

32.   “The impact of emigration was more positive than negative.” Discuss with reference to two African
      countries in the 20th century.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the impact of
      emigration was more positive than negative, with reference to two African countries.
      Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of either. However, both will be a feature of the response. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to negative impacts such as loss of
      population, specifically skilled members of the labour force. Emigration may create tensions with
      neighbouring countries who do not wish to accept large numbers of people from other countries.
      Similarly, migrants may form political resistance groups and encourage uprisings in the home
      country. Candidates may refer to positive impacts by stressing how migrants who can be of benefit
      through remittances and by using their positions to give economic, educational or diplomatic
      assistance to the home countries. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

      Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.   Evaluate the short-term factors that contributed to the outbreak of the 1948–49 War.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the short-term causes of the 1948-49 War, weighing up their
      importance or otherwise. Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the questions. Candidates may stress the importance of factors such as the aftermath of
      the Holocaust, which created enormous pressure for mass Jewish emigration to Palestine. This
      aroused Arab hostility in Palestine and from the surrounding Arab states. British post-war
      weakness led to a decision to abandon the mandate. Their actions led to a state of anarchy leading
      to communal violence and full-scale civil war in Palestine. Candidates may stress the significance
      of other causes such as the UN decision to divide Palestine, which roused great hostility amongst
      the Arabs as they stood to lose substantial territory. Widespread foreign financial and military
      support for the Jewish population encouraged them to take a militant approach in their relations
      with the British and the Arabs. The Jewish population declared the existence of the state of Israel
      which led to a full-scale invasion of the territory by The Arab armies and the onset of war.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

34.   “Economic factors were the most important cause of the 1979 Revolution in Iran.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that economic factors
      were the most important cause of the 1979 Revolution. Causes may predate the timeframe but
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may argue that economic
      factors were important by discussing policies such as land reform, which alienated landowners and
      had limited benefits for the landless. Government industrialization, infrastructure projects and
      military spending provided benefits but also created waste, corruption and inflation. High military
      spending diverted resources from public welfare and the opulent spending of the court created
      economic problems. Candidates may disagree with the statement by discussing the significance of
      other causes, for example greater women’s rights and changes to western dress, which caused
      resentment and resistance amongst conservative elements. Religious leaders mobilized resistance
      to modernization and westernization, particularly the Shah’s alliance with the USA and oil
      companies. The Shah’s brutal authoritarian government alienated the middle classes and
      progressive elements who had supported him. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates' opinion or
      conclusions will be clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.

35.   Evaluate the impact of military rule on two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of military rule in two states,
      weighing up its strengths and limitations. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may prioritize the discussion of one
      state but both must be a feature of the response. They may emphasise positive impact by
      discussing how military rule could remove a leader or group which was unpopular or harmful to the
      interests of the state. It could end civil strife or ethnic tensions, and project an orderly image to the
      outside world which could restore confidence amongst allies and investors. In the best case, it
      could provide a period of hiatus during which a new civilian government could be organized.
      Candidates may stress negative impact by examining how military rule could establish a principle
      of autocracy, preventing any progress toward multi-party democracy or civilian rule. The military
      could be dominated by one ethnic group, leading to persecution of individuals and other ethnicities.
      The military could use its power for corrupt and self-serving purposes, to the detriment of the
      population. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

36.   “Political stability was the most important reason for economic growth and development up to
      2005.” Discuss with reference to two African countries.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that political
      stability was the most important reason for economic growth. Reasons may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may prioritize the discussion of one country but both must be a feature of the response.
      They may refer to the argument that political stability provides confidence and
      encouragement to investors, both foreign and domestic, and businesses to expand the
      economy. Emigration of skilled individuals may be reduced and skilled labour from other
      countries may be attracted. The destruction and waste of internal strife and conflict are
      eliminated. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example the discovery of
      strategic resources or minerals which would attract capital and support growth. New
      international support from allies or international agencies may support growth with capital
      and skills training. New leadership or political programs may introduce new ideas for
      development and mobilize the population and resources that can support growth. While
      other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      issue raised in the question, and candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
