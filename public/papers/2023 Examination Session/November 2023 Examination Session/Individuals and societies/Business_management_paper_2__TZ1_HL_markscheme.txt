                                                   Section A

      1. (a) Define the term capital expenditure                                              [2]

Capital expenditure refers to money spent to acquire assets that have a useful life greater than one
year and may be used over and over again. Such items/assets are known as fixed assets and include
machinery, land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment.

N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.
Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the answer above. To
be awarded [2] the candidates must state that capital expenditure is for long-term fixed assets.

(b) Using a discount rate of 6% (Table 2), calculate the net present value (NPV) of the
production line for the Horizon at the beginning of 2022 and its first year of operating profit
(show all your working).                                                                                  [3]

NPV = Original cost + (Net profit before interest and tax + Depreciation) x 0.9434 + (Machinery sold x
0.9434)
NPV = -$1 300 000 + ($1 350 000 + 350 000 x .9434) + ($850 000 x .9434) = $1 105 670.

Award [3] for correct workings and for correct answer.
Award [2] if the candidate follows the correct procedure, however, they do not include the discounted
value of the equipment sold and thus have a NPV of $303 780 (i.e. $1603 780 - $1300 000).
Award [1] for some understanding of NPV and/or setting up the problem correctly but producing an
incorrect answer.
Award a maximum of [2] if $ sign missing. Accept if present in either the working or final answer.

(d) Referring to your calculations in part (c), explain which variance had the greatest impact on
XE’s operating profit variance in 2022.                                                    [2]

The greatest impact stemmed from the favourable variance of overheads/expenses. Sales revenue
was below the budgeted amount by $250k and cost of goods sold had an adverse variance of $100k.
Fortunately, by keeping expenses including depreciation $400k below budget, XE was able to offset the
two adverse variances and see a favourable variance in net profit before interest and tax of $50k.

Award [1] for stating that expenses including depreciation were the most impactful variance (Own Figure
Rule (OFR) applies) and an additional [1] for an explanation.

   the tertiary sector.                                [2]
  Types of business in the tertiary sector include:
   • Airlines;
   • banks / financial service;
   • cinemas;
   • distribution;
   • entertainment;
   • health care / nursing;
   • insurance;
   • leisure and tourism;
   • restaurants;
   • retailing;
   • schools;
   • transportation.
  Accept any other appropriate answer.

  N.B. no description is required.
  Award [1] for each relevant type of business in the tertiary sector. Award a maximum of [2].
  Award [1] only if a candidate provides two different retailers as answers such as supermarket and
  convenience store.

(b) Using information in Table 3, calculate for BE:

(i) the current ratio for 2021, X, in Table 4 (show all your working);                             [2]

Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
Current assets = Cash + debtors + stock = $3 000 + $2 992 +$6 000 = $11 992
Current liabilities = Creditors + 180-day loan = $1500 + $1 200 = $2 700
Current ratio = ($3 000 + $2 992 + $6 000)/($1500 + $1 200) = 4.44 (allow rounding)
Candidates may use figures as in tables (e.g. 3 000 or 3 000 000) as long as they are consistent in
their usage.

N.B. Accept 4.4.

Debtor days = (debtors / sales revenue) x 365
Debtor days = ($8908/$36 800) x 365 days = 88.35 days (allow rounding)
Candidates may use figures as in tables (e.g. 3 000 or 3 000 000) as long as they are consistent in
their usage.

N.B. Accept 88.4 or 88 days.

Award [1] for correct working and [1] for correct answer. The unit must be present in the final answer

(iii) the stock turnover in days for 2022, Z, in Table 4 (show all your working).                     [2]

Stock turnover = average stock / cost of goods sold
Average stock = (opening stock + closing stock) / 2 = $6 000 + $9 246)/2 = $7 623
Stock turnover = ([($6 000 + $9 246)/2]/$18 600) x 365 days = 149.59 days (allow rounding)
Candidates may use figures as in tables (e.g. 3 000 or 3 000 000) as long as they are consistent in
their usage.

Award [1] for correct working and [1] for correct answer. The unit must be present in the final answer

N.B. Accept 149.6 or 150 days.

If a candidate does not use the figure for average stock in their calculations but instead uses for
stock the figure $9246 and arrives at a turnover of 181.44 days, award [1].

(c) Referring to the information in Table 3 and Table 4, and your calculations in part (b),
explain the change in BE’s liquidity between 2021 and 2022.                                           [2]

All numerical figures in $000s.

Normally, when a current ratio or an acid test ratio improves (increases), the improvement is
interpreted as a good situation. In this case, the situation is the opposite. The increase in the
current ratio was driven by two developments: (1) Increased purchases, much of which did not
sell, caused stock to increase substantially, $6 000 to $9 246. (2) A major increase in debtor
days, which increased from 30 to 88 days. The combination of these two current asset accounts
without a corresponding proportional increase in current liability accounts meant that the current ratio
increased 4.44 to 5.46.

When liquidity is defined more narrowly as the acid test ratio the change from 2021 to 2022 was less
dramatic. The significant increase in debtor days meant that, mathematically, (cash + debtors)
increased at a faster rate than current liabilities. However, in this scenario, this “improvement” in
liquidity reflects a real loss of control of receipt of payment from debtors. Telling is that cash fell
from $3 000 to $1 000.

Award [1] for some accurate analysis of the situation and an additional [1] if the candidate conveys
that this “improvement” in liquidity stems from what are not good developments, increased stock
turnover and debtor days. Award a maximum of [2].

3.     (a)   Define the term variable costs.                                                            [2]

       Variable costs are recurring costs that change with output or activity. When sales or production
       increases, variable costs increase as well.

       N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.
       Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.
       If a candidate says "variable costs are costs that vary,” award [0]
       Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
       Award [2] for a definition that conveys full understanding. To receive [2], the candidate must
       specify that variable costs change with output or activity.

       (b) Using Table 5, construct a product position map/perception map of the three existing pet
       salons.                                                                                      [4]




     N.B. if a candidate uses the word “quality,” rather than “reputation,” accept.

     Award [1] for some understanding of a product position/perception map.

     Award [2] for a correctly drawn product position/perception map with axes properly labelled.

     Award [3] for a correctly drawn product position/perception map with axes properly labelled and has
     placed two of the three businesses in the correct place on the map.

     Award [4] for a correctly drawn product position/perception map with axes properly labelled and has
     placed the three businesses in the correct place on the map.

     N.B. The axes can be reversed (the Y axis could be price and the X axis could be reputation).

     Accept salon A if placed on or near to the reputation axis as this represents midway between high
     and low on the price axis.

     Accept abbreviations for labels so long as clear.

(c) Explain two problems that Anna may encounter when starting a new business.           [4]

   Common problems that new business encounters include:
   • Difficulty recruiting suitable employees as hers is new with no track record;
   • lack of finance - again new with no track record;
   • lack of identity or reputation in the marketplace - Anna has limited resources for promotion;
   • limited initial customer base (the market is very competitive);
   • owners have many demands on their time - Anna is possibly a sole trader;
   • lack of experience of those opening the business Anna has no managerial experience;
   • poor market research - Annas lack of financial resources may suggest this is true.

   Accept any other relevant problem that a new business may encounter.

   N.B. if Anna opens as an independent business, she will have to establish an identity in the
   marketplace (which would be less of an issue if she opens as a PB franchise).

   Award marks as follows:
   Mark as 2+2.
   Award [1] for identification of a common problem that a business may encounter and an
   additional [1] for an explanation and application to the stimulus. Award a maximum of [2].
   [2] can not be awarded per problem if the response lacks either explanation and / or
   application.
   For example:
   For an identification or a description of a problem with or without application [1].
   For explanation of a problem with no application [1].
   For explanation of a problem and application [2].
   Maximum award overall: [4].

(d) Recommend whether Anna should open her pet salon as an independent business (Option 1) or
as a PB franchise (Option 2).                                      [10]

Both options have advantages and disadvantages.

Option 1: advantages
• Anna is fully her own boss, which appeals to her;
• Anna has full decision control over what she does;
• she retains all revenue;
• forecasts are favourable. Anna does not “need” to be a franchise.

Option 1: disadvantages
• Many new businesses face a range of problems. She will have no support from a franchiser.
  She will be all on her own;
• she is entering a competitive market;
• Anna has no managerial experience.

Option 2: advantages
• Anna will be able to get equipment and supplies cheaper, presumably because the franchiser
  enjoys purchasing economies of scale;
• as a national chain, the PB brand is well known;
• PB will pay for national and regional promotion;
• franchisor offers support and guidance.

Option 2: disadvantages
• Anna wants to be her own boss. Operating a PB franchise, she will lose some control over
  her business;
• she has to pay a one-time fee to buy a franchise fee and, ongoing, 5% of her revenue;
                                             – 13 –                                8823 – 9227M


• the extant pet salon franchise in the market has a better reputation than PB, even though its
  prices are comparable;
• Anna will need to pay for local promotion – although not as much as Option 1.

       Accept any substantiated evaluation/judgment/recommendation.

       It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a substantiated
       judgment.

4. (a) Define the term objective.       [2]

       Objectives are the long, medium and short term targets/goals that can give a sense of
       direction to managers, departments, or the whole organization. Objectives form the basis for the
       decisions made on strategy.

       N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.
       Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.
       Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding similar to the
       above answer.
       Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the
       answer above.- For the 2nd mark, some mention that objectives are time-specific/measurable, or
       inform decision making, or form the basis for mission or vision statements – do not reward if a
       candidate specifies only a single time period e.g short-term.

       (b) With reference to VS, explain two elements of organizational culture.      [4]

       Organizational culture are the shared values, attitudes and beliefs of the people working in
       an organization that control the way they interact with each other and external stakeholder
       groups.
       Aspects of the culture can be gained through the following:
       • Mission and vision statements: these help to position the business in terms of the overall
          aims. For VS, the vegan philosophy is key, hence as the majority of staff are vegan this
          impacts organizational culture in a major way
       • the record of senior staff: Michael is central to the way VS operates. It was his vision to
          establish VS and to promote veganism through it;
       • VS’s ethical code of conduct: nothing in the text but the implied notion of vegan lifestyles
          would suggest a positive ethical stance;
       • strategies on social and environmental issues: this will set the tone for how the business is
          perceived and judged in terms of their impact on social and environmental issues;
       • the example set by senior managers: this includes how they treat the staff; how they take
          decisions, etc.;
       • the industry that the business operates in: VS is a vegan food supplier, and this
          influences the culture that operates within VS.
       • the use of quality control method by VS might suggest a more traditional organizational
          structure i.e top down hierarchy, although there is no evidence to support this.

       Accept any other relevant element/explanation.

       Mark as 2+2

       Award [1] for each element identified and an additional [1] for development with application to
       VS. Award a maximum of [2] per element.
       [2] can not be awarded per element if the response lacks either explanation and/or application.
       For example:
       For an identification or a description of an element with or without application [1].
       For explanation of an element with no application [1].
       For explanation of an element and application [2].
       Maximum award overall: [4].

(c) Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for VS of using below-the-line promotion.       [4]

  Below-the-line promotion is promotion that is not a directly paid-for means of communication
  but based on short term incentives to purchase e.g. sales promotion techniques.

  Advantages could include:
  • VS can work directly with their customers and suppliers to ensure that products are required
    and are sold in the best way;
  • communication is direct and highly targeted most probably by word of mouth as evidenced
    by use of trade exhibitions;
  • they can build customer loyalty more easily---VS has built a strong customer base with
    targeted communication;
  • it is easier to monitor spending and to evaluate the effectiveness of the promotion;
  • vegan supplies are likely a small market where Michael knows all the relevant players and can
    better deal directly.

  Disadvantages could include:
  • it may be more difficult to reach new customers—highly targeted promotion may not enhance
     their overall desire to increase sales;
  • Michael needs to ensure that he understands his customers really well;
  • the approach may not be effective if he is trying to expand his market;
  • customers may not like the need to communicate on a one-to-one basis;
  • whilst customers may like the products sold by VS, they may not like dealing with Michael
     and/or his team;
  • it can be time-consuming to come up with a targeted more personalized approach.

   Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

  Mark as 2+2

  Award [1] for one appropriate advantage and an additional [1] for a development with respect to
  VS. Award a maximum of [2].
  Award [1] for one appropriate disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for a development with
  respect to VS. Award a maximum of [2].

  [2] cannot be awarded per advantage/disadvantage if the response lacks either explanation and /
  or application.
  For example:
  For an identification or a description of an advantage/disadvantage with or without application
  [1].
  For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no application [1].
  For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].
  Maximum award overall: [4].

(d) Recommend whether Michael should move from a system of quality control to a system of quality
assurance.            [10]

 Michael has two options listed in the question.
  Continue to use a system of quality control (Option 1)
  Quality control is a system where products are sampled as they are completed to ensure
  that agreed standards have been reached. It assumes that workers are not able to monitor
  quality themselves and need staff at the end of the production line checking products.
  Advantages
  • Quality is in the hands of experts—VS employ staff whose role is mostly or fully to check
     production;
  • patterns of inconsistent production can be spotted—common ‘mistakes’ in production can
     be spotted;
  • defective products are spotted—the checking ensures that defective output discovered can
     be removed from sale. VS’s production staff are not always in control of their own output,
     including the quality of the finished product.
  Disadvantages
  • ‘Big Brother’—checking for defective products can be a negative way of monitoring
     performance. The inspection team is rewarded to ‘catch out’ the performance of others;
  • the workforce can become sloppy—the workers of VS could start relying on the inspection
     team to find the faulty output;
  • not every product is checked—the sampling process does not check every product.

   Change to a system of quality assurance (Option 2)
   Quality assurance involves instilling quality throughout the organization as part of the
   production process. Quality assurance places an emphasis on customer requirements.
   Workers are required to self-check every aspect of what they contribute to the production
   process. Aspects of lean production (kaizen, TQM, etc.) would be incorporated into the
   production process at VS.

   Advantages
   • Workers take more care—giving the workforce a greater responsibility would encourage
     them to improve;
   • increased motivation of the workers—this is a process of job enrichment that can improve
     overall motivation. VS’s workers may respond in a positive way to the extra responsibility;
   • reduced costs—inspection staff do not need to be employed reducing overall costs. This will
     save VS money which can be reallocated to other areas of their operation;
   • VS’s workers are best placed to improve quality—the workforce directly involved in
     production are in the best position to improve quality.

   Disadvantages
   • The workforce may reject it—giving staff additional responsibilities may be unpopular. They
      may not want to have more to do;
   • increased demands on the workforce—this role may increase the stress on the workers
      leading to demotivation. VS’s staff may not want to do anything other than their ‘usual’ job
   • increased initial cost—transferring to quality assurance can be costly and disruptive due to
      training and implementation;
   • Some products may not need it—in some markets and for some products there may be no
      need to have a complicated system.

   Evaluation:
   Michael will need to assess whether the change to quality assurance is worth the expense and
   disruption. There are cost implications and the staff will need to be accepting of the change.
   The wider issue of change management is key. Staff who share the vision of Michael are likely
   to adapt and respond to changes that he proposes.
                                          – 17 –                                     8823 – 9227M


He will need to balance the disruption with any possible benefits from being able to improve
quality. VS is shown as a high-quality producer which might mean that they are doing what
they need to already. Michael may have the view that quality could be improved still further.
The added impact of improving staff motivation and further enhancing the ethos and culture of
veganism may appeal strongly to Michael.
The switch may not work for both aspects of VS’s business. i.e., it may work for the wholesale
aspect but not the production aspect.

It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a substantiated judgment.

Accept any substantiated evaluation/judgment/recommendation.

5.   (a) Define the term intrapreneur.           [2]

     Being an intrapreneur is the act of being an entrepreneur while working for a major
     corporation. The intrapreneur is innovative, independent, proactive and generates new ideas for
     the organization.

     N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.

     Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.
     Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
     Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys understanding similar to the answer above.

     N.B. the use of the word entrepreneur is not mandatory but incorporating any of the features listed
     while working for an employer are mandatory for [2]. Do not accept risk-taking since it is not his/her
     risk it is the organization that takes the risk.

     (b) With reference to UWG, explain two reasons why Ali’s crisis management response may have
     been effective.     [4]

     Crisis management refers to the response of a business to a crisis situation. It is how an
     organization or individual (Ali) reacts to a crisis which has already happened and could cause
     harm to the business. It is almost impossible to plan for a crisis situation and, as such, the
     management of the issue is reactive.

     Key reasons why it may have been effective:

     Transparency/Accountability - Ali immediately reported the incident and did not try to cover it up.
     He admitted it had happened and this may be better for the long-term reputation of UWG.
     Communication - Ali used social media to try to contain the crisis and try to reassure all key
     stakeholders he was taking action. This could then be widely shared and would get UWG’s message
     out to the public.
     Speed - The speed of UWG’s response could help to contain the situation. This could help UWG
     to control the message and stop false information being shared.
     Control - Ali took control of the situation and did not leave it to a lower manager. He would be
     able to release funds to help with compensation. Ali leading the crisis management shows how
     important UWG was taking the concerns.

     N.B. responses are not required to use the exact highlighted headings as above but can convey the
     general meaning.

     Accept any other relevant reason that indicates the result of some action taken by Ali or UWG.

     Mark as 2+2

     Award [1] for one appropriate reason and an additional of [1] for a development with respect to
     UWG. Award a maximum of [2]

(c) Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for UWG of using social media marketing.        [4]

  Social media marketing refers to gaining interest in your business through the use of social
  media websites.

  Advantages include:
  • they are able to communicate quickly with their customers such as when Ali released the
    video;
  • the customers feel part of the business when they can strike up potential friendships with
    PTs and other customers;
  • it is cheaper than above-the-line promotion. This could help UWG to keep their prices
    competitive;
  • Disadvantages include:
  • they can lose control of the message. UWG has little control over what people post on social
    media regarding the company. This has happened with the reaction to the accident;
  • social media posted responses could harm the reputation of the company and may affect
    membership numbers.

  Mark as 2+2

  Award [1] for one appropriate advantage and an additional [1] for a development with respect to
  UWG. Award a maximum of [2].
  Award [1] for one appropriate disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for a development with
  respect to UWG. Award a maximum of [2].

  [2] can not be awarded per advantage/disadvantage if the response lacks either explanation and /
  or application.
  For example:

  For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].
  Maximum award overall: [4].

(d) Evaluate two industrial/employee relations methods that UWG could use to get the PTs to accept
a new contract.           [10]

  Potential industrial/employee relations methods UWG can use include:

  Collective bargaining
  In this case, UWG’s management and employee representatives would try to reach an
  agreement through negotiation. This may mean UWG has to increase the wages of the PTs
  which could affect their ability to offer competitive pricing.
  Collective bargaining could mean UWG is able to retain the services of the majority of the PTs.
  This could be important as the PTs are popular with the members and seem to enhance their
  membership experience. UWG needs to be wary of seeming not to value its PTs in the eyes of its
  membership. UWG has also found it difficult to recruit well qualified PTs, it is maybe in their
  best interest to find a solution to the issue that satisfies both parties.

  Threats of redundancies
  This is a more serious threat by UWG where they would pressure or intimidate the PTs to accept
  the new contract. If they do not accept the new contract then they would be made redundant.
  Once again UWG needs to be wary of seeming not to value its PTs in the eyes of its membership if
  it drives a hard bargain with the new contract.
                                           – 20 –                                    8823 – 9227M


UWG would need to check all their actions were legal within employment law. It might not be as
simple as to force the PTs to sign a new contract. A worry for UWG is that PTs actually take up
their offer of redundancy meaning UWG is left having to recruit a lot of new employees, this has
already proved difficult. It is also expensive to conduct a large-scale recruitment process, can
UWG afford this? If most of the members are sympathetic to the PTs then this could seriously
damage UWG’s reputation. Are their members brand loyal or will they look for another gym?
Alternatively, this threat could cause the PTs to drop their complaints and sign the new
contract. This would mean UWG could continue operating as normal.

Closure
This would mean UWG close the gyms which do not have enough employees to operate. This
means all employees from these gyms would receive no wages at all. This would pressurize the
30% of PTs who are taking strike action to re-consider and perhaps sign the new contract.
Obviously, this would upset members of these gyms and this could seriously harm UWG’s
reputation.
The threat of closure is effectively UWG employing a divide and rule strategy, which whilst
possibly successful in the short term could further sow seeds of discontent among the workforce
for the future.

Evaluation
It is in UWG’s interest to try to stop the strike action and open all their gyms as soon as
possible. This may mean they have to negotiate with the PTs and try to come to an
agreement.

N.B. there is a fine distinction between Industrial relations and Conflict resolution. Since the
aim of UWG is to resolve the impending strike action reward conflict resolution methods such as
Arbitration / Conciliation if presented.

It is not expected that the candidate incorporates all of the above arguments.
Accept any other relevant industrial/employee relations method and any other relevant discussion.
A conclusion with judgment is expected.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further guidance below.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3].
For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].
If a candidate evaluates only one option, award a maximum of [5].
A balanced response is one that covers at least one issue for and at least one argument against
each option.
Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance as long as at least two arguments
are given for each option.
Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced analysis and
understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus material but there is no
judgment/conclusion.
Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions that are not based
on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.
It is expected that the candidate goes beyond just providing some relevant arguments for or
against any suggested strategy and finish off with some conclusions and judgment.
Candidates cannot reach the top marks if there is no relevant reference/application to the
stimulus.

                                               Section C
6.   With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization on
     operations management strategy.                                                   [20]

7.   With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of culture on
     ethics.                                                                            [20]

8.   With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
     change in human resource management.                                              [20]


Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on pages 4 and 5.

 N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still expected that
Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the second concept (the one
being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to be based
on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the
candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be
met for that mark to be awarded.
• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable by a
candidate.
• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily reach high
levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
• Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
• Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept may be
more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1 + 1 arguments are expected per concepts.
Questions 6, 7 and 8 require consideration of the impact / influence of one concept and a second
concept – therefore accept 1 + 1 arguments for each concept for a balanced response.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are all one-sided
then this would be unjustified.
• For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located between the
introduction and the conclusion.
                                                    – 22 –                                    8823 – 9227M


• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For example, one
idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager. However,
this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with specific
explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
• Please do not use the adjective ‘inappropriate’ in the descriptor for [2]. If inappropriate award [1].

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A and B and in
the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to questions 6, 7 and 8.
When this happens please award marks as follows:
Criterion A: award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant if the
organization is fictitious.
Criterion B: 0 marks – there is no connection to a “real-world organization”
Criterion C: award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is fictitious.
Criterion D: mark as normal.
Criterion E: award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be
relevant if the organization is fictitious.
