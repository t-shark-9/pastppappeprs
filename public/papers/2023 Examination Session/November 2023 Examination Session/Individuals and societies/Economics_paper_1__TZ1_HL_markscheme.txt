1.     (a)   Explain two determinants of price elasticity of demand.                                  [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: price elasticity of demand, demand.
             • Explanation: that price elasticity of demand depends upon a number of determinants and
               two of them should be explained, such as the number and closeness of substitutes,
               degree of necessity, proportion of income spent on the good, time and others.
             • Diagram: to show price elasticity of demand, for example changing along a straight-line
               demand curve or diagrams of relatively more or less elastic demand curves.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one of the two determinants is addressed.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss how a government might respond to a situation in
      which there is a high concentration ratio in a market.                                  [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: concentration ratio, oligopoly, monopoly, market.
      • Explanation: governments might intervene in markets where there is a high concentration
        ratio because it might indicate abuse of market power from either monopoly or oligopoly
        firms, leading to higher prices, lower output, and allocative inefficiency. Therefore, the
        government might intervene in the form of taking ownership, regulation and legislation,
        and fines.
      • Diagram: to show a firm with market power in imperfect competition such as monopoly/
        collusive oligopoly.
      • Real-world example: of where a government has intervened in a market where there is a
        high concentration ratio. Examples might be government ownership (nationalization) of
        key industries, price controls in natural monopolies, regulation, legislation and fines
        imposed on monopoly/oligopoly firms.
      • Synthesis (discuss): might be framed around the different policy options open to
        government and the advantages and disadvantages they might present or how effective
        they are likely to be. Increased government influence through nationalization, fines and
        regulations and legislation has advantages and disadvantages. Students might also
        choose to contest the idea that intervention is necessary, and they might give reasons for
        where government might allow a highly concentrated market where there were economies
        of scale or innovation.

2.     (a)   Explain how changes in two determinants of investment could lead to an increase in real
             gross domestic product (GDP).                                                           [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: investment, real gross domestic product (GDP).
             • Explanation: of how a change in any of the determinants of investment, such as interest
               rates, technology, business confidence, business taxes, and level of corporate
               indebtedness, could lead to increased investment spending. Increased investment
               spending leads to increases in aggregate demand and increased real GDP. In addition,
               increased investment, by increasing the quantity of capital goods, a factor of production,
               leads to increases in long-run aggregate supply in the monetarist/new classical model or
               increases in Keynesian AS in the Keynesian model (increased real GDP).
             • Diagram: showing a shift of aggregate demand and an increase in AS in the Keynesian
               model OR an increase in long run aggregate supply in the monetarist/new classical
               model. Students may use either a Keynesian OR monetarist/new classical approach and
               still obtain full marks.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one of the two determinants is addressed.

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: gross national income, economic well-being.
      • Explanation: an explanation of the ways in which measures for GNI indicate higher
        economic well-being (standards of living) through the increases in incomes they measure
        and the increased living standards they can support.
      • Diagram: not needed for this question.
      • Real-world example: real-world examples of where GNI statistics are, or are not, a useful
        way of measuring economic well-being.
      • Synthesis (discuss): consideration of where GNI statistics are or are not a good measure
        of economic well-being. Discussion might include consideration of inequality of income
        and wealth, externalities, the informal economy, output not put up for sale, unpaid work,
        statistical error, composition of output, depletion of natural resources and so on.
        Consideration of alternative measures of economic well-being such as the OECD Better
        Life Index, Happiness Index and Happy Planet Index.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already been

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of trading blocs. [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: trading blocs.
      • Explanation: explanation of the advantages of trade bloc membership such as trade
        creation, greater access to markets (economies of scale), free movement of labour and
        greater employment possibilities, stronger bargaining power in multilateral negotiations,
        greater political stability and cooperation, living standards and growth. Disadvantages of
        trading bloc membership including trade diversion, loss of sovereignty and challenge to
        multilateral trading negotiations.
      • Diagram: a trade protection diagram which identifies advantages and disadvantages of
        free trade between members of a bloc.
      • Real-world example: examples of one or more of the world's trading blocs and the
        advantages and disadvantages of trading bloc membership.
      • Synthesis (discuss): the members of the bloc may experience disadvantages if significant
        trade diversion takes place. If non-members with absolute and comparative advantage are
        restricted in their ability to trade or excluded by prohibitive tariffs, then consumers and
        businesses will face additional costs. Discussion of whether the advantages outweigh the
        disadvantages of trading bloc membership. Overall assessment.
