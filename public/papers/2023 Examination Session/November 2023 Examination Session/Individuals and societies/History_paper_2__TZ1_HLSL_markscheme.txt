           substantiated assertions.
    0      Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Examine the impact of changes in social structures and systems on two societies, each chosen
     from a different region.

     Candidates will consider the impact of changes in social structures and systems on two societies.
     The two societies must be from different regions, but they may or may not have been
     contemporaneous. The impact of changes may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
     societies, or they may prioritize their examination of one of them. However, both societies will be a
     feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer
     to the impact of changes to the role of women, such as during the Tang dynasty when female
     enslavement became the norm. The impact of changes in class structure may be examined, for
     example the multiplication of Indian castes, and the introduction of the Tokugawa class system in
     Japan, or there may be a focus on the assimilation of migrant populations such as the Vikings into
     parts of western Europe and the Rus into Muscovy. The impact of changes in the pattern of
     landholding and obligations associated with it may be examined, such as the European feudal
     system or the impact of Aztec settlements as they transitioned from being migrant to permanent,
     around Tenochtitlan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.

2.   Evaluate the impact of two key individuals on cultural and intellectual developments in the period
     750–1400.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of two key individuals on cultural and intellectual
     developments in the period 750-1400, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two
     individuals may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been
     contemporaries. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both individuals, or they may
     prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both will be a feature of the response. A
     comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may evaluate Chaucer’s influence on
     the English language, Dante’s pioneering of the use of the vernacular or Hildegard of Bingen’s
     impact on music. There may be evaluation of the patronage of Mansa Musa, who established a
     centre of Islamic learning in Mali, Wenzong’s codification of literature, artworks and calligraphy, or
     Caliph al-Mansur's introduction of foreign scholarship to the Arab audience. Both importance and
     limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –5–                                      8823 – 5304M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   Evaluate the importance of the short- and long-term causes of two wars.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of two medieval wars weighing up the importance or otherwise
     of the long and short-term causes. The two wars may or may not be from different regions and may
     or may not be contemporaneous. Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate the importance of the long- and the
     short-term causes in Europe and the Middle East of one or more of the Crusades. Causes may
     include Papal concerns over feuding among nobles; access of pilgrims to Christian sites in
     Jerusalem; access to land, resources and trade. The relative importance of issues of succession
     upon the death of Tezozomoc, and the emergence of the Aztec Triple Alliance as causes of the
     Tepanec War may be evaluated, or the importance of rival claimants to the title and lands of the
     Great Khan, among other causes of the Toluid civil war. The relative importance of the long- and
     short-term causes of the Norman invasion of England may be evaluated with issues such as
     succession to the English throne and the weakness of the English monarchy weighed against the
     ambitions of the Duke of Normandy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.

4.   “The most significant effect of war was demographic change.” With reference to two wars, to what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits, or otherwise, of the statement that the most significant effect of
     war was demographic change. The two wars may or may not be from the same region and may or
     may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Consequences may extend beyond the
     timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     consider the demographic impact of the Crusades upon Europe and/or the Middle East where, for
     example, there was a significant increase in Christian settlements. The effect of the Hundred Years
     War leading to a decline in the population of France would also be relevant. In Asia, the extension
     of the Mongol Empire affected the population of China, with some regions being subject to a
     decline in population. Similarly, the effect of wars led to the abandonment of cities and the decline
     of the Mayan Empire. While other relevant effects such as shifts in borders or change of ruler or
     religion may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in question.
     Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                                     8823 – 5304M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   “Rulers were rarely successful in achieving their aims.” Discuss with reference to two rulers, each
     chosen from a different region.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that rulers were rarely
     successful in achieving their aims. The two rulers must be from different regions, but they may or
     may not have been contemporaries. Achievements and failures may extend beyond the timeframe,
     but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of the two rulers, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both
     rulers will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may discuss rulers such as Louis XI of France and Charlemagne, who were
     overwhelmingly successful both militarily and in promoting domestic prosperity. Itzcoatl too laid the
     foundations of the Aztec Empire and presided over the construction of a new capital city. Others,
     such as Harun al-Rashid and Emperor Huizong had mixed records, both established vibrant
     cultural centres but failed to stifle internal and/or external threats. Candidates may agree, partly
     agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.

6.   Compare and contrast the methods of government and administration of two rulers.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the methods of
     government and administration of two rulers, referring to both throughout. The two rulers may or
     may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaries. For
     comparison, candidates may refer to the importance of legal reform to rulers such as Emperor
     Frederick I and Henry II of England. Both Emperor Hongwu and Genghis Khan established a
     meritocratic civil service. Basil III and Genghis Khan both strove to contain the power of noble
     families, either by the redistribution of noble estates or the awarding of positions of honour
     according to bravery and loyalty rather than hereditary title. In contrast, there is little record of
     Timur setting up institutions of state as he relied on terror and military prowess. Both similarities
     and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –7–                                    8823 – 5304M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Examine the impact of changing patterns of trade on the economies of two countries.

     Candidates will consider the interrelationship between changing patterns of trade and the
     economies of two countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region. A
     comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may examine the impact of the spice
     trade upon the economy of the Netherlands and how this shifted the focus of trade away from
     Europe as well as significantly increasing the wealth of the country. There may be an examination
     of the impact upon Venice of the Portuguese trade with Africa and the Orient, and how this
     contributed to the decline of the Venetian economy. The harmful impact upon the Spanish
     economy of the influx of gold and silver from the Americas may be examined. In India, the
     establishment of the English East India Trading Company and the impact this had upon local
     economies may be examined. An examination of the impact of indentured labour and the slave
     trade upon the economies of the Thirteen Colonies would also be relevant as well as the impact
     the slave trade had upon the Kingdom of Allada, for example. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

8.   Discuss the cultural and intellectual impact of two key figures, each chosen from a different region.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the cultural and intellectual impact of
     two key figures. The two key figures must be chosen from a different region but may or may not
     have been contemporaries. Their impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly
     linked to the issue in the question. Candidates may discuss Li Shizhen (1518-1593) who was
     renowned for his medical texts, especially concerning inoculations and treatment of smallpox.
     Wang Yangmin (1472-1529) had a significant impact on philosophy with his emphasis on “innate
     knowledge” leading, ultimately, to a rejection of Song/Ming ideologies. In the Americas, the
     influence of Bartolome de Las Casas (1484-1566) may be discussed as he worked to institute and
     protect the rights of the indigenous population as embodied in the New Laws of 1542. Machiavelli
     (1459-1527), diplomat, philosopher and historian was influential far beyond Florence and the court
     of the Medicis. His book, “The Prince”, influenced ruling dynasties throughout Europe. Ottoman
     astronomer Taqi-al-din (1526-1585) was a renowned engineer and inventor as well as a
     philosopher and theologian. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                                    8823 – 5304M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    “The nature of rule was the main reason for the ascendancy of states.” Discuss with reference to
      two states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the nature of rule was
      the main reason for the ascendancy of states. The two states may or may not be from the same
      region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Reasons may
      predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states, or they may prioritize their discussion of
      one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may
      or may not be used. Candidates may discuss the ascent of Peter the Great’s Russia, that was
      founded on reforms of government while remaining heavily dependent on the leader’s personality.
      The ascent of the Tokugawa Shogunate was supported by powerful shoguns and daimyo, efficient
      administration and lucrative taxation. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree
      or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

10.   “Issues of succession were the main cause of internal conflict.” Discuss with reference to two early
      modern states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that issues of succession
      were the main cause of internal conflict. The two states may or may not be from the same region
      and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Causes may predate the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of the two states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
      both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may discuss a series of disputed successions which blighted the later Mughal Empire
      and the imperial reigns of Kangxi (the Nine Lords’ War) and Yongzheng Civil War, fought between
      half-brothers who claimed succession, weakened the Inca Empire in the face of Pizarro’s threat.
      Alternatively, the English Civil War was fought over constitutional, economic and religious issues.
      While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –9–                                    8823 – 5304M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the impact of technological developments on the outcome of two wars, each chosen from
      a different region.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of technological developments on the
      outcome of two wars. The two wars must be chosen from different regions, but they may or may
      not have been contemporaneous with each other. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may evaluate the importance of technology on the defeat of the Spanish Armada
      with reference to the development of naval tactics and the fast re-loading of cannons deployed by
      the English fleet. There may be an evaluation of the deployment of smaller but better-trained
      armies by Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years War along with the application of technology
      such as the use of muskets, making armies more mobile. The impact of technology such as the
      use of gunpowder and musketry was significant to the outcome of the Spanish conquest of the
      Aztec Empire. The importance of rocketry used by the Mughal army in the Siege of Bidar during
      the consolidation of the empire, may be evaluated. While other relevant factors such as skillful
      strategy; effective leadership; the weakness of enemies may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

12.   “Peacemaking that followed wars was rarely successful.” With reference to two wars, to what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that peacemaking that
      followed wars was rarely successful. The two wars may or may not be from the same region and
      may or may not be contemporaneous with each other. The consequences of peacemaking may
      extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. In
      China, the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) went some way to regularizing relations between China and
      Russia but was followed in 1727 by the Treaty of Kiakhta that encouraged religious and cultural
      exchanges as well as addressing issues such as trade that had continued to imperil peacemaking.
      The Treaty of Nasuh Pasha between the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia was signed in 1612
      although disputes over the payment of tribute led to the renewal of warfare. Meanwhile, the Treaty
      of Westphalia (1648) may be seen to have brought a period of peace and stability to Europe
      following the Thirty Years War. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement,
      but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 10 –                                  8823 – 5304M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate the impact of technological developments on industrialization in two countries.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of technological developments on industrialization
      in two countries, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two countries may or may not be
      from the same region. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both countries will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may appraise the impact
      of developments in transport, such as railways and canals, in transporting raw materials and
      finished products. New technology, such as the cotton gin and the steam engine, gave impetus to
      the Industrial Revolution and enabled mass production. The use of new technology in agriculture
      increased yield and helped to feed the new industrial towns. Both importance and limitations must
      be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

14.   Discuss the social impact of urbanization on two countries.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the social impact of urbanisation on two
      countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region. Impact may extend beyond
      the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of both countries, or they may prioritize their examination of one of them.
      However, both countries will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Candidates may discuss problems related to public health and poor housing, or, more
      positively, in the long term, improved access to healthcare and education. There may be
      discussion of how poor urban social provision may have impacted on levels of poverty, crime and
      social disunity. Commonly, urbanization has led to depopulation of the countryside and so
      impacted rural communities and family structure. There may be discussion of living conditions in
      suburbia, for example, compared to inner cities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 11 –                                  8823 – 5304M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Evaluate the importance of external factors in the growth of two independence movements, each
      chosen from a different region.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of external factors in the growth of two
      independence movements, weighing up their strengths and importance or otherwise. The two
      independence movements must be from different regions. The external factors may predate the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of each independence movement, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of
      them. However, both movements will be a feature of the response. Candidates may appraise the
      importance of external military help as a factor in fostering independence, for example, the role of
      France and the United Kingdom in demands for the independence of Greece. Candidates may also
      evaluate the importance of economic factors, for example in the independence of Cuba. They may
      also evaluate the importance of the Cold War, for example, in the movements for Angolan
      independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

16.   “Non-violent methods were more effective than violent methods in achieving independence.”
      Discuss with reference to two states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that non-violent methods were
      more effective than violent methods in achieving independence. The two states may or may not be
      from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states, or they may prioritize their discussion of
      one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may
      or may not be used. Candidates may discuss the initially disappointing results from the use of non-
      violent methods in India, noting that independence, while accompanied by violence, was achieved,
      in part, due to the economic weakness of Britain. Violence was centrally important to Bolivar’s
      victories in South America and to the achievement of independence in Greece and Algeria. Despite
      military victory over the Spanish, Filipino independence was eventually granted peacefully by the
      US. In Kenya, the violence associated with the Mau-Mau movement and its suppression may be
      discussed along with non–violent methods and the leadership of Kenyatta in achieving
      independence. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)


17.   “Economic forces were the most important influence on the development of democratic states.”
      Discuss with reference to two states, each chosen from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced response to the statement that economic forces
      were the most important influence on the development of democratic states. The two democratic
      states must be from different regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with
      each other. Candidates may discuss how the economic impact of the First World War along with
      reparation payments made for a rocky start to Weimar Germany whilst the perceived stability of the
      “Golden Years” contributed to its democratic development prior to its demise due, in part, to the
      Great Depression. During the post-war occupation of Japan, the liberal economic policies of the
      “New Dealers” may be discussed and linked to the push for greater democracy. In post-war Italy,
      the impact of the Marshall Plan may be discussed as a factor that contributed to the “economic
      miracle” of the 1950s and the steadying of post-war democracy. In Argentina, economy crises
      threatened democracy, that evolved only upon their resolution. While other relevant factors may be
      referred to, such as governmental institutions or political representation, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree
      with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

18.   “Policies towards women were rarely successful in achieving their aims.” Discuss with reference to
      two democratic states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced response to the statement that policies towards
      women were rarely successful in achieving their aims. The two democratic states may or may not
      be from different regions and may or may not be contemporaneous with each other. Candidates
      may discuss women being given the right to vote in Japan in 1945 and being free to marry without
      the permission of the patriarch of the family. However, full economic and social equality remained
      elusive. In the US, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 may be seen to have had some success and various
      ERA measures were adopted by many, but not all, states. In South Africa, legislation was passed
      to ensure equal pay for women and protection against domestic violence but with limited success.
      In the UK, the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970 and paid maternity leave became law in 1994. In
      India, the Sati Prevention Act was passed in 1987 although this was perceived by some as
      government interference in religious belief. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   To what extent did social division contribute to the emergence of two authoritarian states, each
      chosen from a different region?

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the extent to which social division
      contributed to the emergence of two authoritarian states. The two authoritarian states must be
      drawn from different regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each
      other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two authoritarian states, or they may emphasize
      their discussion of one of them; however, both authoritarian states will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may consider social division in China prior to the emergence of the PRC and
      how Mao galvanized the peasantry that had been alienated from the GMD. For Russia, there may
      be consideration of how Lenin used rhetoric to appeal to the proletariat and to build opposition to
      the Provisional Government. In Cuba, Castro focused on the need for social justice and building
      opposition to the government of Batista. In Argentina, Peron made much of the support given to
      him by the “descamisados”. Other relevant factors to be considered may include economic crises,
      the use of force, the impact of war. Candidates’ opinions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

20.   “The use of force was the most important method used to maintain power in authoritarian states.”
      Discuss with reference to two authoritarian states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement. The two authoritarian
      states may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two authoritarian
      states, or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both authoritarian states
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss campaigns against political enemies and
      the use of torture, executions, prison and censorship, for example by Mao before and during the
      Cultural Revolution, or Stalin and the Great Terror. They may also discuss the role of paramilitary
      forces or special police, for example the Sturmabteilung (the SA) and the Gestapo in Nazi
      Germany. While other relevant factors, for example propaganda, economic and social policies, or
      charismatic leadership, may be discussed, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
      in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   “The most important causes of wars were political.” With reference to two wars, to what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the most important causes of
      two wars were political. The two wars may or may not be from the same region and they may or
      may not be contemporaneous with each other. Causes may predate the timeframe but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised by the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two
      wars, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may consider wars which were caused by disputes over politically
      important areas, for example the Balkans in 1914. Some civil wars, such as the Irish Civil War,
      may have been caused, in part, by unequal political rights, or to eliminate political opposition (for
      example, the Russian Civil War), while others, such as the Nicaraguan Civil War, were an aspect
      of ideological Cold War conflict. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, economic
      causes, racial and/or religious tension, aggressive leadership or territorial ambition, but with a
      focus on the issue raised by the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

22.   “The most significant effects of war were economic.” Discuss with reference to two wars, each
      chosen from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the most significant
      effects of war were economic. The two wars must be from different regions, but they may or may
      not be contemporaneous with each other. Effects of the wars may extend beyond the timeframe,
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of both wars, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both wars
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the costs of conducting wars, which may
      have required addressing deficits, or the repayments of bonds. Similarly, mention may be made of
      the costs of rebuilding infrastructure or relocating displaced populations. Candidates may also
      discuss the economic impact of peace settlements, such as the reparation payments and loss of
      industrial areas imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example territorial changes, political, social and demographic impact, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “Fear, rather than aggression, was the main cause of superpower rivalry between 1943 and
      1949.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that fear, rather than
      aggression, was the main cause of superpower rivalry between 1943 and 1949. Causes may
      predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      They may consider Stalin’s fear of a reunited, revived Germany as being partly responsible
      for the Berlin Blockade. Russian fears of US expansion into Europe were also heightened by
      the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. US fears may have been stoked by Kennan’s
      Long Telegram, which significantly influenced American diplomacy. Russian actions in
      Eastern Europe, which were arguably in contravention of promises made at Yalta, were
      regarded by the US as aggressive; however, the USSR was shattered by war, and arguably
      motivated mostly by fear. Other relevant factors may be considered such as the impact of
      the US advancement in nuclear weaponry and the failure of the Baruch Plan. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

24.   Evaluate the impact of two Cold War crises on superpower rivalry.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of two Cold War crises on superpower
      rivalry. The two crises may or may not be from the same region and may or may not be
      contemporaneous with each other. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must
      be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of both crises or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both crises
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate the impact of a Cold War crisis
      in positioning superpowers in opposing camps, for instance the Berlin Blockade.
      Candidates may evaluate the impact of crises such as Korea (1950) or Congo (1960–61)
      that brought the struggle to different regions, and/or involved the UN in Cold War tensions.
      It would be valid for candidates to evaluate the different aspects of the crisis, for example
      Cuba (1962) and refer to the negative impact of brinkmanship or to the compromise
      reached over weapons in Cuba and Turkey. Other crises, like Hungary (1956) and Prague
      Spring (1968), provide an opportunity to evaluate the impact of steps taken by a
      superpower to deal with perceived challenges to their influence. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
