Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)
                                                 –4–                                      8823 – 5307M


1.   Warfare played a limited role in the maintenance and expansion of political
     organizations in pre-Columbian societies.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that warfare played a
     limited role in the maintenance and expansion of political organizations in pre-Columbian societies.
     Candidates may refer to societies with stable political organizations that maintained and expanded
     their systems not by war, but by building alliances and confederations. They may also consider the
     importance of putting new lands into production and trade relations to expand political
     organizations. Candidates may also discuss the role played by important leaders and religion in the
     maintenance of political organization and its expansion. Candidates may challenge the statement
     considering the examples of societies that competed for supremacy through warfare, like the
     Toltecs. They may also refer to the Aztecs that defeated the rival city of Azcapotzalco and
     emerged as the dominant force in central Mexico; or the Incas that conquered new lands and
     expanded their territories to the southern highlands. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
     disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

2.   Compare and contrast the relationship between man and nature in two indigenous societies.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the relationship between man
     and nature in two indigenous societies. Candidates may refer to the humanization of animals and
     plants, and the role they played in myths and history. They may also consider the strong link
     between religion and nature since many gods were represented as animals, plants, or atmospheric
     events. Also, the aftermath was usually represented with natural scenarios. Candidates may
     compare and contrast the way two societies ordered their activities according to the natural rhythm
     of agriculture and livestock. They can also refer to the indigenous knowledge about the
     pharmacological properties of plants, many of them used in rites and ceremonies, and the
     influence of nature in arts. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there
     does not need to be an equal number of each.

Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   “Indigenous labour had little economic benefit for European conquerors.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that indigenous labour
     had little economic benefit to European conquerors. Candidates may support the statement
     discussing that at an early stage of the conquest, European conquerors were more interested in
     the goods made of precious metals they could take from indigenous leaders. They may also
     consider that many indigenous communities were not easy to control and/or fled, preventing
     Europeans from benefiting from their labour, like in the South of the continent. Candidates may
     refer to the high mortality rates in the indigenous population that reduced their work capacity, and
     to the import of African slaves as a proof of the limited benefits the European had exploiting local
     communities. They may also consider the impact of some religious orders and royal laws that
     limited the exploitation of indigenous labour. Candidates may challenge the statement considering
     that Europeans did economically benefit forcing large groups of indigenous peoples to work in
     mines and lands and using them as artisans and personal serfs. Candidates may agree, partly
     agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.

4.   Evaluate the impact of conflicting land claims on European exploration in the Americas.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of conflicting land claims on exploration by
     European powers in the Americas. Candidates may evaluate the impact of the conflicting land
     claims in allowing or preventing the conquest and exploitation of new lands. They may consider
     those conflicts turned the navigation near some American coasts insecure, affecting trade. The
     conflicting land claims also had an impact on foreign relations involving new actors, such as in the
     case of the papal resolution to end the conflicts between Portugal and Spain. The conflicts around
     lands also impacted on indigenous populations, who suffered the consequence of wars.
     Candidates may also evaluate the consequences on local governments in the Americas, the
     control of ports and the increase of illegal trafficking. As examples, candidates may refer to the
     conflicts between Spain and Portugal, and Great Britain and France. While other relevant factors
     may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                    –6–                                        8823 – 5307M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the viceroyalty system in the Americas.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the viceroyalty system in America.
     Candidates may argue that the system of viceroyalty proved to be more effective than the previous
     system of audiencia, allowing for a better management and exploitation of the resources, and
     ensuring a better control of the gained lands against European competitors. The viceroyalty system
     was also effective in sending revenues to Spain, allocating lands for conquerors, and in the
     submission of indigenous communities. As failures, candidates may refer to the increase in the
     cases of corruption, malpractices and inefficiency that led to the Bourbon reforms. They may
     evaluate the case of the viceroyalty of Río de la Plata that was created to better control the region
     and stop the trafficking but its limited resources, as well as the limited perspectives of its authorities
     to get rich, worked against the Spanish control. As examples, candidates may also refer to the
     viceroyalties of New Spain, New Granada and Peru. While other relevant factors may be referred
     to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

6.   Evaluate the importance of gold, silver and sugar in colonial American economies.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the role played by gold, silver and sugar in colonial American
     economies. Candidates may consider that in the early decades, the extraction of metals was
     managed through the institution of encomienda. They may also consider that the discovery of
     important centres of gold and silver led to the introduction of capital and new techniques and
     machines in the Americas. This impacted on many indigenous communities who were reduced to
     the role of manual labourers. Regarding sugar, candidates may refer to its production in Brazil and
     in the Caribbean. In Brazil the first sugar plantation was established in 1518, and by the late 1500s,
     the country had become the leading supplier of sugar to the European markets. Soon, Barbados
     and a hodgepodge of British-, French-, and Dutch-controlled islands joined the market of sugar.
     Candidates may refer to the import of African slaves and their poor living conditions. They may
     also consider that the exploitation of gold, silver and sugar allowed for the creation of big fortunes
     in the hands of a number of families that acquired more lands and gained access to political
     positions. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
     the issue raised in the question.
                                                 –7–                                       8823 – 5307M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   Evaluate the cultural impact of the Catholic church in Spanish and Portuguese America.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the cultural impact of the Catholic Church on Spanish and
     Portuguese America. Candidates may consider that following the conquest, the papacy assumed
     responsibility for the organization of missions to evangelize. However, since it was embroiled in
     Italian politics, the papacy made a number of concessions to the crowns known as the “royal
     patronage”. The Catholic Church played an important role helping to submit and control indigenous
     communities. The church usually condemned indigenous authorities and their cultural practices.
     Candidates may examine the impact of the celebration of mass baptisms, the campaigns to
     extirpate the old gods, and the imposition of a new language. They may also consider the
     condemnation of local customs in the field of kinship, marriages, and the role of women that were
     seen as deviant or heretic and were banned in order to model the indigenous communities
     according with Catholic standards. Candidates may examine the ambivalent relation between the
     Catholic Church and slavery. While other relevant factors may be considered, the bulk of the
     response will remain on that/those raised in the question.

8.   “Jesuits actively collaborated with government authorities in the Americas.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that Jesuits actively collaborated
     with government authorities in the Americas. Candidates may support the statement stating the
     order was one of the principal agents of the Counter-Reformation. This was of help for the Church
     and government authorities, especially in North America. Candidates may refer to the
     evangelization campaigns undertaken by the Jesuits that taught the indigenous population to
     accept European authorities. Candidates may also reflect that the Jesuits’ travels helped to map
     the Amazon, western areas of North America and California, information that proved to be crucial
     for lay authorities. Candidates may challenge the statement considering the hostility against the
     Jesuits due to their defence of the indigenous populations against abuses. The order was also
     regarded as an impediment to the establishment of absolute monarchist rule. The Portuguese
     crown expelled the Jesuits in 1759, France made them illegal in 1764, and Spain and the Kingdom
     of the Two Sicilies took other repressive actions in 1767. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
     disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.
                                                    –8–                                        8823 – 5307M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Evaluate the effectiveness of the asiento system in the expansion of slavery.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the asiento system in the expansion of
      slavery. The asiento was an agreement between the Spanish crown and a private person or
      another sovereign power by which the latter was granted a monopoly in supplying African slaves
      for the Spanish colonies in the Americas. Candidates may argue that until the 18th century,
      Spaniards, Portuguese, French and British entered into such contracts, expanding slavery in the
      Americas. It is estimated that about 11.000.000 African slaves arrived alive in the Americas from
      the 15th century to 1807. Approximately 4.000.000 were sold to Brazil, and 2.500.000 to the
      Spanish colonies. Candidates may argue that the effectiveness of the asiento was many times
      jeopardized by wars and climate conditions that usually affected navigation. Also, the heavy
      taxation and government interference curtailed the profitability of asientos reducing        the
      effectiveness of the asiento and opening the path to illicit traffic. While other relevant factors may
      be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

10.   Evaluate the causes and effects of slave rebellions in British America.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the causes and effects of slave rebellions in British America.
      As causes, candidates may refer to the longing for freedom as the main reason for the rebellions,
      although in some cases slaves asked for limited goals such as better conditions or the possibility to
      work part-time. Some rebellions were also inspired by slave actions in other parts of the region,
      especially the Caribbean. Early abolitionists ideas also were reasons to challenge slavery.
      Candidates may also consider the impact of Christian religion and the idea that everybody is equal
      in the eyes of God. As effects, candidates may evaluate that most rebellions were short-lived
      disturbances that were defeated. Nonetheless, practices of resistance like running away or
      reducing the productivity of the work remained. In some cases, rebellions forced the masters to
      rearrange the organization of slaves, allowing for some improvements in their conditions. In others,
      the rebellions provoked the imposition of stricter slave codes. While other relevant factors may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                   –9–                                      8823 – 5307M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   Compare and contrast the causes of independence movements in two countries in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the causes of independence movements in two countries in the Americas. Independence
      movements could be the American Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, Mexican independence
      originating with Hidalgo, South American independence led by Bolivar and San Martin and
      Brazilian independence led by Dom Pedro. Similarities and differences will depend upon the
      independence movements chosen. Similarities could be a rejection of mercantilism, trade issues,
      taxation, lack of political rights, representation, social or racial inequality and the impact of
      Enlightenment ideas. Differences could be the level of control by the mother country, class rivalry,
      impact of other independence movements, and elimination of slavery. With each of the causes
      discussed, candidates should cite specific examples for the independence movements chosen.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each.

12.   “Enlightenment ideas played a limited role in the independence movements of the Americas.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that Enlightenment ideas
      played a limited role in independence movements in the Americas. Candidates may refer to the
      influence of the American revolution in the independent movements and its new constitutions. They
      may also state that independence was triggered by the desire to end the monopoly imposed by
      European crowns that limited the economic possibilities of the people in the region. Independence
      could also have been inspired by ideas forged by the local elites and/or indigenous communities.
      Candidates may discuss that independence movements could be triggered by the domestic
      conflicts the European metropolis underwent that showed they were incapable of controlling
      and defending their colonies. Candidates may challenge the statement considering that the ideas
      of freedom and rights from the Enlightenment were present in the Americas. They circulated within
      secret societies that played a major role in the independent movements. They can also refer to
      other ideas taken from the Enlightenment referring to economy, trade, education and social
      organization that influenced the independent movements. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   Discuss the reasons for major compromises and changes in the US political system up to 1840.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      major compromises and changes in the US political system up to 1840. Changes to the Articles of
      Confederation to the Constitution in 1787 were necessary to make the federal government more
      effective and many compromises were needed to gain its approval. The 1796 and 1800
      presidential elections indicated changes were needed resulting in the 12th Amendment, which
      altered the Electoral College process of electing the President and Vice-President. Candidates
      might refer to differing political visions as the reasons for the emergence of a two-party system by
      the late 1790s and the formation of new political parties. The expansion of voting rights and the
      admission of new states could be seen as reasons for the expansion of democracy and the growth
      of the nation. The compromise on the Assumption Bill of 1790 was necessary to placate differing
      views on the nation’s debt. Trying to keep a balance between free and slave states resulted in
      ongoing compromises over the admission of new states, the most important being the Missouri
      Compromise of 1820 which created the 36.30 line as the dividing line between free and slave
      states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

14.   “Caudillos were the biggest obstacle to the establishment of stable political systems in Latin
      America.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that caudillos were the
      biggest obstacle to the establishment of stable political systems in Latin America. Candidates may
      discuss that many caudillos refused to leave power, delaying the establishment of a stable political
      system. Since caudillos based their power in their charisma and personal relations, they hindered
      the establishment of a system based on elective authorities. Candidates may also consider that
      many caudillos were granted with emergency powers and opposed the drafting of a constitution
      that could have reduced them. Besides, caudillos were usually men with economic power, opposed
      to any change that could have affected their revenues. Candidates may challenge the statement
      stating that many caudillos were appointed as governors by the first parliaments, being part of the
      political system. They may also discuss other obstacles inhibiting the establishment of stable
      political systems such as the existence of different ideas for the organization of the new state,
      ongoing wars, the lack of resources, etc. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 8: US Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   Compare and contrast the resources of the North and South at the beginning of the Civil War.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the resources of the North and the South at the beginning of the Civil War. Candidates may choose
      to compare and contrast separately or they may do a running comparison between the two.
      Resources could be population, industrial output, infrastructure, financial strength, military strength
      and political leadership. Candidates may refer to Northern resources as larger population, greater
      industrial output, more railroads, an established military consisting of an army and a navy, and a
      solid government. Candidates may refer to Southern resources as King Cotton, military leadership,
      agreement as to reasons for war, and motivation to defend their way of life. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

16.   Evaluate the importance of African-Americans to the Union victory in the Civil War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of African-Americans
      to the Union victory in the Civil War. After the Emancipation Proclamation, many slaves left the
      plantations, decreasing economic output and weakening the Confederacy. Candidates might refer
      to the 180,000-200,000 African American troops that served in the Union forces , roughly ten
      percent of the total force. Though few saw battle, they performed many valuable jobs and freed up
      white soldiers from these tasks so they could fight. The most notable fighting unit was the 54th
      Massachusetts Infantry which saw action in South Carolina in 1863-64. Besides troops, several
      African Americans, most notably Harriet Tubman, served as spies for the Union. Candidates might
      argue that African-Americans had little to do with the eventual outcome as all major battles were
      conducted by white troops. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Evaluate the impact of railroad construction in two countries of the Americas.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of railroad construction in two countries of the
      Americas. Candidates may refer to the routes followed by the railroads according to              the
      economic activities in each country. They may also consider the impact the railroad had in the
      urbanization and in the foundation of new towns, helping to populate the country. Candidates may
      also consider that railroads allowed         governments to reach isolated regions, helping to impose
      the control of the state. They may also refer to the impact on the population: the need of workers
      for its construction, the possibilities to travel, the facilities to migrate, etc. The growth of the railroad
      also impacted in the economy allowing regional economies to put their product in a broad market,
      but also facilitated the import of industrial goods that affected artisan production. Candidates may
      also discuss the impact of the treaties signed between local governments and foreign capitals to
      build railroads. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

18.   “Political leaders achieved their political and economic aims in the transition to the modern era.”
      Discuss with reference to one leader in the Americas.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that political leaders
      achieved their political and economic aims in the transition to the modern era. Candidates may
      refer to examples of leaders that successfully achieved stable political systems with the
      establishment of democratic republics, and the signing of constitutions. They may also discuss the
      end of independence wars, and the set of stable borders. Candidates may also consider the
      establishment of the export-led model and/or the successful export of metals that allowed leaders
      to modernize the infrastructure of the country. Candidates may challenge the statement referring to
      the unstable democracies and the conflicts between political parties that affected the transition to
      the modern era. In some cases, the role played by the army also limited the possibilities of political
      leaders. Candidates may also discuss the lack of resources and the difficulties faced by many
      leaders to impose the control of the state throughout the country. The dependency on traditional
      economic activities could also be seen as a limitation. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   “US foreign policy towards Latin America between 1880 and 1929 was dominated by US
      expansionism.” Discuss.

      This question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that US foreign policy towards Latin America between 1880 and 1929 was dominated by US
      expansionism. While the US gained very little actual territory during this time, many candidates
      might refer to the expansion of US influence and control. Candidates may refer to the Spanish-
      American War, US post-war control of Cuba and acquisition of Puerto Rico, and involvement in
      Panamanian independence. They might also refer to Roosevelt’s Big Stick foreign policy, the
      Roosevelt Corollary, Taft’s Dollar Diplomacy and Wilson’s Moral Diplomacy. All three of these
      resulted in US military intervention in several Latin American nations. Candidates might indicate
      that President Cleveland in the 80s and 90s opposed US imperialism in the region, and the
      beginning of the Good Neighbor Policy in the mid-1920s. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

20.   Evaluate the factors that caused US entry into the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of the factors that
      caused US entry into the First World War. Candidates might refer to Germany sinking US ships
      with the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917 as the most important
      reason. Others might indicate economic motivations as paramount, indicating         that if the Allies
      lost, they couldn’t pay back all the loans/credit that had been extended. Candidates might discuss
      the Zimmerman Telegram, which invited Mexico to join the Axis powers and make war on the US,
      Wilson’s desire to be part of post-war peace negotiations, and a desire to help newly democratic
      Russia after the abdication of the Tsar. Others might refer to Wilson’s claims for the rights of
      neutral nations, for freedom of the seas and to make the world safe for democracy. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   “The Constitution of 1917 was more radical in nature than in application.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement that the Constitution of
      1917 was more radical in nature than in application. Most historians would agree that the
      Constitution of 1917 called for major social, political and economic changes in Mexico. The debate
      is over the institution of those changes. The Constitution guaranteed civil liberties, redistribution of
      land, protection of natural resources and       labor , education reforms and separation of church
      and state. Candidates might indicate that very few of these reforms were implemented in the
      immediate period, and those that were, were quite limited. Land reform was limited to small
      amounts and usually the least profitable land. Protection of natural resources was arguably the
      biggest improvement with the nationalization of oil. There was some success in education with the
      building of many schools and an increase in literacy, but parochial schools were closed and there
      was a shortage of teachers. Separation of church and state resulted in the Cristero War with many
      deaths and destruction. Politically, Mexico continued to be dominated by one party with severe
      limitations on civil liberties. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

22.   “The Mexican Revolution had a greater impact on Mexican arts and culture than on Mexican
      politics.”

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Mexican Revolution had a greater impact on the arts and culture of Mexico than on political
      change. Candidates might argue that the Revolution impacted many of the arts and changed the
      culture of Mexico. The Muralists, Rivero, Orozco and Siqueiros, emerged after the Revolution and
      portrayed the life of the average Mexican and of revolutionary leaders. Candidates might indicate
      that literary works focused on the course and impact of the revolution and highlighted what it meant
      to be Mexican. Music extolled the virtues of the revolution and its leaders. Led by Gamio, there
      was growth in awareness of indigenous peoples and their contributions. Education improvement
      was led by Vasconcelos. Candidates might refer to political change as the end of Diaz’ dictatorship
      and the creation of a constitution which promised to improve the lives of the average Mexican.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   “Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal eased the Great Depression, but did not resolve it.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement that FDR’s New Deal
      eased the Great Depression but did not resolve it. Candidates may refer to the vast spending and
      employment programs and to reforms instituted to end the Great Depression. The WPA, AAA,
      CCC and PWA all helped put people to work and reforms like the Banking Act, the FDIC and the
      SEC helped restore stability. But unemployment, which had been at nearly 25% in 1933 was still at
      19% in 1939. Bank failures decreased dramatically and confidence in the banking system was
      restored. However, the recession of 1938 indicated that the economy was still in peril and that
      government stimulus was still needed to promote recovery. GNP and employment levels did not
      reach their pre-depression levels until the middle of WW2, which many economists see as the
      eventual cure for the Great Depression. Candidates may refer to the increased military spending in
      preparation for war, but the time frame ends in 1939 and thus candidates should not be rewarded
      for any discussion of military spending and employment during the Second World War .
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

24.   Discuss the economic and social challenges of the Great Depression in one Latin American
      country.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the economic and social challenges
      posed by the Great Depression in one Latin America country. For the economic challenges,
      candidates may consider that regional economies followed an export-led model and were heavily
      trade-dependent which made them vulnerable to adverse conditions in the world market. The
      dependence of the public sector on foreign trade taxes was also a challenge. Latin American
      countries also suffered due to the US Smoot-Hawley tariff and Great Britain’s retreat behind a
      system of imperial preference that imposed        discriminatory tariffs on Latin America. The reduced
      foreign demand for Latin American goods caused gold and foreign exchange to flow out, causing
      internal deflation. The collapse of exports led to social challenges like the fall in employment,
      poverty and migrations from rural areas to the cities which were not capable of providing adequate
      accommodation. Candidates may also discuss the challenges faced by democracies under the
      Great Depression since the unstable situation provoked the increase in radical ideologies.
      Candidates may challenge the question arguing that some countries did not suffer a major financial
      crisis, and/or that the lack of imports allowed for an increase in the level of industrialization.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   To what extent did reactions in the Americas change towards the challenges presented by events
      in Europe and Asia between 1933 and 1945?

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the changes in
      the reactions in the Americas to the challenges presented by events in Europe and Asia.
      Candidates are likely to indicate that the reactions for most countries in the Americas changed
      from neutrality to involvement to some degree. Candidates may refer to initial reactions, to
      attempts to promote hemispheric cooperation through meetings at Panama, Havana and Lima.
      The US passed Neutrality Laws in 1935, ‘36 and ‘37 trying to stay out of war, but the Neutrality
      Law of 1939 allowed for the sale of weapons. The US and Canada formed a Joint Board of
      Defense. Candidates might indicate that Canada joined the war in 1939 and was heavily involved
      in securing the North Atlantic, while all other nations in the Americas remained neutral. The US
      began imposing sanctions on Japan in 1940 and increased them in 1941. The US made a bases
      for destroyers trade with Great Britain in 1940, enacted Lend-Lease and signed the Atlantic
      Charter in 1941. Candidates may refer to the US and Brazil agreement in 1941 to cooperate
      against the Axis, which allowed the US to build air bases       in Brazil and for Brazil to defend the
      South Atlantic. The US entered the war after Pearl Harbor and many Latin American nations did so
      in 1942. Argentina was pro-German until 1944. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

26.   Evaluate the economic impact of the Second World War on two countries in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic impact of the Second
      World War on two countries in the Americas. Economic effects may extend beyond the timeframe
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Answers will vary depending on
      the countries chosen, but nearly all countries in the Americas experienced economic growth during
      the Second World War. Candidates may choose any two countries, but likely choices could be the
      United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. Some effects could be increased GDP,
      higher employment rates, inflation, new industries, new technology, changing trade patterns and
      changes in government involvement in the economy.          Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   Discuss the reasons for the establishment of a dictatorship by the military in one Latin American
      country.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the establishment of a
      dictatorship by the military in one country. Candidates may refer to the role played by radical
      groups and guerrilla movements          that posed a challenge to democratic governments. They may
      also discuss the influence of the Cuban revolution that provoked the reaction of many national
      armies. Candidates may also refer to the influence played by the Western Hemisphere Institute for
      Security Cooperation (School of the Americas), that trained Latin American armies in counter-
      insurgence, like in Brazil, Chile and Argentina. They may also consider as a reason the economic
      crisis that led to destabilization of the democratic systems. The possibility of suffering a foreign
      invasion and/or the relation with the Soviet Union kept by non- aligned governments could also be
      a motive for the rise to power of military dictatorships. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

28.   “Foreign intervention played a significant role in the origins of guerrilla movements.” Discuss with
      reference to one country.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that foreign intervention
      played a significant role in the origins of guerrilla movements. Candidates may refer to the
      influence and intervention of the Communist bloc in Latin America that could have influenced the
      objectives, plans and strategies of the guerrilla movements. Candidates may also consider the help
      given to guerrilla movements by other foreign countries that provided training and ammunition.
      Candidates may also discuss that the intervention of Western powers was            seen as an intrusion
      in many countries, reinforcing the support given by the population to the guerrilla movements.
      Candidates may challenge the statements stating that many guerrillas arose as a consequence of
      local inequalities, while others had their roots in religious beliefs and/or had a strong ethnic identity.
      Many guerrilla movements were also the answer to the lack of freedom and democratic practices.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 18 –                                    8823 – 5307M


Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   “Kennedy was the first 20th century president to promote civil rights for African-Americans.” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement that Kennedy was the
      first 20th century president to promote civil rights for African-Americans. Several major civil rights
      events, such as Freedom Rides, integration at the University of Alabama, and the March on
      Washington occurred during the Kennedy administration. Candidates may refer to some of these,
      as well as his introduction of the Civil Rights Act. Some candidates may suggest that Kennedy was
      vocal in support of civil rights, but accomplished very little. Candidates might suggest Truman was
      first with his formation of a Commission on Civil Rights in late 46, his introduction of civil rights
      legislation in ‘48 and his integration of the Armed Forces by executive order in ‘48. Eisenhower
      could be discussed for his support of integration in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957 and passage of
      two civil rights acts. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

30.   To what extent were Pearson and Trudeau successful in resolving the disputes raised by Quebec
      nationalism?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the suggestion that Pearson and
      Trudeau were successful in resolving the disputes raised by Quebec nationalism. Quebec
      nationalism grew much stronger in the 1960s and both prime ministers were forced to deal with the
      issue. Candidates might indicate that Pearson formed the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and
      Biculturalism to search for solutions. Under Trudeau, Canada officially became bilingual and all
      government agencies had to work in both languages. More French speakers were appointed to
      federal positions. Candidates might refer to the October Crisis of 1970, when Trudeau used the
      War Measures Act to send troops to Montreal to arrest separatists. The referendum for separation
      in 1980 was defeated, while the Constitution of 1982 and the Charter of Rights alleviated some of
      the nationalists’ issues. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 19 –                                    8823 – 5307M


Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Evaluate the impact of McCarthyism on the domestic and foreign policies of the United States.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of McCarthyism on the
      domestic and foreign policies of the United States. McCarthyism grew in the US in the early 1950s
      and its influence was felt in many areas. Candidates may refer to the House Un-American
      Activities Committee’s investigations, in which many Americans were accused of being
      communists. They may also consider the hysteria McCarthyism created across the country and the
      increased fear of the Soviet Union’s reach. Candidates may refer to the impact on the
      entertainment industry with suspected communists losing their jobs, and the production of patriotic
      and anti-communist movies. Regarding foreign policy, candidates might suggest that US entry into
      the Korean War was a result of McCarthyism, though this is debatable. Most of Truman’s foreign
      policy decisions, and later Eisenhower's, were the result of the containment policy more than
      McCarthyism. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

32.   “The Cold War had limited impact on the foreign policy of countries in the Americas.” Discuss with
      reference to one country in the Americas (except the US).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Cold War had limited impact on the foreign policy of one country in the Americas,
      excluding the US. Depending on the country and the time period chosen, responses will vary
      widely. Candidates may discuss Canada as being strongly impacted as it was a close          US ally, a
      member of NATO, participated in the Korean War and made joint defense agreements with the US.
      However, Canada was not supportive of the Vietnam War nor the US’ strong stance against Cuba.
      For most Latin American countries, excepting Cuba, candidates are likely to agree with the
      statement, despite the Rio Treaty of 1947 and the later formation of the OAS. Most Latin American
      countries sought to have foreign policies that would not anger the US. Cuba, post-Batista, is the
      exception. The Cold War had a great impact on Cuba         with its alliance with the USSR, the Bay
      of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis and its exportation of the revolution.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   Discuss the challenges and achievements of civil rights movements for indigenous peoples in the
      Americas.

      The question requires candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the challenges and
      achievements of civil rights movements for indigenous peoples in the Americas. Candidates may
      refer to one or two countries in depth, or in a broader sense to several countries in the region.
      Challenges may pre-date the time frame but they must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of challenges and achievements, or they may
      prioritize their examination of one of the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Challenges will vary, but candidates could include oppression by the national
      government, racial and ethnic discrimination, low socio-economic status and limited access to
      media and power. Civil rights could include voting, legal, education and economic rights, as well as
      restoration of lost lands, sovereignty over their affairs and support of their culture. For the US,
      candidates might include the formation, actions and accomplishments of the American Indian
      Movement. For Canada, they might discuss the accomplishments of First Nations, Inuit and Metis,
      and for Mexico, they might discuss the achievements of the National Zapatista Army. The UN’s
      Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007 could be addressed. Candidates' opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

34.   “Local and state governments undermined the progress made by the federal government in
      securing African-American civil rights.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that state and local governments undermined the progress made by the federal government in
      securing African-American civil rights. Candidates might refer to progress by the federal
      government as Supreme Court decisions such as Brown vs Topeka Board of Education,
      Congressional legislation like the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of
      1965, as well as passage of the 24th Amendment, and presidential actions in Little Rock in 1957,
      in protecting Freedom Riders and in forcing states to end segregation in universities. Candidates
      might argue that states did very little to require adherence to Supreme Court decisions or enforce
      civil rights legislation, and often worked in opposition to them. Likewise, cities did little to prevent
      discrimination in public places or in housing, while local school boards often redrew school
      boundaries to maintain segregation. State and local law enforcement often did not protect African-
      Americans from white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, of which some law enforcement
      officials were members. Candidates might argue that institutional racism permeated all levels of
      society effectively denying African-Americans their civil rights. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   Discuss the reasons for, and impact of, economic cooperation in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and impact of, economic cooperation in the Americas. Causes may predate the time frame and
      impact may extend beyond, but both must be clearly linked to the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of reasons for and impact of, or they may prioritize one or the other, but both
      aspects will be included in their response. Candidates may refer to a desire    to stimulate
      economic growth and regional trade, to offset gains made by nations outside the region and to
      promote regional cooperation as reasons for economic cooperation. Major trade agreements such
      as NAFTA and CAFTA as well as other smaller regional trade agreements, whether bilateral or
      multilateral, could be discussed. Candidates might see both positive and negative impacts of
      regional economic cooperation. Positively, candidates might argue that NAFTA and other regional
      trade agreements resulted in massive trade increases, higher productivity and higher GDPs.
      Negatively, candidates might suggest that this cooperation has cost jobs in some countries,
      caused industries to relocate and created ethnic resentment. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

36.   Evaluate the impact of 9/11 (the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001) on the region.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of 9/11 (the attacks on the US on 11 September
      2001) on the region. Candidates may argue that, after the attacks, budgets for defence-related
      agencies skyrocketed in most countries. There was also a growth in government surveillance. In
      the US there was an increase in the number of soldiers deployed overseas, and in 2002 the Bush
      administration opened the Guantanamo Bay detention centre in Cuba. Also, in many countries
      Arab and Muslim populations were under scrutiny or were deported, raising serious civil rights
      concerns. Candidates may argue that the general rules of transportation of people and products
      underwent a series of major overhauls. The attacks also impacted foreign relations, especially
      with a number of countries out of the Americas that were seen as enemies. The attacks also
      provoked the signing of new treaties and pacts to protect the region. In Latin America a number
      of countries and borders were seen as a threat, especially in Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, and
      the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. While other relevant factors may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
