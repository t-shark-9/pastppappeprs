2.   Alejandro’s Aerial Photography (AAP)

     Alejandro Tovar owns Alejandro’s Aerial Photography (AAP) as a sole trader. He currently
     rents a helicopter on a monthly basis but would like to purchase a professional industrial
     drone to take his aerial photographs. The bank requested a cash-flow forecast and approved
     a $15 000 loan for Alejandro to purchase the drone. Alejandro will be able to purchase the
     drone in December 2023, and he will take delivery of the drone at the end of February 2024.
     At the start of March 2024, Alejandro will start to take aerial photographs using the drone.

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Anna’s pet salon

     In 2024, Anna Holborn plans to start a new business: a pet
     grooming salon. Although Anna has no managerial experience,
     she is eager to work for herself. In Anna’s city, three pet salons
     already exist. The market is very competitive.

                        Table 3: Selected data on the three existing pet salons

           Salon            Prices            Reputation out of           Independent or
                                              four stars (★)              franchise

           A                Medium            ★★★                         Franchise

           B                Low               ★                           Independent

           C                High              ★★                          Franchise

     Anna is considering two options for opening her salon:
     y Option 1: Open it as an independent business, called AH Salon.
     y Option 2: Open it as a franchise of Paws Boutique (PB), a nationwide chain of pet grooming
       salon franchises that currently has no franchise in Anna’s city.
                 Table 4: Anna’s forecasted initial costs of starting a pet salon as an
                  independent business (Option 1) or as a PB franchise (Option 2)

                                         Option 1: As an             Option 2: As a PB
                                         independent business        franchise

               Equipment                 $15 000                     $12 000

               Grooming supplies         $10 000                     $10 000

               Initial local promotion   $5000                       $2000

               Legal fees                $2000                       $4000

               Purchase of franchise     Not applicable              $10 000

               Total                     $32 000                     $38 000

     If Anna buys a PB franchise, she must pay 5 % of revenue to the franchiser. The franchiser
     will pay for regional and national – but not local – promotion. Anna must purchase equipment
     from the franchiser. In other cities, PB franchises are rated medium in terms of price and ★★
     in terms of reputation.
     Anna has limited financial resources. She has prepared a forecast for the first year. She
     forecasts, as a PB franchise, an average of 200 pet grooming services per month at a price
     of $30. As an independent business, she forecasts that sales would be 10 % lower. For both
     options, fixed costs, including her salary, would be $2800 per month. Variable costs would be
     $5 per pet grooming.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   Define the term variable costs.[2]

     (b)   Using Table 3, construct a product position map/perception map of the three existing
           pet salons.                                                                              [4]

     (c)   Explain two problems that Anna may encounter when starting a new business.               [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether Anna should open her pet salon as an independent business
           (Option 1) or as a PB franchise (Option 2).[10]

4.   WindJam (WJ)

     In 1998, major camping equipment manufacturers considered eco-friendly products a niche
     market. Cameron Harris saw an opportunity, however, and founded WindJam (WJ), a private
     limited company that manufactures eco-friendly camping equipment. Cameron owned 100 %
     of WJ’s shares. WJ’s vision statement is, “Promoting environmental experiences while
     protecting the environment.”

     WJ’s eco-friendly camping equipment is expensive. Since 1998, the popularity of eco-friendly
     products increased, and WJ’s sales have grown every year.

     In 2014, WJ sold new shares to family members. With a long working capital cycle and
     increasing sales, WJ needed more working capital. This need was heightened when one
     supplier reduced its credit terms from 60 days to 30. The funds from the sale of the new
     shares increased WJ’s working capital. Cameron now owned 70 % of WJ.

     Initially, WJ faced limited competition, but the market began to change. Many large
     manufacturers are now developing eco-friendly camping equipment. Some large
     manufacturers use a loss leader pricing strategy, whereas other large manufacturers use a
     penetration pricing strategy. One competitor has also offered tents at prices that, Cameron
     suspected, were lower than production costs.

     In 2023, WJ must compete more effectively. Cameron has two options:
     y Option 1: Convert WJ to a public limited company, which could raise $10 000 000. With
        additional finance in the form of a bank loan, this amount would be enough to build a modern,
        sustainable factory and fund additional working capital. Cameron’s ownership of the company
        would fall to 30 %.
     y Option 2: Outsource all manufacturing to developing countries, where costs are lower. The sale
        of WJ’s existing factory could be used for additional working capital.

     (a)   Define the term niche market.[2]

     (b)   Explain why WJ regularly needs more working capital.                                        [4]

     (c)   With reference to WJ’s new competitors, explain the terms “penetration pricing” and
           “loss leader”.                                                                              [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether Cameron should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]

5.   Mattie Eats (ME)

     Mattie Eats (ME) is a small fast-food chain selling a range of products. Between 2017 and
     2021, ME expanded into small local towns.

               Table 5: Information on ME’s core products in the local fast-food market

     Year of     Core product            Other information about the product and the markets

     2017        Traditional beef        Was very profitable. Currently has a low market share
                 burgers                 in a declining market. It is a loss-making product. Social
                                         marketing by the government reduced demand.

     2018        Roasted organic         Currently very profitable, with a high market share. Market
                 potatoes                growth is low.

     2019        Low-fat, 100 %          Was a very successful product. Has a high market share,
                 organic beef burgers    but the market is maturing/saturating rapidly. The product
                                         breaks even.

     2020        Vegan* burgers          A commercially successful product. Has a high market
                                         share in a mature/saturated market. Profit is levelling off.

     2021        Vegan pancakes          Has a very low market share in a highly mature/saturated
                                         market. It has not been a commercial success.

     Overall ME has been profitable, but its profits started to fall in 2020. The chief executive
     officer (CEO) is concerned about the future.

     The competition in the vegan fast-food industry is intense. Consumers see the products as
     undifferentiated and demand value for money. Last year, ME increased its above-the-line
     promotion to attract more customers.

     In 2024, ME will launch a 100 % vegan drink aimed at health-conscious consumers. A loss
     leader pricing strategy will be used.

  dairy, and eggs

     (b)    Using the Ansoff matrix, explain two of ME’s growth strategies.                                [4]

     (c)    Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for ME of using a loss leader pricing
            strategy for the new product that will be launched in 2024.                                    [4]
