1.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text A — Costa Rica: Economic growth and development strategies

     1   In the early 1990s, Costa Rica, a Central American country with a population of approximately
         5 million people, was considered an economic development success story. This stable
         democracy has experienced consistent economic growth (approximately 4 % annually) for the
         last 20 years. Some experts say this has been due to moving from a failed import substitution
         policy to outward-oriented economic policies. The outward-oriented policies included export
         promotion, diversification, trade liberalization and inward foreign direct investment (FDI). During
         the same period, social and environmental policies were implemented. Public education and
         healthcare were guaranteed for all citizens, social programmes were improved to include
         extensive transfer payments and minimum wages were increased. This helped the reduction
         in absolute poverty rates and Costa Rica became known as a global leader in environmental
         conservation efforts.

     2   The Dominican Republic–Central America–United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR),
         was a significant move towards trade liberalization. In addition to reducing trade barriers, it
         established a secure and predictable environment for foreign investors. This agreement also
         led to the breakup of the state-owned monopolies in the telecommunication and insurance
         industries in Costa Rica. Additionally, trade agreements with Canada, China, the European
         Union (EU), Mexico, Peru and Singapore were established.

     3   Costa Rica encouraged inward FDI by lowering regulations and providing tax incentives
         in manufacturing industries. In 1997, Intel, a large multinational tech company from the
         United States (US) invested US$300 million in building a computer parts factory. Intel’s
         investment helped diversify Costa Rica’s main exports away from coffee and bananas to
         electronics. Moreover, the FDI allowed Costa Rica to benefit from production externalities,
         as multinational companies provided training to local employees. Manufacturing and services
         overtook agriculture in terms of contribution to gross domestic product (GDP), and Costa Rica
         experienced its first trade surplus in 50 years. The increase in real GDP from the FDI was
         significant, as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) was 0.8 at the time.

     4   To promote diversification, export subsidies for companies in the manufacturing sector were
         granted. Agricultural diversification was also encouraged through subsidising farmers who
         were adopting new technology to produce higher value-added products, such as roasted
         coffee beans.

(Question 1 continued)

Text B — Current concerns

   1   Despite earlier successes, income inequality in Costa Rica has remained high and poverty
       levels have remained unchanged for several years. This has been blamed on insufficient
       transfer payments due to a tax system that is not progressive enough and tax exemptions
       offered to foreign firms. Unemployment has consistently risen, and despite high levels of
       spending in education, a significant number of young people have not completed secondary or
       higher education. The focus on higher value-added sectors did not create jobs for low skilled
       workers, which had a disproportionate impact on women and youth. Additionally, the social
       programmes have often failed, and still fail, to reach the very poor.

   2   High social and environmental spending, large increases in public sector wages, and insufficient
       revenue have resulted in very large government (national) debt. Most of the debt is domestic,
       which is raising concerns about possible crowding out.

   3   FDI has historically supported economic growth, however, domestic investment and further FDI
       have slowed down due to rising costs and outdated infrastructure. Additionally, the appreciating
       colón (Costa Rica’s currency) has lowered export competitiveness, and Costa Rica remains
       heavily dependent on one major trading partner, the US.

Text C — “Green Trademark” environmental policy

       The “Green Trademark” policy has reversed deforestation and has resulted in Costa Rica
       becoming one of the countries with the greatest level of biodiversity in the world. However, it is
       difficult to maintain the environmental focus due to pressure on government resources and the
       high opportunity costs associated with land use. The consistent economic growth has made
       it difficult for Costa Rica to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Increasing urbanization
       and the growth in the manufacturing sector have increased air and water pollution. Moreover,
       the overuse of chemicals in farming has caused river pollution, and the intensive use of land for
       agriculture has generated concern for environmental conservation.

2.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text D — Overview of Cambodia

     1   Between 2010 and 2019 Cambodia had one of the fastest growing economies in Southeast
         Asia. Most of the growth was driven by tourism, exports of garments and improved
         consumer confidence.

     2   However, despite high economic growth, rural poverty has persisted, and inequality has grown
         within rural populations. Approximately 90 % of workers are employed in the informal sector and
         access to quality healthcare and education remain a challenge for Cambodia. Youth (under 25
         years old) make up a large proportion of the labour force, but many do not complete secondary
         school. As a result, those entering work are under-skilled and human capital is low. Access
         to clean water and sanitation facilities is still lacking. Export-driven growth is being threatened
         as the European Union (EU), which accounts for 30 % of Cambodia’s export market, recently
         ended a preferential trade agreement and will now impose tariffs on Cambodian products, such
         as garments.

     3   Experts state that the focus on growth through garment manufacturing is unsustainable. The
         garment industry, which is the largest informal employment sector, has been criticised for poor
         working conditions and pay. Even workers who are formally employed can barely meet basic
         needs, despite the recent minimum wage increase and introduction of a price ceiling on rents
         for housing in cities. Additionally, there are reports of pollution and water waste generated by
         garment factories, damaging the health of those who live nearby.

     4   To help solve the market failure in the garment industry, economists recommend that the
         government should support projects that encourage garment factories to adopt a circular
         economy approach, either in partnership with worldwide clothing brands or by forming social
         enterprises (SEs) locally. The circular economy approach can help reduce environmental
         waste that occurs during production by encouraging the recycling and reusing of materials.
         Developing ecotourism has also been recommended to support sustainability and provide new
         job opportunities for the youth and the rural population. Furthermore, ecotourism could help
         Cambodia benefit from growing world income levels.

     5   Reforms in the garment and tourism industries are needed, along with improvements in
         infrastructure, to maintain sustainable growth and competitiveness. Promoting entrepreneurship,
         developing new skills and increasing the use of technology would help solve current labour
         market needs.

(Question 2 continued)

Text E — Social Enterprise (SE) in Cambodia

   1   When Cambodia’s status changed from low income to lower middle-income in 2015, the inflow
       of foreign aid decreased dramatically. As a result, SEs became increasingly more important in
       promoting Cambodia’s economic development. Furthermore, SEs were seen as a key factor in
       breaking the poverty cycle and providing opportunities for its young labour force. SEs may also
       encourage local investment, which has experienced very slow growth compared to foreign direct
       investment (FDI).

   2   Many SEs focus on addressing issues of poverty, child rights, education, disability, health and
       environmental concerns. The main beneficiaries are children, youth, women and people with
       disabilities. Successful Cambodian examples include Phare Performing Social Enterprise
       (PPSE), which is a performing arts school targeting underprivileged children. Most graduates
       become full time workers at PPSE. Another example is Hydrologic, which provides affordable
       safe water options to rural households. New SEs are currently being established to ensure
       sustainability within the growing ecotourism industry.

   3   However, challenges exist within the SE sector. Less than 8 % of SEs are formally registered
       due to bureaucracy and high taxes. This limits access to potential investors and markets and
       encourages businesses to stay in the informal sector. New SE start-ups often fail due to lack of
       sufficient funding and the inability to attract skilled labour.

Text F — Microfinance in Cambodia

       Since 1991, Cambodia has had one of the fastest growing microfinance sectors in the world.
       Microfinance has helped decrease poverty in rural areas and solve asymmetric information in
       the market for loans. However, key issues have persisted, including low success rates of some
       businesses due to inadequate financial literacy and expertise. Additionally, microfinance has
       become increasingly dependent on funding from international banks and investors, resulting in
       higher interest rates. Some borrowers have been forced to sell their land as they could not meet
       their debt repayment obligations. Recently the government implemented a price ceiling on the
       interest rate for loans in rural areas to help prevent increasing household indebtedness.
