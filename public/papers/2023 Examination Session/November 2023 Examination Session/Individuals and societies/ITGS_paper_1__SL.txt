Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Smart lamp posts

     The city of Hong Kong, in China, has installed smart lamp posts (see Figure 1). The lamp
     posts include LED lighting, sensors that monitor the environment, and cameras that take
     images of the surrounding area. The data collected is transmitted to a data centre that is part
     of a cloud computing network. This is part of a strategy to use digital technologies to improve
     the physical quality of life.

                                       Figure 1: A smart lamp post




           [Source: © Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. GovHK (www.gov.hk).]

     (a)   (i)     Identify two sensors the smart lamp posts could use.                                         [2]

           (ii)    Outline one reason why encryption is used to transmit the data from the smart
                   lamp posts to the data centre.                                                               [2]

           (iii)   Outline one reason the Hong Kong authorities are using cloud computing to store
                   the data collected by the lamp posts.                                                        [2]

     (b)   Explain three technical requirements that will need to be met to enable the smart lamp
           post system to function effectively.                                                                 [6]

     (c)   To what extent will the introduction of smart lamp posts lead to an improvement in the
           environmental conditions within a city?                                                              [8]
                                                    –3–                                           8823 – 5512


2.   No more snow days

     Around the world, extreme weather can prevent schools from opening. Examples of extreme
     weather include snow in Canada, rain in Oman, and typhoons in Japan.

     In 2020 and 2021, many schools implemented a distance learning programme so they did
     not need to add days to the school year to make up for lost learning. Schools were given
     funding to upgrade their information technology (IT) infrastructures so students and staff
     would be able to study and work from home.

     Some schools have used this funding to introduce a virtual private network (VPN), and others
     have used it to increase their cloud computing capability.

     Students and staff are required to agree to an acceptable use policy before they are allowed
     to access a school’s network.

     With the movement towards online learning, teachers have also been asked to teach
     synchronously and asynchronously.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two types of software required for distance learning.                        [2]

           (ii)    Identify two reasons why a school would introduce an acceptable use policy.           [2]

           (iii)   Outline one advantage for users if a school introduces a virtual private
                   network (VPN).                                                                        [2]

     (b)   Two strategies for distance learning are synchronous teaching and asynchronous teaching.

           Analyse these strategies.                                                                     [6]

     (c)   Many schools are considering moving to a one-to-one mobile device programme where
           each student has access to one device.

           Two options for implementing a one-to-one mobile device programme are:
           y schools owning devices that are issued to students
           y students owning their own devices and using them in the school (also called a
             bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy).

           Evaluate these options.                                                                       [8]




                                                                                                  Turn over
                                                   –4–                                            8823 – 5512


3.   Digital documentation

     Governments currently use paper documents, such as a passport or driving license, to
     authenticate a citizen’s identity.

     Some governments, however, are allowing citizens to create a digital ID that they can use as
     proof of identity. This digital ID can be securely stored in a digital wallet app* on smartphones
     and other digital devices (see Figure 2).

                                      Figure 2: Using a digital ID




     Some governments are also considering extending their digital services and moving
     them completely online. These services could include digital medical records, digital tax
     information, digital driving licenses, and digital car registration documentation.

(Question 3 continued)

     One proposal is to store this data in a relational database. Figure 3 shows part of the
     relational database.

            (iii)    Outline one advantage of using a relational database instead of a flat file
                     database to store the data collected by the government.                              [2]

            (iv)     Describe the difference between identification and authentication.                   [2]

     (b)    The development of digital services will require policies for the collection, storage and
            sharing of data.

            Explain how a government and the developers of its digital systems can ensure that the
            privacy of citizens is not compromised when data is collected, stored and shared.             [6]

     (c)    Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for the citizens of a country if the
            government moves its services online.                                                         [8]




                                                                                                   Turn over

4.   Workforce monitoring

     Amy Davies is a programmer working for SaskWater. Recently, she has been working from home.

     During the first few weeks of remote working, Amy noticed that new software had been
     installed on her laptop. The software was monitoring her daily tasks and the time she was
     spending on them.

     One of the applications checks that Amy is moving her mouse or carrying out an action. If
     she fails to do this for more than 15 minutes, an alert is sent to her supervisor informing her
     that Amy is not working (see Figure 4).

                               Figure 4: Alert sent to Amy’s supervisor




                                   You have not been active
                                        for 15 minutes.

                                   Your supervisor has been
                                          informed.

(Question 4 continued)

     At the end of each month, managers at SaskWater are sent a report that shows the number
     of times each employee has generated an alert. This information is stored in a spreadsheet
     (see Figure 5).

                     Figure 5: Number of alerts sent to employees in August 2023

     Amy has discussed this with some of her colleagues. She is concerned that all employees
     may have this software installed on their laptops. She has described this software to her
     colleagues as spyware.

     (a)   The URL for SaskWater is: https//www.saskwater.com/index

           (i)     State the protocol.                                                                 [1]

           (ii)    State the domain name.                                                              [1]

           (iii)   State the formula used to calculate the total number of alerts sent.                [1]

           (iv)    State the EmployeeID that would appear in the second row of the spreadsheet if
                   the alerts were sorted in descending order.                                         [1]

           (v)     Identify two other ways in which SaskWater could monitor its staff.                 [2]

     (b)   (i)     Distinguish between the way monitoring software and spyware gather information.     [2]

           (ii)    Explain two reasons why a spreadsheet was chosen to store and manage the
                   information about alerts.                                                           [4]

     (c)   To what extent is it acceptable for employers to use monitoring software on their
           employees’ work laptops?                                                                    [8]
