           to [2].


     (b)   Identify two benefits for staff at the Geneva MCA Sports store from the introduction of
           customer service robots.                                                                      [2]

           Answers may include:
           • Staff will not spend time on simple inquiries that are repetitive.
           • Staff do not need to spend time showing customers where items are.
           • Staff will be engaged in more complex tasks which will make their work more
              interesting.
           • Staff will not need to know all the different languages commonly spoken in
              Geneva.
           • Staff can be replaced while they are taking a break.

           Note to Examiners: It should be noted that this answer may implicitly refer to the

2.   Explain three concerns André has about integrating the new in-store technologies with the
     existing radio frequency identification (RFID) stock management system (lines 68–69). [6]

     Answers may include:

     Technological concerns
     • Compatibility/interoperability/different protocols
     • The new system may not be compatible with the existing systems and may not be able to
        effectively communicate with it.

     •   Hardware capacity
     •   Ensuring the existing hardware e.g., processing speed, storage can handle the additional
         technologies.

     •   Network capacity
     •   Ensuring the network can accommodate the increase in data that is being collected and
         shared between the different technologies.

     •   Adequate bandwidth
     •   Whether the bandwidth can cope with the amount of data collected by the AI and processed in
         the cloud

     •   Managing different suppliers
     •   Different products come from different suppliers - that may need to work together / different
         levels of support /installation.

     •   Data integrity
     •   if the robot/app is not updated they cannot be used effectively.

     •   Data Security
     •   Concern about the effective sharing of data between stock management system and the new
         technologies

     Note to examiners:
     Privacy is not a concern specific to the integration with the stock management system.

Staffing concerns
• IT support/maintenance
• IT support staff will need to be experts in each of the technologies. More staff may be required
    to support and maintain these new technologies in addition to the existing system.

•   Time and expense of training for IT staff
•   IT staff will need training in how to maintain each of the new technologies, which will take time
    and be costly.

•   Time and expense of training for retail staff
•   Retail staff will need training in how to use and interact with each of the new technologies,
    which will take time and be costly.

•   Staff resistance to change
•   Not all staff will embrace each of these technologies, depending on how the technology
    impacts their role in the company.

Note to examiners:
Privacy is not a concern specific to the integration with the stock management system.

Award [1] for each concern Andre has about integrating the new in-store technologies with the
existing radio frequency identification (RFID) stock management system and [1] for each
development up to [2].


Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

3.   The four new technologies implemented in the Geneva MCA Sports store have the potential to
     considerably increase the quantity of data collected from customers.

     To what extent is the increased quantity of customer data beneficial for the managers of the
     Geneva store (lines 73–76)?                                                                       [8]

     Answers may include:

     How the data can be used by the managers
     • Smart Shelves can gather information about customer behaviour, which can be used by the
       managers to optimize the layout of the store.
     • Smart shelves can collect data about behaviour e.g., how long a user hovers at a place, can be
       used to help with pricing decisions which will increase sales.
     • Augmented reality mirrors can collect information to determine which stock preferences are
       more popular e.g., choice of colours tried vs purchased can help guide what stocks to increase.
     • Data can be used to help personalize a shopping experience e.g., customer service robot
       greeting the customer by name, making suggestions of alternative purchases and improving the
       reputation of the store and or encourage customers to return, hence increasing store profits.
     • Data can be used to learn more about their customer, to improve the shopping experience
       regarding their likes and dislikes based on their behaviour in the store, which can attract more
       customers.

     Concerns for the store manager due to the collecting of data
     • The store manager will need to meet data protection regulations, which requires an expert to
       monitor and advise Madeleine.
     • How will the store manager ensure the customers are aware of the data collected.
     • How will the store manager obtain consent? Will the store allow customers to opt out? and if so,
       how does this impact the usefulness of the technologies?
     • To be compliant with data protection, the store manager will need to justify the data stored is not
       too excessive and will not be kept longer than necessary.
     • The store manager will need to work with IT staff on:
         o Managing storage requirements for the amount of data.
         o Security measures to protect the data.

4.   Madeleine believes the four new technologies being implemented in the Geneva MCA Sports
     store will bring people back into the physical stores. Carol disagrees and believes that the
     solution is to provide a unique in-store experience for the customers through high-quality
     customer service.

     To what extent do you agree with Madeleine?                                                     [12]

     Answers may include:

     Reasons why technology will bring people into the store
     • The technology can help enrich customers’ knowledge about what they are purchasing using
       the in-store app.
     • The technologies can be fun and a novelty, providing an enjoyable experience for reluctant
       shoppers.
     • Easier ability to try clothes on using the augmented reality mirrors.
     • Increased efficiency of smart shelves means that the store is better stocked.
     • Robots are able to address customers in a range of languages.
     • No need to try on clothes (faster, more hygienic, correct sizing)
     • Better service tailored to customer needs due to stored customer preferences.


     Reasons why technology might not bring people into the store
     • The novelty of the store will not be long term.
     • Not all customers will want to interact with the technologies.
     • Natural language processing may not be sufficiently developed for all nationalities.
     • The level of AI in the technologies may still not be sophisticated enough to provide expert
       advice.
     • Who has access to their data (shopping preferences, clothes size, personal details), how is their
       data secured, if they no longer wish to shop at MCA is their data deleted?


       Reasons why customer service will bring people to the store
     • Service staff can provide a more personal touch for the customers, perhaps knowing them by
       name and remembering conversations from past purchases.
     • Service staff can be knowledgeable about the products and share this in an appropriate manner
       e.g., at the right level depending on the customers age, race, gender.

     Reasons why customer service will not bring people to the store
     • Not all customers want to be helped when shopping, especially if they know what they want to
       buy.
     • There may not be enough shop floor staff with the right level of knowledge to help.
     • Customers may still prefer the online experience as they don’t need to physically visit the store
       and items can be delivered.
