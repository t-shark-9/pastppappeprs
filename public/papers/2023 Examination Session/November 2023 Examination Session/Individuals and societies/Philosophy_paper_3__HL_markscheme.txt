How to use the Diploma Programme Philosophy markscheme

The assessment markbands constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment markbands examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the assessment markbands listed on page 6.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to
emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills referred to in the various
assessment markbands published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement with philosophical
activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing responses, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme:

• The Diploma Programme Philosophy course is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy
  in the candidates. These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment markbands in the
  subject guide
• The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct answer
• The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
• The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list but rather an indicative list where they might appear in the answer
• If there are names of philosophers and references to their work incorporated into the markscheme,
  this should help to give context for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such
  philosophers and references should appear in an answer: they are possible lines of development.
• Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
• Examiners should be aware of the command terms for Philosophy as published on page 54 of the
  Philosophy subject guide when assessing responses
• In markschemes for Paper 3, there are suggested pertinent points found in the text extract relating to
  philosophical activity. The markschemes include suggested questions that might stimulate analysis of
  those points. It is not intended that all possible points raised by the text are to be covered by the
  candidates. The markbands direct examiners to rewarding the responses accordingly
• The markscheme bullet points cannot and are not intended to predict how a candidate will relate his
  or her personal experience of the DP HL Philosophy course to the text extract, so the examiner must
  be aware that much of the response of the candidate will not be covered by material in the
  markscheme; but the candidate’s response must relate to the text extract.

       • The response is poorly structured, or where there is a recognizable structure there is
         minimal focus on the task. Philosophical vocabulary is not used, or is consistently used
         inappropriately.
       • There is a very basic understanding of the view of philosophical activity raised by the
  1–5
         unseen text. Few, if any, references are made to the text.
       • There is limited reference to the student’s personal experience of philosophical activity but
         no comparison or contrast of this experience with the view(s) raised by the text.
       • The essay is descriptive and lacking in analysis. Few of the main points are justified.
       • There is some attempt to follow a structured approach although it is not always clear what
         the answer is trying to convey.
       • There is a limited understanding of the view(s) of philosophical activity raised by the text.
         Few, if any, references are made to the text.
       • There is some evidence that the student has drawn on their personal experience of
  6–10   philosophical activity.
       • The response identifies similarities and differences between the student’s personal
         experience of philosophical activity and the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the
         text, although the analysis of these similarities and differences is superficial.
       • The response contains some analysis but is more descriptive than analytical. Some of the
         main points are justified.
       • There is a clear attempt to structure the response, although there may be some repetition
         or a lack of clarity in places. Philosophical vocabulary is used, sometimes appropriately.
       • There is a satisfactory understanding of the view(s) of philosophical activity raised by the
         text. Some references are made to the text.
       • There is some evidence that the student has drawn on their personal experience of
 11–15   philosophical activity, with examples or illustrations used to support their points.
       • There is some analysis of the similarities and differences between the student’s personal
         experience of philosophical activity and the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the
         text, although this analysis needs further development.
       • The response contains critical analysis rather than just description. Many of the main points
         are justified.
       • The response is well organized and can be easily followed. Philosophical vocabulary is
         used, mostly appropriately.
       • There is clear identification of the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the unseen
         text. Some references are made to the text.
       • The student draws on their personal experience of philosophical activity, using examples or
 16–20   illustrations to support their points.
       • There is clear analysis of both similarities and differences between the student’s personal
         experience of philosophical activity and the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the
         text, although this analysis needs further development.
       • The response contains critical analysis rather than just description. Most of the main points
         are justified. The response argues to a reasoned conclusion.

Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

When responding to this extract candidates should focus on the activity of philosophy. In the course of
analysing and evaluating the ideas in the extract candidates should reflect on their own experience of
doing philosophy and should therefore make explicit comparisons/contrasts between their experience
of studying the HL Philosophy course and what the extract is saying about doing philosophy.
Candidates should make explicit reference to the ideas and arguments in the text in their response. [25]

Responses are expected to explore the reflection on philosophy as a venture in rational enquiry. Since
philosophy is characterized as a potentially many-sided activity the reflection on doing philosophy may
be identified in different ways. Some responses might explore the implications of doing philosophy
because philosophy differs from most other subjects they have encountered in their studies. Whereas
other responses might take some of the different routes offered by the philosophy programme when
explaining the nature of the subject: philosophy as a systematic critical inquiry into profound, fascinating
and challenging questions (What is it to be human? Do we have free will? What do we mean when we
say something is right or wrong?). Candidates might explore aspects of their philosophy course in areas
such as the core theme, epistemology and Plato’s Republic. Responses might also defy the text as a
whole by assessing the idea that there is no alternative to philosophizing. Further, responses might
make other references to the parts of the HL programme which relate to the passage, eg: practical
rationality and ethics, philosophy of religion or political philosophy.

Candidates might consider the following:
• The extent to which the mission of philosophy is to provide a basis for understanding the world and
  our place within it as intelligent agents. Possible different views according to traditions and positions
• The ways in which the world might be understood
• Non-rational approaches as a way of philosophizing, eg: Scheler, Sidgwick
• The experience of learning and doing philosophy and the mission of philosophy as providing
  orientation for conducting intellectual and practical affairs
• The central role of rationality for Plato and Descartes
• The question of the adequacy of the relationship between method and mission
• Possible aims of philosophical activity stemming from the experience of studying the HL course and
  general experience
• The means to accomplish philosophy as a project: observation, exploration, and evaluation
• Different approaches and goals of philosophy: to energize action, to nurture aspiration, to clarify
  thinking, to enhance knowledge, to improve living
• Mind and body; some philosophers are concerned primarily for the body (eg: Nietzsche) and some for
  the intellect or the spirit (eg: Plato)
• The extent to which understanding ourselves is common to the various philosophical objectives
  presented
• Philosophy as a journey in question-resolution – an activity addressing the traditional “big questions”
  about ourselves and our place in the world’s scheme of things
• The development of understanding as a matter of rational enquiry
• The opposition between very different ways of doing philosophy and its characterization by one main
  defining objective
• The diversity of philosophical methods. Plato and the Republic, Descartes and Meditations
• Philosophy as a rational activity and the methodologies of the sciences
• The relation between theoretical and practical reason
• Approaches to reason and criticisms of rationality, eg: the feminist critique of the idea of reason in
  Alison Jaggar
• The place of philosophy within human evolution
• The extent to which there is no alternative to philosophizing as long as we remain in the domain of
  reason
• Non-western traditions or ways of philosophizing

• The extent to which the various issues and approaches of the philosophical inquiry can be covered by
  the ways of doing philosophy shown in the text, eg: Nietzsche’s, Nussbaum’s or Singer’s central issues
  and approaches
• How candidates themselves have experienced the way in which the act of refusing to philosophize is
  seen as actually philosophizing
• Philosophy as being a search for the meaning of life.
