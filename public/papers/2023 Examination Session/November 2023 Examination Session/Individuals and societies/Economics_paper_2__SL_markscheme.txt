Notes for examiners:

1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.
2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.
3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to
2 dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may
only be penalized ONCE per question (not per part) for each type of error.

 1.   (a)   (i)    Define the term floating exchange rate indicated in bold in the text (Text A,
                   paragraph 3).                                                                       [2]

                       The idea that it is a currency/exchange rate that
                       fluctuates/changes.

                       A clear understanding that it is an exchange rate that is
                       determined by market forces (without intervention).

            (ii)   Define the term carbon taxes indicated in bold in the text (Text B, paragraph 3).   [2]

                       The idea that they are taxes levied on carbon emissions
                       (carbon content of fuel) OR that they help the environment or
                       reduce pollution (address market failure).

                       A clear understanding that they are taxes levied on carbon
                       emissions (carbon content of fuel) to reduce external
                       costs/protect the environment (they are Pigouvian taxes).

(b)   (i)    Using information from Text C, paragraph 2, calculate the percentage change in
             quantity demanded for public transport in Poland’s capital city if the ticket price is
             reduced from 4.40 zloty to 4.00 zloty.                                                   [3]

             % change in ticket price = -0.4/4.4 × 100 = -9.09 (OR -9.0909)

      (ii)   Using information from Table 1, calculate Poland’s real central bank interest rate
             in 2020.                                                                                 [2]

              For a correct AD/AS diagram with appropriate labelling, showing
              AS shifting upwards and a rise in the price level OR for an
              explanation that the excess demand/shortages in the labour
              market will result in either:
               • wages increasing which will raise costs (of production)
                  OR
               • a reduction in production
              leading to a fall/shift left of AS and resulting in a rise in the price
              level/inflation.
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.              3–4

              explanation that the excess demand/shortages in the labour
              market will result in either:
               • wages increasing which will raise costs (of production)
                 OR
               • A reduction in production
              leading to a fall/shift left of AS and resulting in a rise in the price
              level/inflation.

          Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].




      For an AD/AS diagram, the vertical axis may be Average (General) Price Level or Price
      Level or CPI. The horizontal axis may be real output, real national output, real income,
      real national income, real GDP or real Y. All abbreviations are acceptable. A Keynesian
      AS curve is acceptable. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using an exchange rate diagram, explain the possible effect of different relative
      inflation rates in Poland and the EU in 2021 on the exchange rate of the zloty
      (Text A, paragraph 2).                                                                   [4]

      1       There is a correct diagram OR an accurate written response.           1–2
              For a correct exchange rate diagram with appropriate labelling,
              showing demand shifting left and the exchange rate decreasing
              OR for an explanation that (relatively) higher inflation in Poland
              makes Polish exports less competitive in foreign markets, which
              will decrease the demand for zloty on the foreign exchange
              market, leading to a fall in the exchange rate/depreciation.
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.          3–4
              For a correct exchange rate diagram with appropriate labelling,
              showing demand shifting left and the exchange rate decreasing
              AND for an explanation that (relatively) higher inflation in Poland
              makes Polish exports less competitive in foreign markets, which
              will decrease the demand for zloty on the foreign exchange
              market, leading to a fall in the exchange rate/depreciation.

      Alternatively, candidates may consider that imported goods may become more
      competitive than domestically produced goods and this may result in an increase in
      the supply of zloty. If appropriately explained and accompanied by a diagram
      illustrating an increase in supply, this approach can be fully rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].




      The vertical axis may be exchange rate, value/price of zloty in another currency,
      other currency/zloty or other currency per zloty. The horizontal axis may be quantity
      or quantity of zloty. All abbreviations are acceptable. A title is not necessary.

(e)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain how the Polish central bank’s monetary policy may
      affect the inflation rate (Text A, paragraph 2).                                          [4]

              AD shifting left and a fall in the price level OR for an explanation
              that higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing (or
              increase the return to saving) which leads to less
              consumption/investment and therefore reduces AD which
              decreases the price level resulting in less inflation.
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.           3–4
              For a correct AD/AS diagram with appropriate labelling, showing
              AD shifting left and a fall in the price level AND for an
              explanation that higher interest rates increase the cost of
              borrowing (or increase the return to saving) which leads to less
              consumption/investment and therefore reduces AD which

(f)   Using a demand and supply diagram, explain how a tax on cars in Poland provides
      tax revenue (Text B, paragraph 3).                                                        [4]

              labelling, showing the supply shifting left and the tax revenue
              OR an explanation that (as the tax raises costs) the supply
              decreases, causing the price to rise and tax revenue to be
              obtained.

              AND an explanation that (as the tax raises costs) the supply
              decreases, causing the price to rise and tax revenue to be
              obtained.

      The vertical axis may be price or P. The horizontal axis may be quantity or Q. A title
      is not necessary.

      Candidates may indicate the tax revenue with shaded areas or numbers/letters in
      the diagram (eg ‘area ABCD’). Some candidates may show two tax revenue boxes
      with an increase in tax revenue due to the tax being raised. This should be fully
      rewarded, if appropriately explained.

Answers may include:
• Definition of growth
• Definition of sustainable/sustainability
• An externalities diagram
• A PPC diagram
• An AD/AS diagram.

Ways in which growth does not conflict with environmental sustainability:
• growth of GDP/capita is high and with higher incomes people often become more
  environmentally conscious (Table 1)
• positive and growing balance of trade surplus means that cleaner technology can be
  imported (Table 1; Text A, paragraph 3)
• population is declining leading to less pressure on resources (Table 2)
• inequality is relatively low (small and decreasing Gini coefficient) and therefore more
  carbon taxes can be applied (Table 2)
• the HDI level implies that the population is educated and healthy, with rising life
  expectancy (Table 2)
• increased R&D and training will improve both growth and the environment, if new
  technologies are implemented (Text A, paragraph 4; Table 1)
• programmes to increase renewables and decrease emissions are being
  implemented (Text B, paragraph 1)
• a small decrease in the use of fossil fuels to produce energy (Table 2)
• can achieve both growth and sustainability with increased government spending
  (Text B, paragraph 2)
• improved public transport will improve the environment while also increasing growth
  through better infrastructure, productivity and mobility (Text C, paragraph 2).

Ways in which growth does conflict with environmental sustainability:
• increased GDP/capita leads to more spending on cars and electricity (Table 1;
  Text C, paragraph 1)
• carbon dioxide emissions per capita have risen (Table 2)
• budgetary constraints in the future mean less government expenditure available for
  environmental projects (Text A, paragraph 1)
• still very dependent on fossil fuels to produce energy relative to the EU (Text A,
  paragraph 5)
• relatively many deaths due to air pollution (Text A, paragraph 5)
• an ageing population may be less environmentally conscious (Text A, paragraph 1)
• specialized in low and medium technology, therefore high-tech products that are
  better for the environment have to be imported (Text A, paragraphs 3 and 4)
• a lack of training for labour and low spending on R&D make it difficult to implement
  clean technology (Text A, paragraph 4; Table 1)
• dependence on coal-fired power plants, which have high negative externalities
  (Text A, paragraph 5; Table 2)
• extra carbon taxes and other measures to improve environment may affect lower
  income households adversely and increase inequality (Text B, paragraph 3)
• it is difficult to encourage people, who prefer cars as a luxury good when their
  income rises, to switch to public transport (possibly seen as an inferior good) due to
  low PED (Text C, paragraphs 1 and 2).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
appropriate, should be rewarded.
