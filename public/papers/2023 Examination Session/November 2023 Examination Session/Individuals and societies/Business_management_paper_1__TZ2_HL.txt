                                               Section A

Answer two questions from this section.

1.   (a)	Outline two reasons why BRD may have chosen external growth rather than internal
          growth for its expansion (lines 27–28).                                                          [4]

     (b)   Explain how Arnold’s relationship with BRD’s employees may have affected productivity
           at BRD (lines 58–72).                                                                           [6]


2.   (a)	Outline two ways in which BRD could change its marketing mix when it switches to
          making model trains with plastic rather than metal in 2024 (lines 108–110).                      [4]

     (b)   Explain the likely impact on BRD of changing from batch production to cellular
           manufacturing (lines 41–56).                                                                    [6]


3.   (a)	Outline two types of secondary market research that BRD could have used to identify
          the reasons for the decline in sales of model train sets and plastic model kits
          (lines 114–115).                                                                                 [4]

     (b)   Explain the likely impact on BRD of selling additional share capital to solve its liquidity
           problem (lines 124–141).                                                                        [6]
                                                   –3–                                            8823 – 5011


                                              Section B
Answer the following question.

4.   BRD manufactures model train sets using just-in-case (JIC) stock control. Every December,
     sales of model train sets are usually equal to three months of production. BRD has 300
     limited-edition train sets, made in 1999 to mark the turn of the millennium, in stock.

     High-quality packaging is a feature of BRD train sets. BRD is considering buying packaging
     from GXG in Germany. In 2024, BRD plans to make 100 000 train sets. BRD will use the data
     in Table 1 to make a decision about whether to continue to make its own packaging or buy
     packaging from GXG.

                        Table 1: Forecasted costs for BRD to make its own
                              packaging or buy packaging from GXG

          Packaging unit variable cost       £0.55           Order quantity        Unit price

          Packaging total fixed costs     £5000              0–75 000              £0.70

                                                             75 001–90 000         £0.66

                                                             90 001–105 000        £0.56

                                                             105 001+              £0.50

     BRD uses a cost-plus (mark-up) pricing strategy for its Matchfix plastic model kits. Price
     increases of plastics and electricity have reduced profit margins.

     In 2022, 180 000 Matchfix plastic model kits were made and sold at £80 each. Unit variable
     costs were £75, and total fixed costs were £800 000. The percentage share of unit variable
     costs per Matchfix plastic model kit is shown in Figure 1.

(Question 4 continued)

     BRD’s board of directors are considering two options to improve the profit margins of its
     Matchfix plastic model kits: installing solar panels on its factory roof to generate electricity or
     outsourcing the production of the Matchfix plastic model kits.

     Option 1: Install solar panels on the factory roof to generate electricity
     Costing £2 572 763, the installation would reduce BRD’s annual Matchfix production line net
     electricity bill by 75 %. Last year’s bill was £1 350 000. BRD forecasts electricity prices to
     increase by 10 % per year until 2034. The forecasted savings are shown in Table 2.

                       Table 2: Forecasted net annual electricity savings from
                              solar panel installation (all figures in £s)

                                         Year 2         1 225 125

                                         Year 3         1 347 638

                                         Year 4         1 482 401

                                         Year 5         1 630 641

     Option 2: Outsource the production of Matchfix plastic model kits
     BRD is negotiating with VKI, a manufacturer in China, to produce and supply the plastic
     model kits for five years. In the first year, VKI’s price would be 25 % lower than BRD’s current
     production unit cost. Thereafter, the price would rise by 10 % each year.

     (a)   Define the term cost-plus (mark-up) pricing.                                                     [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for BRD of using just-in-case (JIC)
           stock control for the manufacture of its model train sets.                                       [4]

     (c)   (i) 	Calculate the difference between the cost for BRD to make its own packaging
                 and the cost to buy the packaging from GXG (show all your working).[3]

           (ii)   Suggest one factor, other than cost, that BRD should consider before deciding
                  whether to make its own packaging or buy packaging from GXG.                              [1]

     (d)   Using information from the case study and the additional information above,
           recommend whether BRD should choose Option 1 (install solar panels) or
           Option 2 (outsource production).                                                               [10]
                                                   –5–                                           8823 – 5011


                                               Section C
Answer the following question.
5.   It is now November 2023, and BRD’s board of directors did not approve the installation of
     solar panels nor the outsourcing of the production of the Matchfix plastic model kits.
     4Change now owns 45 % of BRD’s shares and wants to make strategic changes.
     BRD’s board of directors are considering two strategic options: a location and product
     change, suggested by the 4Change board members, or the repurposing of unused factory
     space for a visitor centre, suggested by other board members.

     Option 1: A location and product change, suggested by the 4Change board members
     y Sell BRD’s Liverpool factory, which is valued at £28 million. BRD is valued at £24 million.
     y Relocate to a factory nearby at an annual rent of £2 million and setup costs of £1.5 million.
     y End the production of BRD’s model train sets. A retailer in India has offered £3 million to
       purchase BRD’s stocks of model train sets, valued at £10 million, along with the brand name,
       BRD Three-Rail Model Railway.
     y Launch a new two-rail model train set with a new brand name, BRD 21st-Century Trains.

     Option 2: Repurposing unused factory space for a visitor centre, suggested by other
     board members
     y Two possibilities have been proposed for the visitor centre:
          y A railway museum showcasing full-sized railway engines and rail cars from the 20th century.
          y A science and imagination centre with interactive exhibits, allowing families to experiment
             with wind, magnets, electricity, and light. Highly trained employees would be needed to
             assist with experiments.

                          Table 3: Forecasted costs for the visitor centre

                                 Setup costs                   £900 000

                                 Annual total variable costs   £100 000

                                 Annual total fixed costs      £150 000

     Total costs are forecasted to rise by 10 % each year.

     The entrance fee to the visitor centre would be £15 per adult, with accompanied children
     entering for free.

                 Table 4: Forecasted numbers for paying visitor centre customers

                            Year         Paying visitor centre customers

                            1            40 000

                            3            55 000

                            4            59 000

                            5            63 000

(Question 5 continued)

      BRD’s board of directors are divided. Arnold, who is in his final year as chief executive officer
      (CEO), has drawn up a force field analysis of both proposed options, shown in Table 5.

      All figures are based on Arnold’s personal opinions.

      Using the case study and the additional information on pages 5 and 6, recommend whether
      BRD should choose Option 1 (location and product change) or Option 2 (repurpose unused
      factory space).                                                                                     [20]
