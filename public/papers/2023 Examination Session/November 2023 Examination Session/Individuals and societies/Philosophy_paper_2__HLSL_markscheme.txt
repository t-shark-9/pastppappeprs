Candidates who overlook the Paper 2 rubric of answering both parts a and b of one question

However clearly the IB sets out its expectations on how candidates should answer exam questions,
there are occasions when we receive work that does not match what we asked for. There is a specific
case in exams where we ask students to select particular questions to answer and they fail to follow
these rules (rubrics).

This note is intended to clarify how we deal with these situations through a series of scenarios.
The actions have been checked to ensure that they are supported by RM Assessor.

Overarching principles
The following statements underpin our decisions below:
   1. No candidate should be disadvantaged for following the rules.
   2. Whenever possible candidates should receive credit for what they know.


Example
To help understand the different scenarios we will make reference to an example assessment.
Instruction: candidates must respond to both parts of one question.
Q7. (a)     Explain Mill’s view of the relationship between liberty and utility.                (10 marks)
      (b)   To what extent are liberty and utility fundamentally conflicting concepts?          (15 marks)


Q9. (a)     Explain the view that morality has a clear and traceable genealogy.                 (10 marks)
     (b)    To what extent do you agree with the genealogy Nietzsche proposes?                  (15 marks)

Scenario 1. Candidate answers parts from two different questions.
Example: Candidate answers 7(a) and 9(a) or answers 7(b) and 9(a)
Action:
Mark all of the candidate’s answers. The student will receive their best mark from one question.
In the second example this means the best mark for either 7(b) or 9(a).
This requires that examiners assign each mark to the correct question part (ie gives the mark for 9(a) to
9(a) and not 7(a) – if question is QIGed this will happen automatically).

Scenario 2. Candidate does not split their answer according to the sub-parts.
Example: Candidate writes one answer which they label as question 7 or they indicate they have only
answered 9(a) but actually answer both 9(a) and 9(b) in that answer.
Action:
Examiners use their best judgement to award marks for all sub-parts as if the candidate has correctly
labelled their answer.
In the example this means the candidate would be able to gain up to 25 marks despite only labelling the
answer as 9(a).
                                                 –4–                                      8823 – 5602M


Exception – where the nature of the two parts of the question means it is important to differentiate
between the two answers, for example the first part should be done before the second part (in
maths) or the candidate needs to show they understand the difference between the two parts of the
question then examiners should use their judgement and only award marks if it is clear that the
candidate has simply made a mistake in numbering their answers.
                                                   –5–                                        8823 – 5602M


Scenario 3. Candidate duplicates their answer to the first part in the second part.
Example: Candidate answers 7(a) and the repeats the same text as part of 7(b)
Action:
Only give credit for the answer once (in the first part of the question). The assessment criteria should
assess distinct skills when there are parts to a question so this problem should not occur.


Scenario 4. Candidate provides the wrong question number for their answer.
Example: Candidate states they are answering 7(a) and 7(b) but their response clearly talks about
Nietzsche (Q9) rather than Mill’s (Q7).
Action:
Mark the answer according to the mark scheme for the question that they should have indicated.
Exception – this only applies when there is no ambiguity as to which question the student has
attempted, for example if they have rephrased the question in their opening paragraph. It is not the role
of the examiner to identify which question is the best fit for their answer (ie which questions their answer
would get most marks for). If the given question number is a plausible match with their answer then the
student should be marked according to that question. Only in exceptional circumstances should this rule
be applied to sub-questions (ie assuming the candidate had mistakenly swapped their answers for Q7(a)
and Q7(b).

How to use the Diploma Programme Philosophy markscheme

The assessment markbands constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment markbands examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the assessment markbands listed on page 8 for part A responses,
and page 9 for part B responses.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to
emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills referred to in the various
assessment markbands published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement with philosophical
activity throughout the course.
As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing responses, the following points should be kept in mind
when using a markscheme:

• The Diploma Programme Philosophy course is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy
  in the candidates. These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment markbands in the
  subject guide
• The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct answer
• The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
• The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list but rather an indicative list where they might appear in the answer
• If there are names of philosophers and references to their work incorporated into the markscheme,
  this should help to give context for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such
  philosophers and references should appear in an answer: they are possible lines of development.
• Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
• Examiners should be aware of the command terms for Philosophy as published on page 54 of the
  Philosophy subject guide when assessing responses
• In markschemes for Paper 2 there is a greater requirement for specific content as the Paper requires
  the study of a text by the candidates and the questions set will derive from that text. The markscheme
  will show what is relevant for both part A and part B answers. In part B responses, candidates may
  select other material they deem as relevant
• Responses for part A and part B should be assessed using the distinct assessment markbands.


Note to examiners

Candidates at both Higher Level and Standard Level answer one question on the prescribed texts.
Each question consists of two parts, and candidates must answer both parts of the question
(a and b).

Simone de Beauvoir: The Second Sex, Vol. 1 part 1, Vol. 2 part 1 and Vol. 2 part 4

1.   (a)   Explain the idea that woman is “a womb, an ovary”.                                           [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the idea that woman is “a womb, an ovary”.                                          [15]

     The opening chapter of The Second Sex explores the biological basis of womanhood. It starts with
     the idea that woman is “a womb, an ovary”. De Beauvoir concludes that biological facts are
     extremely significant because they will determine how a woman perceives and experiences the
     world. However, those biological facts do not determine a fixed destiny or justify why women are the
     Other, and they do not condemn women to be forever under subordination. This quote highlights
     the existentialism in de Beauvoir’s thinking: that we see the world through our own personal
     circumstances, but also that we can shape our place in it. Furthermore, it highlights the importance
     of the question. She points out that there is no getting away from biological facts, that these
     necessarily shape the lives people are able to live. This is reflected in her detailed exposition of the
     reproductive basis of sex in different animals and in humans.

     Candidates might explore (part A):
     • Examples from the text about different animals eg: termites
     • The broader relationship between biology and social identity as discussed throughout the book
     • De Beauvoir’s existentialism, the idea that one is not born a woman but becomes one
     • The role of reproduction to women and to men
     • The claim that from the onset of a woman's puberty to menopause, she is the stage for a
       narrative that happens within her, but is not necessarily about her as an individual
     • The relationship between reproduction and other themes in the book such as work,
       relationships, psychoanalysis, sexuality, and the sense of Otherness
     • The role of male biology in determining womanhood eg: the fact that de Beauvoir depicts men
       as active agents in reproduction and women as passive objects
     • The difference between sexual identity in the natural world, and sex and gender for men and
       women in society.

     Possible discussion points include (part B):
     • The extent to which women are determined by their biology
     • Whether the detailed explication of sex and reproduction in the natural world is useful when
       talking about women
     • How far the fact that we see the world through our bodies means that our reproductive biology
       determines what we see
     • Whether society and biology can be separated
     • The extent to which being a woman is determined by society, eg: Haslanger’s (2000) definition
       of gender in terms of how society views individuals as opposed to biological facts
     • The relationship between society and reproduction
     • If woman is ‘a womb, an ovary’, then how can the sexual hierarchy that they are subjected to be
       eradicated?
     • Whether biology leads to subjugation
     • Childbearing and whether this limits women’s roles in society
     • How far men’s views about women’s sexuality and biology are responsible for problems that
       women face
     • Changes to the role of women as a result of advances in contraception eg: the pill
     • Whether technological advances such as artificial wombs could play a role in fighting women’s
       subjugation, whether there are elements of a woman’s biology which ought to be celebrated and
       supported
     • The politics of surrogacy, and the potential exploitation of women’s bodies for money

• An assessment of whether de Beauvoir’s claim that “her body is something other than her”
  could lead to an excessively negative attitude to sexuality or body image. This could be linked to
  eg: body positivity movement
• Whether de Beauvoir’s understanding of gender and the body is compatible with transgender
  identities.

2.   (a)   Explain the view that work is a complex issue for women.                                  [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that work is a complex issue for women.                                 [15]

     De Beauvoir describes work as a complex issue for women. On the one hand, through work
     women have bridged the gap that has separated women from men. Through work women are able to
     guarantee their freedom. On the other hand, de Beauvoir sees work in a nonsocialist system as
     inherently exploitative. She argues that in a non-socialist system, work is enslaving, it is not
     freedom; only in a socialist system are women guaranteed freedom through work. De Beauvoir
     describes a tension between feminists and anti-feminists about work, where the former overstate
     the achievements of emancipated women and are overlook their frustrations, while the latter
     argue that liberated women achieve little of significance, and have difficulty finding an inner
     equilibrium. De Beauvoir is sympathetic towards both positions. She thinks that the world of work
     forces women to occupy traditionally masculine roles whilst still pressuring them to keep up
     feminine standards such as personal appearance and maintaining the home. This leads to a
     tension where women want to live as both male and female, which results in the burden of work
     and fatigue to multiply. Coupled with the impossibility of being independent during motherhood
     where “even one child is enough to entirely paralyse a woman’s activity” de Beauvoir makes a
     case for being skeptical about the ability of work to free women.

     Candidates might explore (part A):
     • De Beauvoir’s claims about socialism
     • The relationship between female biology and the world of work
     • The claim that “her femininity leads her to doubt her professional judgement” where de Beauvoir
       explains that women are brought up to believe that their abilities are limited
     • The view that work can lead to independence
     • De Beauvoir’s aim in Part 4 of the book of discussing women’s liberation and the idea of the
       independent woman
     • Why de Beauvoir thinks that without socialism, workers are always exploited
     • The claim that the world of work is suited to men because “his vocation as a human being in no
       way contradicts his destiny as a male”
     • The relationship between childbearing and work
     • The idea that women are under pressure to be both feminine and masculine at once if they are
       to enter the world of work successfully
     • The constant tension between professional and sexual vocations for an independent woman.

     Possible discussion points include (part B):
     • Whether work has proved more liberating for women since The Second Sex was published than
       de Beauvoir thought was possible
     • An evaluation of socialism eg: through exploring Adam Smith’s account of the free market, or
       Marxist perspectives
     • De Beauvoir’s criticism of Engels’s view
     • A discussion about the role and value of state intervention to support women in the workplace
       eg: maternity pay, the use of quotas to select job candidates, subsidized child care
     • Norms surrounding childcare and the unrecognized work of women in the home
     • The role of men when it comes to supporting independent women
     • Whether a working woman sacrifices “finding her balance” if she chooses independence
       through work
     • Whether it is still true that “the world has always belonged to men and still retains the form that
       they have imprinted on it”
     • The idea that patriarchy is damaging to both men and women and that changes to the world of
       work might benefit both genders
     • Whether it is still true that “the world has always belonged to men and still retains the form that
       they have imprinted on it” eg: Perez’s book ‘Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World
       Designed for Men’ arguing about biased measures to assess human standards taking the male
       as example and standard
     • The relationship between gender equality and socialism.

René Descartes: Meditations
3.   (a)   Explain Descartes’s analogy of the piece of wax.                                           [10]

     (b)   Evaluate Descartes’s analogy of the piece of wax.                                          [15]

     This question seeks an explanation of Descartes’s analogy of a piece of wax. In the Second
     Meditation Descartes tries to resolve the issue of the nature of the physical world and the mental
     world and the role of the mind. He suggests that the mind can perceive the actual essence of
     things and can ‘see’—understand—things beyond the physical. The analogy uses a piece of bee’s
     wax which is solid, and then when exposed to heat it changes its consistency: from solid to liquid,
     from something which had a distinct smell and taste to a tasteless flexible substance. Yet
     Descartes claims that we as observers still know the substance to be bee’s wax because our mind
     has gone beyond what we physically sense—sense data—to understanding the very nature of
     wax. He then goes further with another illustration of people in a road being seen as moving hats
     and coats, yet the observer knows them to be people. Descartes is trying to show that humans can
     go beyond sensory experiences to knowing and understanding, because of the actions of the
     mind. He shows in the analogy that the senses might confuse the perceiver, yet our intellect can
     resolve this confusion as we have a mind that comprehends the fundamental properties of, in the
     analogy, wax—the extension, flexibility, and changeability of the wax, and so it is the mind that
     processes information and imposes meaning. The true nature of the wax “is perceived by the mind
     alone”. The analogy demonstrates the ability of the intellect to perceive independently of the
     imagination and other mental attributes. Descartes then moves on to apply this awareness of the
     role of the mind to his own identity in that if he is aware of his perceiving and understanding,
     interpreting—if he knows he is thinking—he can relate knowing/thinking to proving his own
     existence. Candidates might make mention of Sartre’s later arguments of his existence related to
     surroundings and physical objects, and Searle’s comparisons between human thinking and
     computer activity. Candidates might also question Descartes’s reliance on ‘clear and distinct
     ideas’, and his aim to try to establish ‘undeniable truths’. Challenges to the validity of the analogy
     might be presented from the perspective of doubting the claims that arise from the analogy as to
     whether one can doubt the cogito, as the whole argument could be tautological and that thinking,
     or cognitive activity, can occur in many forms, such as doubting and judging.

     Candidates might explore (part A):

4.   (a)   Explain the difference between imagination and intellect.                                   [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the difference between imagination and intellect.                                  [15]

     This question seeks an explanation of how Descartes differentiates between the imagination and
     the intellect. For Descartes, imagination is not seen as a creative activity, but the sense of
     perceiving or imaging something. The explanation can be drawn largely from the Sixth Meditation
     but can also come partly from the First Meditation. Descartes uses the distinction between
     imagination and the intellect to suggest that his substance theory establishes the idea that the
     mind and body are separate. The imagining of sensations received through the body is the action
     of imagination, while the effective process of the intellect is the looking at the actions of thinking
     and confirming the existence of a separate substance, the mind. Physical objects which are
     determined by laws, are quite separate from the mind, which is non-extendable (not existing in
     space and time). He claims that he is aware of imagining, imagination, because the intellect ‘sees’
     it is happening. Consequently, imagining is a thinking activity but at a low level. He claims that the
     link between the mind and body, the former mental and the latter physical, like a ‘pilot of a ship’.
     There is a difference between a captain and pilot. However, his argument seems unconvincing
     when it comes to explaining quite how the ‘pilot’ works and is located, seemingly in the pineal
     gland, which is by definition physical. He also reinforces the argument for the difference between
     the imagination and the intellect by referring to mathematical figures. He uses the triangle to show
     that humans can imagine objects, while when referring to a chiliagon (a thousand-sided figure) he
     suggests that because it is such a complex figure it cannot be imaged but only encountered by the
     intellect which reflects upon its properties. This he parallels to how humans can reflect upon their
     own mind and its properties using the intellect. There are still elements of doubting in his argument
     as with the use of imagination, as the imaging of sensations seems only to suggest a possibility of
     physical world. In contrast the intellect can establish more certainty because it is dealing with what
     he refers to as ‘clear and distinct ideas’.


     Candidates might explore (part A):
     • ‘Clear and distinct ideas’ which are certain and encountered by the intellect
     • Imagination, with the aid of intuition, can image objects in the ‘mind’s eye’
     • The limitations of imagination compared to the intellect; imagination could be vague and
       imprecise
     • The uniqueness of imagination to use a facility different to that of understanding which might be
       outside the mind “turns toward the body, and contemplates in it some object conformed to the
       idea which it either conceived of itself or apprehended by sense”, whereas the intellect, the act
       of understanding, is the mind ‘turning on itself’
     • The analogy of the ‘pilot in the ship’
     • Descartes’s views on physics and the nature of physical objects which he explores in other
       writings
     • Whether activities such as interpretation and judgment also have a role in defining both the
       mind and a world picture
     • Alternative sources that create experiences introduced by Descartes are God and angels, and
       actual objects in nature. God and angels cannot deceive and be as uncertain as imagination.
       Similarly actual objects in nature could have a causal act and have more validity than the
       imagining, because they appear without the use of my will
     • Whether it is the case that it is both senses and mental interpretation that clarify our perceptions
       of the world.

     Possible discussion points include (part B):
     • Descartes’s arguments from the imagination and the senses are supposed to show that his
       intellectual faculties seem to be linked to something outside of the mind. While his argument
       from the imagination only leaves the existence of body as a reasonably good guess, his
       argument from the senses leaves him ultimately satisfied

• The problem of ‘imagining’ sensations, which might not be within the ‘body’ and these then have
  ‘secondary qualities’, relying on senses—sense data—which Descartes had questioned in
  earlier Meditations
• Can any certainty be achieved because of the weakness of Descartes’s argument? He himself
  refers to imagination as ‘only probably’ and ‘only suggesting’ an external physical world
• Is it justified to conclude that the mind and body interact and are separate substances as
  Descartes suggests?
• Descartes’s reluctance or inability to explore the composition of his two substances
• The motivation or stimulus of thought might be actual physical sensations or the memory of
  such. Might this contradict what Descartes is claiming?
• Is there a hierarchy of thinking or thought with imagination, for Descartes, being at a low level
  and understanding at the highest? If so, what is the relationship of ‘doubting, affirming, denying,
  …willing’ …as well as evaluating and judging.

David Hume: Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion

5.   (a)   Explain Hume’s account of a child’s educational programme as a preparation for
           his investigation of religion.                                                             [10]

     (b)   Evaluate Hume’s account of a child’s educational programme as a preparation
           for his investigation of religion.                                                         [15]

     This question invites an explanation of the beginning of the Dialogue when the question is asked
     as to how and why children should study religion. The discussion that follows addresses the issues
     that relate to the shortcomings of other bodies of knowledge, as well as showing that their
     shortcomings are a way of suggesting the superiority of religion. The argument is put that it seems
     to be prudent to expose children to literature and sciences first before any encounter with
     Philosophy. Parallels might be drawn here with the approach to the education programme outlined
     in the Republic by Plato (physical fitness through to understanding mathematics and harmonics to
     dialectics) but for Hume "… students of philosophy ought first to learn logics, then ethics, next
     physics, last of all the nature of the gods." Demea, the traditional orthodox Christian in the
     dialogue, claims that the child’s mind needs to be ‘seasoned’ by the study of sciences. By studying
     the sciences, they are exposed to the associated problems and uncertainties of acquiring
     knowledge through the senses and experiences, compared to pure reason. After this a child is
     ready to investigate the ‘greatest mysteries of religion’. It might well be considered that all people
     need a broad education to grasp the complexity of the arguments and positions put forward by the
     three characters in the Dialogue. The philosophical reasoning of Cleanthes, the design theories
     outlined in the book, the references to astronomical activity, and the orthodox positions of Demea,
     require a breadth of knowledge to appreciate their implications. The Dialogue, with its approaches
     of pure reason, empiricism and blind faith in exploring the nature of God, is in stark contrast to a
     ‘profane and irreligious age’ claimed for the time of writing. The education programme that
     questions the certainties of the sciences allows religion to be protected and acquire ‘a superior
     force and authority’. In doing so, Hume feels safe to question the existences and essence of God
     though the dialogic method.

     Candidates might explore (part A):
     • The nature of uncertainties in different forms of knowledge
     • The nature of empiricism and rationalism
     • The differing stances of the dialoguers Cleanthes the empiricist, Philo the skeptic and Demea
       and his traditional fideism
     • Foundationalism and indubitable truths
     • A priori knowledge
     • Fideism
     • Whether conventional ways of investigating the world can be a source of knowing about God
     • Contrasts between Plato’s education programme, for a ruler, with the programme outlined in
       Hume’s Dialogue
     • Contrasts with Rousseau’s experiential education programme for Emile
     • The value of a broad education
     • The nature of Skepticism
     • The nature of and value gained from religious education.

     Possible discussion points include (part B):
     • The merits of differing approaches to investigating religion
     • Whether reasoning about God is preferable to doctrinal acceptance of religion and dogma
     • Contemporary views on how religious issues could be questioned without incurring criticism and
       censorship or even persecution
     • The dialogic method as a means of philosophical investigation contrasted with perhaps those of
       Plato and Cicero
     • Whether Hume was mirroring earlier dialogues and had learnt how to hide controversial views
       eg: Giulio Cesare Vanini and Pierre Bayle

• The nature of Hume’s own belief
• Is the child’s education programme a sort of metaphor for everyone in preparation of religious

  investigated the natural world or/and you know God better by fully understanding the nature of
  the natural world
• The position of the role and status of religious education in the general education of a children
  through time. Contrasts might be drawn from the secular positions of public education in the
  USA compared to required religious instruction under the UK 1944 Education Act and the status
  of doctrinal studies within Islamic countries
• The relationship of religious content in education programmes to the rights of children,
  eg: Article 14 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

6.   (a)   Explain the claim that “religion, however corrupted, is still better than no religion
           at all”.                                                                              [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the claim that “religion, however corrupted, is still better than
           no religion at all”.                                                                      [15]

     The question seeks an exploration of the role of religion in society as argued by Cleanthes, along
     with its perceived value and consequences. The discussion of the role of religion and the effect of
     a God on societal behaviour appears at the end of the Dialogue, in part 12, after Demea has left.
     Cleanthes claims that religion has a vital function, that being “to regulate the heart of men,
     humanize their conduct, infuse the spirit of temperance, order, and obedience… and only enforces
     the motives of morality and justice”. Philo the skeptic counters this position and suggests all the
     negative aspects of religion on humans - amongst other things, being: slavery, civil wars,
     oppression, persecutions. There is admittance of the differences between true belief and organized
     religion which might be more corrupt than the better form of religion which is seen as a
     ‘philosophical and rational kind’. By declaring this there is a move on Philo’s part to replace his
     skepticism with fideism. This could be seen as Hume attempting to moderate his critique of religion
     in general. It should be noted that Hume delayed the publication of the Dialogue because of fear of
     censorship and persecution by the authorities. There is a more positive spin on religion as it has
     the effect of being both a ‘hope as well as a fear’. However. Philo is still allowed to claim that
     natural ‘honesty and benevolence’ has more effect on human behaviour than ‘theological theories
     and systems.’ It seems clear that throughout Hume’s defense there is acceptance of a need for
     morals even though practiced religion across the world has many short comings. The criticism of
     religion becomes continually muted as Cleanthes closes, with the remark of “take care: […] push
     not matters too far: allow not your zeal against false religion to undermine your veneration for the
     true.” The dialogues are a way of exploring the nature of God and Hume tries to avoid being
     labelled anti-Christian.

John Stuart Mill: On Liberty

7.   (a)   Explain the idea that there is a struggle between liberty and authority.                     [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the idea that there is a struggle between liberty and authority.                    [15]

     In his introduction to On Liberty, Mill claims that “the struggle between Liberty and Authority is the
     most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly
     in that of Greece, Rome, and England”. Mill says that the tension between liberty and authority
     used to be a tension between the ruling classes and the ruled. However, at the time of writing this
     needed to be revised because the ruling classes were being replaced by representatives of the will
     of the people: “What was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified with the people; that
     their interest and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be
     protected against its own will. There was no fear of its tyrannizing over itself”. As Mill goes on to
     point out, the will of the people in practice is the will of the majority, and that the majority can
     oppress minority groups, and so people still require protection from authority. Throughout the book,
     Mill aims to establish the principle “that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully
     exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others”.
     This is Mill’s answer to the relationship between authority and liberty; liberty comes to the fore and
     authority ought to be restricted so that liberty is maintained. In a system where people govern
     themselves, they must be protected from the tyranny of the majority.

     Candidates might explore (part A):
     • The historical tension between authority and liberty, particularly the idea that individuals need to
       be protected from their sovereign
     • The naïve conception of representative democracy where the people do not need to be
       protected from their own will
     • The duty of care that the state has towards members of society, eg: restricting liberty for the
       general good not necessarily the individual good
     • What Mill means by the tyranny of the majority
     • Examples of liberties which might be restricted by the majority eg: religious freedom, sexual
       freedom, freedom of speech
     • Ways in which liberty can be protected eg: rights, laws, constitutions, representative democratic
       measures
     • The relationship between political power and those whose liberties are infringed upon eg: the
       historical oppression of women particularly before they were able to vote
     • Mill’s harm principle in relation to protecting liberty.

     Possible discussion points include (part B):
     • Alternative perspectives on liberty and authority eg: Hobbes’s view that a sovereign’s full
       authority is justified to prevent a war of all against all
     • The extent to which the liberties of minority groups can or should be sacrificed for the will of the
       majority
     • Minority groups in society who have been subject to oppression by the majority eg: the LGBTQ
       community, different religious groups in different countries, ethnic minority groups
     • Mill’s ideas about higher and lower pleasures in relation to liberty and authority ie: to Mill, lower
       pleasures of the majority cannot justify the loss of important freedoms to a minority. This might
       be compared to Bentham’s principle of utility which might justify such an approach
     • Difficulties with the harm principle ie: what constitutes harm?
     • Whether preventing harm is sufficient for maximizing liberty and protecting from authority
     • Alternative ethical perspectives such as care ethics (Kittay) which suggest that vulnerable
       members of society need more than just to have their liberty protected
     • Modern examples of the struggle between authority and freedom eg: gun ownership in the US
     • Paternalism, and the idea that authority has a right to make judgements about what is good for
       others, even if it goes against their will eg: vaccine mandates
     • Whether libertarian political systems protect their subjects from harm.

8.   (a)   Explain Mill’s account of “injury to others”.                                                 [10]

     (b)   Evaluate Mill’s account of “injury to others”.                                                [15]

     Throughout On Liberty, Mill mentions the idea of injury, and particularly “injury to others”. This idea
     of injury is central to the text because Mill argues for the principle that liberty should only be
     curtailed to prevent harm to others. This requires some account of what harm, or injury is. For
     example, when discussing freedom of expression, Mill says “there should be different opinions, so
     is it that there should be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to varieties
     of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved
     practically, when anyone thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not
     primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself”. Mill points out that a person may cause
     injury to others through action, as well as inaction; that individuals can injure themselves; that
     injury can effect one person, or many people, and that injuring others is always a greater evil than
     restricting one’s own liberty. On the other hand, Mill is concerned that restricting liberty for any
     reason other than to prevent injury to others is a form of despotism which ‘crushes individuality’.
     In the balance between individual liberty, and limitations to liberty, the idea of harm or injury plays
     a central role. How injury is defined shapes the real-world implications of Mill’s thesis.

     Candidates might explore (part A):
     • Mill’s discussion of the sale of poisons where the sale alone does not cause injury, but the likely
       outcome of someone buying poison is injury to others
     • The example of the person who is restrained from crossing an unsafe bridge
     • The worked-through examples on alcohol use and idleness. For example, in the case of
       idleness, Mill claims that it would be wrong to restrict the individual for simply being idle, but if a
       man "fails to perform his legal duties to others, as for instance to support his children, it is no
       tyranny to force him to fulfil that obligation, by compulsory labour, if no other means are
       available”
     • The idea that failing to act can injure others
     • Whether free speech can ever injure others
     • Actions that constitute injury to others eg: violence, neglect
     • The role of authority in preventing injury
     • The view that society itself can be injured eg: if free speech is suppressed and society no longer
       progresses through sharing new ideas.

     Possible discussion points include (part B):
     • Whether Mill presents a clear enough account of injury to others to make his harm principle
       practical in real-world situations
     • Paternalism and intervention to prevent children from injuring themselves from action or inaction
     • The extent to which rational individuals should be allowed to experiment with different ways of
       living, and how to define when they begin to harm either themselves or others
     • Whether Mill’s claim that the idle person is injuring his children by failing to support them is
       correct
     • Injury and physical harm
     • Accounts of harm in society that are less libertarian eg: the view that structural injustice harms
       individuals. This implies a more strictly regulated society than Mill promotes where the state
       intervenes to actively support people, rather than just to prevent injury
     • Discussions of contemporary issues, eg: hate crimes, discrimination, vaccine mandates
     • Neo-contractarianism, eg: Nozick’s free riders
     • Human rights and injury to others.

Friedrich Nietzsche: The Genealogy of Morals

9.   (a)   Explain the significance of the noble values of Nietzsche’s man of the future.            [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the significance of the noble values of Nietzsche’s man of the future.           [15]

     The question invites an explanation of Nietzsche’s use of the ‘man of the future’ to belittle and try
     and remove the values of the slave or herd and reveal that the man of the future will be/should be
     the man of noble values. Nietzsche’s discussion of this appears at the end of Essay 2 in section 24
     and it also appears in his preface to section 6. For Nietzsche the man of the future will be free of
     slave morality and break with the ideals that are made in the workshop observed by Mr Rash and
     Mr Curious (Essay 1, section 14). The man of the future will end the will to nothingness and the
     nausea, and bring about an end to nihilism that is created by bad conscience and guilt generated
     by an ascetic priest. The man of the future will be a reborn human who practices a will to power
     and is the victor over God. Nietzsche hopes for the arrival of this man because he sees this as the
     only way out of the dominance of morality and a lifestyle that values humility and self-sacrifice; a
     lifestyle that is dominated by religion. The new man is a ‘good man’ having the qualities of the
     masters that were defeated by the slaves. He is the overman or super-man. He will be a man that
     can be driven by the once suppressed animal instincts. Nietzsche concludes that the present day
     which is ‘self-doubting’ will decay and this will allow the rebirth of the new man. If slave morality
     were to continue it would be the ‘danger of all dangers.’ Those of slave morality, of course, would
     not welcome this future as it would not allow the kingdom of God, the reign of justice, or free will
     and it would not be guided by love and hope. Candidates might describe the positives offered by
     Nietzsche in the ‘future man’ as he would not abuse nature, as science would not be seen as
     supreme. Science would not remain the new religion. The fear of nihilism will not come about as
     life itself would be a will to power.

     Candidates might explore (part A):
     • The slave and master (the noble) divisions and differences
     • Bad Conscience
     • The ‘will to power’
     • The origins of morality according to Nietzsche
     • The workshop of values and ideals as encountered by Mr Rash and Mr Curious
     • The impact of religion and science on present lifestyles
     • The ascetic priest
     • The nature of the new reality that could be the future.

     Possible discussion points include (part B):
     • Nietzsche’s relationship to Nihilism
     • Postmodernist positions of lukewarm radicalism compared to the potentially new relativism and
       subjectivity of the future
     • The degree to which a ‘will to power’ is life in action
     • The interaction between the slave and the master in the future
     • The return and lack of suppression of animal instincts
     • Whether the qualities of the ‘superman’ should be valued as better than the slave
     • Whether the human of the future is potentially a mad man or an artist-warrior
     • The degree to which the Nietzschean future is the complete antitheses of the present western
       world and far more radical than postmodernists
     • Whether the fear of a Nietzschean future is a fear of our human nature uncontrolled
     • The status of the sage, ‘will to power’ and non-action
     • Comparisons with interpretations of the Nietzschean future and other utopias or dystopias
       eg: 2001 (A. C. Clarke).

10.   (a)   Explain the nature of the reactive man.                                                    [10]

      (b)   Evaluate the nature of the reactive man.                                                   [15]

      The question seeks an explanation of the description that Nietzsche gives to humans that are
      wedded in ressentiment, that is the reactive man. He uses this phrase in Essay 2, section 11 to
      contrast the aggressive man that he values greatly. The reactive man is a man of slave morality,
      and has all the associated qualities such as compassion, tolerance, humility and the inherent
      feelings of ressentiment. The reactive man is the exact opposite of the ‘noble man’ who Nietzsche
      says is closer to true justice, because he is aggressive, strong, active, and arrogant. The reactive
      man will not seek revenge for himself but appeals to established law to resolve a wrongdoing. This
      man is weak in society because he relies both on the law, and, for Nietzsche, the morality of
      Christianity to protect him from his fellow humans. Bad conscience, the guilt that he feels as the
      reactive man, is not seen by himself as a weakness, but for Nietzsche he is weak and becomes
      sick. It would seem that the reactive man almost enjoys suffering from sickness. By the process of
      always reverting to the law the reactive man has removed the ‘will to power’ that for Nietzsche is
      an essential for life. The law and the moral codes of the herd become sovereign. Justice is no
      longer in the hands of victim, but it has become systemized, objectified, and distant. In contrast
      Nietzsche would prefer the aggressive man who is able to discharge justice at his will, thence he,
      not the law, is sovereign. The reactive man has given up this ‘will to power’ and ‘wills nothingness’
      and suffers.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The nature of ressentiment
      • Bad conscience
      • The morality of Christianity the idea of not seeking revenge
      • Views of justice and effect of justice on society
      • The link between indebtedness and guilt and its linguistic origins
      • The contrasted nature of the masters (nobles)
      • The ‘will to power’
      • Suffering and neurosis in societies and the possible linkage to slave morality.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • The extent to which conflict in society generates social progress
      • The role of self-preservation and justice in society
      • The potential weaknesses of slave morality. Does it have strengths that Nietzsche does not
        appreciate?
      • The relationship of power to justice or whether power is just a desire to dominate others
      • Reference to virtue ethics as an illustration of ressentiment
      • The degree to which all interaction with others is a power and dominance game
      • Can the reactive man’s qualities of compassion and sympathy be seen as a strength or a
        weakness?
      • Ways in which moral agency is demonstrated
      • Is the reactive man, the member of the herd, less strong?
      • Is social disorder in modern complex societies a result of men of action or a lack of social
        justice?

Martha Nussbaum: Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach

11.   (a)   Explain Nussbaum’s view on the concept of dignity.                                                [10]

      (b)   Evaluate Nussbaum’s view on the concept of dignity.                                               [15]

      The question asks for an exploration of a central concept in Nussbaum’s theory. The concept of
      dignity is disseminated across Nussbaum’s whole book and is related to several other views.
      Candidates might explain that Nussbaum considers the respect for dignity, along with the respect
      for equality, a widely shared human value. Also, candidates might illustrate how Nussbaum
      presents Vasanti’s story as a sample of mistaken standpoints on the concepts of equality and
      dignity. It might be noteworthy to consider that the lack of respect for dignity is often linked to
      violence: when bodily integrity and health are constantly at risk, dignity is violated. Candidates
      might explain how the concept of dignity is related to the reason why Nussbaum considers her list
      of Central Capabilities open and not final. If it is found to omit something fundamental that
      experience shows to be essential to a dignified human life, it can be revised. Another point of
      discussion might be grounded in Nussbaum’s view that dignity does not concern poor nations
      only, but it is a global issue calling for all nations to struggle for it, along with equality and justice.
      Candidates might explain why Nussbaum judges all nations to be failing to ensure dignity and
      opportunity for all people. Candidates might compare Nussbaum’s view to other philosophical
      interpretations of the concept of dignity, eg: Kant or Schopenhauer.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • Nussbaum’s view on dignity
      • Nussbaum’s view on equality
      • Nussbaum’s view on justice
      • Vasanti’s story
      • The concept of dignity as related to the list of Capabilities
      • Dignity and wealthy nations
      • Nussbaum’s view of dignity in nonhuman animals
      • Human dignity and political liberalism.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Nussbaum’s criticism of Sen’s view of dignity
      • Human dignity and paternalism
      • Human dignity in other philosophical views, eg: Kant, Schopenhauer
      • Human dignity, social justice, and equality, eg: Rawls
      • Dignity and liberty, eg: negative versus positive liberty
      • Possible counter positions, eg: Nozick’s “free riders”
      • Extension of the concept of dignity to nonhuman animals, eg: Singer, Regan.
                                                   – 25 –                                    8823 – 5602M


12.   (a)   Explain Nussbaum’s claim that we can justify the state’s intervention in the
            home if the rights of its members are violated.                                           [10]

      (b)   Evaluate Nussbaum’s claim that we can justify the state’s intervention in the
            home if the rights of its members are violated.                                           [15]

      The question stems from the claim in Chapter 3, where Nussbaum presents the Human Rights
      Approach. The claim shows Nussbaum’s standpoint on the possibility for a state to enforce human
      rights even at the home: against liberal views. Nussbaum affirms that households and families can
      be the object of the state’s intervention for the sake of human rights, eg: against violence, or to
      guarantee dignity. This view is grounded in Nussbaum’s claim that there is a connection between
      the capabilities and how a state is governed: candidates might consider Nussbaum’s criticism of
      Sen, who does not see this connection. Candidates might refer to Nussbaum’s statement against
      the distinction between ‘first-generation rights’ (political and civil rights) and
      ‘second-generation rights’ (economic and social rights): political and civil rights have economic and
      social preconditions. Candidates might also explore the related concepts of dignity, equality,
      justice. Also, candidates might explain the kind of connection that there is between human rights
      and duties, or the difference between “negative rights” and capabilities, including the concept of
      negative liberty. Candidates might explain why Nussbaum focuses on human rights and whether
      there is a connection between them and the Capabilities Approach. Candidates might also explore
      whether the two approaches substantially overlap, or whether the Capabilities Approach is
      broader, eg: including nonhuman animals. Hence, candidates might relate Nussbaum’s view to
      other philosophical views, eg: Singer’s or Regan’s theories on animal rights. Candidates might
      explore what basic entitlements are considered as rights, eg: bare human birth instead of
      rationality, and compare them with other philosophical views, eg: Kant, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The Human Rights Approach
      • Central Capabilities and the relationship with governments
      • Nussbaum’s criticism on Sen
      • ‘First-generation’ and ‘second-generation’ rights
      • Dignity, equality, justice
      • Negative rights and capabilities
      • Human rights and animal rights
      • Basic entitlements.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Nussbaum’s approach and paternalism
      • Social control, authoritarianism
      • Issues related to other lifestyles and cultures; multiculturalism, relativism, minorities
      • Other views on nonhuman animals, eg: Singer, Regan
      • Other views on basic entitlements, eg: rationality or self-conscience
      • The relationship between political/civil rights and economic/social rights, eg: Marx, Feuerbach,
        de Beauvoir, Adorno
      • Other views on the state intervention in the individual sphere, eg: Nozick’s “Free riders”,
        Taylor’s authenticity.

José Ortega y Gasset: The Origins of Philosophy

13.   (a)   Explain the new human figure of the thinker in the origin of the profession of
            philosophy.                                                                              [10]

      (b)   Evaluate the new human figure of the thinker in the origin of the profession of
            philosophy.                                                                              [15]

      The aim of this question is to explain (part A) and evaluate (part B) the culmination of Ortega y
      Gasset’s argument in the final chapter (The Historical Origin of the Profession of Philosophy),
      where he analyses the forming of a new type of man, the "thinker," as the origin of the transmitted
      forms of the philosopher and philosophy. Answers might be focused on this chapter but also take
      different routes based on other parts of the text. Ortega y Gasset argues that the ambiguity of the
      term "thinker" was suitable, because the reality to which it refers is similarly vague and
      ambiguous. The thinker as such has different chronological and geographical roots, eg:
      “Heraclitus' and Parmenides' generation found this new human figure, typified both in character
      and profession, already formed, though hazy”. The first practitioners of this new social occupation,
      whose activities were mainly theoretical, were not yet able to perceive themselves as thinkers, just
      as Julius Caesar was not able to see himself as Caesar. A more distinct configuration of the thinker
      was apparent in Plato's Academy. Evaluations of Ortega y Gasset’s idea that might be seen as
      counterarguments sustain that although Ortega y Gasset´s view on the origin of philosophy
      contains valuable intuitions and suggestions to be further explored, the textual basis, criticism of
      sources, and bibliographic research needs a substantial update.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The various chronological and geographical roots which contribute to the configuration of the
        thinker
      • During the sixth century, among certain enclaves in colonial Greece, religion ceased to be a
        possible way of life and consequently a new position toward this changed nature of existence
        had to be devised in opposition to religious existence
      • The change in relation to the religious existence and the underlying meaning of Thales’s
        assertion that all things are full of gods
      • Ortega y Gasset’s claim that Thales’s statement belongs to the epigrammatic style of the Seven
        Wise Men
      • The transformation from religion into philosophy in Thales’s statement: a) there is a kind of
        democratization and universalization of the divine and b) the gods were downgraded into
        causes
      • Protagoras and atheism; the apparent claim that it is impossible to know whether or not gods
        exist, or “granting that they do exist what their forms are”
      • The forming of the concept of the thinker implied a change towards religion: “The God who
        appears at the conclusion of an argument is obviously not a religious God, but a theoretical
        principle”
      • The thinker felt compelled to seek through intellectual free choice a new foundation: “This free
        choice of principles has been called ‘rationality’”
      • When the name philosophy is given to this free choice of principles, the creation of philosophy
        presupposes a stage of atheism.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • The great semantic mobility of the word "God"
      • The role and conceptions of the Ionian natural scientists
      • Philosophical thinkers-Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Xenophanes
      • Ortega y Gasset’s linguistic and philological approach to the origin of philosophy
      • Comparison and contrast with other cultural traditions, eg: the parallelism between Amos, the
        first Hebrew "thinker," and Thales
      • The idea that the socialization of the "thinker" came about during the fifth century

• Does Ortega y Gasset offer a unified vision of the thinker and its effect in the origin of
  philosophy?

14.   (a)   Explain the function of history in Ortega y Gasset’s account of the origin of
            philosophy.                                                                                 [10]

      (b)   Evaluate the function of history in Ortega y Gasset’s account of the origin of
            philosophy.                                                                                 [15]

      This question asks for an explanation and evaluation of the very backbone of Ortega y Gasset’s
      account of the origin of philosophy, which is based on his idea of historical reason. Answers might
      make reference to the few explicit references in the text or take the various routes offered by
      almost all the chapters where Ortega y Gasset presents, from different angles, the function of
      history as to the origin of philosophy. Regarding this category of historical reason Ortega y Gasset
      states that it is “being in the form of having been”. The idea has its origin in W. Dilthey who had
      sustained that physical reason would be supplanted by historical reason. Ortega sees this as an
      indication that the 20th century is the beginning of a new time in which the idea of life will come to
      maturity. And, explaining one significative application of historical reason to the conception of
      philosophy, he adds that without wanting to formalize a definitive stance on the issue, he
      proposes the idea that we are now engaging into something novel and distinct from previous
      philosophy. As counterargument one might analyse the extent to which Ortega y Gasset does
      provide a consistent and unified argument sustaining the idea of historical reason.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • Historicity as a constitutive element in the human being
      • Roots of historical reason: Hegel, Comte and Dilthey
      • Historical reason attempts to capture the unity of these central traits of human life: a) “nothing
        truly human if it is at all real and concrete, can be permanent”; and b) “man has an invariable
        structure which traverses all of his changes”
      • Religion, philosophy, and literature, vital functions of the human mind, appear as permanent
        possibilities in man
      • Philosophy as something that was not always in operation in the history of human beings, but
        that emerged in Ancient Greece, has come down to us, but its continuation is not assured
      • The history of philosophy as dialectical series
      • Structure and meaning of the philosophical past
      • Unity and diversity of the philosophy
      • The names of philosophy and Ortega y Gasset’s historical approach to language.


      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • What would “reason” mean when it has to be “historical?”
      • The extent to which the past is always in the present
      • The reality of chance as challenge to historical reason
      • Causes, motives and narrations in understanding and explaining the past and the historical
        development of philosophy
      • Ortega y Gasset’s idea that chance is a central component of reality and history
      • Historical reason versus physical reason. Ortega y Gasset’s views on Descartes and modern
        philosophy
      • Historical reason as a consistent attempt to balance the present with the past, discontinuity with
        continuity, plurality with unity, and concrete reality with abstract generality
      • Historical reason allows to understand human life as the basis of reality making possible a new
        philosophy
      • When seeking pre-Socratic roots in the origin of philosophy by combining historical, social and
        linguistic inquiry Ortega y Gasset proposes a methodology which presents similarities and
        differences with Nietzsche’s and Heidegger’s
      • Ortega y Gasset’s view of philosophy in comparison and contrast with present approaches to
        philosophy, eg: pragmatism, Foucauldian critique of power, feminism.

Plato: The Republic, Books IV–IX

15.   (a)   Explain Socrates’s view that the form of the good is the most important thing to
            learn about.                                                                                 [10]

      (b)   Evaluate Socrates’s view that the form of the good is the most important thing to
            learn about.                                                                      [15]

      In the first place the question asks for an explanation of this central idea of Plato’s philosophical
      inquiry and subsequently in part B it requires an evaluation of Plato’s argument. In this very heart
      of the Republic (502c–521b) Plato looks to show that what philosophers naturally do is directed
      toward politically valuable insight. It attempts to explain how a philosophical education prepares a
      guardian for political power. Accordingly, Socrates investigates the ultimate purpose of
      philosophical activity and reflects on the education of the philosopher, with Socrates stating that
      “the form of the good is the most important thing to learn about”. In order to explain this idea, he
      uses a series of images: the Form of the Good is like the sun; the relations among the Form of the
      Good, all other Forms, and the objects of the visible world may be outlined along a divided line;
      and, human beings’ relationship to the Form of the Good resembles the relationship of prisoners in
      a cave to the sun. As the highest principle for both ethics and metaphysics, at once the best thing
      in the world and the most real, the Form of the Good would justify the rule of philosophers. Given
      its scope the notion of the Form of the Good gives rise to a variety of arguments and
      counterarguments in relation to issues of interpretation: eg: the relation between the forms and the
      individuals. Further, a counterargument to the philosophical conception based on the Form of the
      Good states that the cost of this all-inclusive theory of reality and the good life is that it degrades
      the value of ethical behaviour practiced without philosophy.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The form of the good is the first principle of the entire theory, the greatest object of knowledge
        (505a) which seems to be an ideal of rational order or unity
      • The Form of the Good interweaves questions of reality with questions of knowledge,
        metaphysics and epistemology
      • The Form of the Good is intended to unite the pursuits of philosophers with the ethical
        knowledge that makes life worth living and by virtue of which philosophers are qualified to rule
        in the ideal city
      • The image of the sun
      • The Form of the Good is a condition of the intelligibility of other things
      • The Divided Line
      • The Allegory of the Cave
      • The Form of the Good as Form of Forms; it makes knowledge of other Forms possible through
        the same ideality of Forms
      • The role of the Form of the Good as guidance for education. The guardians’ curriculum which
        includes: music and gymnastics, arithmetic, geometry, and dialectic.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • The Form of the Good as a standard or paradigm, that enables the philosopher to determine
        what poetical, political, or any other kind of goodness is
      • The role The Form of the Good as political guidance implies to lay out the plan for a good state
        in order to specify which features of existing states engender the injustices in which human

16.   (a)   Explain Plato’s account of the possibility of conflict between the parts of the
            soul.                                                                                        [10]

      (b)   Evaluate Plato’s account of the possibility of conflict between the parts of the
            soul.                                                                                        [15]

      The question asks for an explanation and evaluation of Plato’s view on the role of conflict in the
      soul. Both parts of the question are anchored in Book 4 where a picture of the human soul starts
      to be presented. Three elements in the soul are distinguished: desire or appetite (epithumia), the
      rational part, reason or calculation (logistikon) and the spirited part or spirit (thumos), in some
      contexts referred to as emotions. The argument where the conflict appears as a central dimension
      of human existence runs at both levels, individual and social. The central traits might be presented
      as follows: 1) conflict in the soul implies different parts that are opposed to each other; 2) desire is
      opposed by the rational part of the soul; and 3) spirit is different from both desire and the
      calculating part. Two results are drawn from here: first, the parts of the soul are identical in number
      and function with the parts of the city, and second, virtue in the individual person will be structured
      the same way as virtue in the city. According to one line of interpretation justice in the city serves
      only as an analogy to illuminate justice in the individual soul, whereas counterarguments to this
      line of interpretation sustain that the main concern of the platonic argument is the city itself.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • Socrates wants to show that the embodied human soul consists of three things, each one of
        which has, as it were, a mental life of its own, by which it has its own characteristic concerns
        and sensitivities and its own objects of pursuit
      • In the context of Book 4 the three elements in the soul are distinguished principally by their
        functions: calculation calculates, desire desires, and spirit gets spirited
      • If one tries to assign them an object or goal as well as an activity, the indications would be that
        calculation is concerned with the good (ie: with the best course of action); desire is concerned
        with pleasure; while spirit reacts to perceived slights or wrongs
      • When we are motivated to exert ourselves in some way or other (eg: in the process of learning,
        or when we are angry and seek retribution, or when we are hungry and want to have a meal) do
        these motivating conditions belong to a number of distinct parts of ourselves, or does every one
        of them belong to the soul as a whole
      • The larger context of the analysis of the soul in Book 4: the task to produce an adequate
        account of justice
      • While it is Socrates’s primary task to say what it is for a person to be just, he proposes to begin
        by trying to discover what it is for a city to be just, expecting that the larger scale will facilitate
        the task of discovery
      • Things properly called “just” must be just by way of the same essential features; thus, just cities
        and just souls will be similar in structure and arrangement
      • The virtues (aretai) of the city: wisdom, courage, self-control and justice, and their application to
        the individual soul
      • The best city contains three classes of citizens: rulers, the military, and businesspeople of
        various sorts. Justice in the city consists in each class adequately performing, and strictly
        limiting itself to, its own proper function.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Is there only one desiring subject in every one of us or are there more than one?
      • An interpretation of Socrates’s analysis: that what corresponds to each one of the three classes
        of citizens in the best city is simply some tendency or capacity of the soul
      • To what extent are the three parts of the soul related to distinct human actions?
      • The extent to which Plato, like Freud, sees inner conflict as both the most important fact about
        human existence and the phenomenon that most reveals the structure of the personality
      • The extent to which learning, and experience bring the psychic elements together into individual
        and distinctly personal human mental events; the functions of different parts, whether bodily or
        psychic, come together in the individual’s activities

• The indivisibility of the soul
• The action of the individual is for the sake of the individual’s own good or happiness as the
  guardian’s actions are for the sake of the good or happiness of the entire city
• How and to what extent might the parallel between justice in the individual soul and justice in
  the city be justified? Might it be justified that there is a parallel?
• Plato’s theory of the soul in the Republic in relation to others approaches: eg: Phaedo’s theory
  of soul, presocratic thinking about the soul
• Plato’s projections on the conceptions of the soul and justice from Aristotle up to modern day.

Peter Singer: The Life You Can Save

17.   (a)     Explain Singer’s claim that individuals’ moral intuitions are not always reliable.      [10]

      (b)     Evaluate Singer’s claim that individuals’ moral intuitions are not always reliable.     [15]

      The claim is from Chapter 2, where Singer illustrates the “Basic Argument”. The claim is a criticism
      of a commonly shared belief that we should aid other people when they are in distress and we are
      there, they are visible to us, and we are the only ones who can help them. Candidates might explain
      Singer’s argument by referring to the three premises and the conclusion he presents as his logical
      argument. Candidates might also mention the stories of the drowning child and the one of Bob
      and the Bugatti. Candidates might analyse Singer’s argument that ethics is all about putting
      ourselves in the place of others; hence, candidates might explore other views on ethical altruism
      or empathy, eg: Scheler, Stein, Rée. The argument might call for an exploration of the Golden
      Rule, that Singer defines “remarkably universal”, by finding it in many religions and philosophies.
      Candidates might explain why affluence is a central term in Singer’s view and how it is related to
      giving to the poor. Candidates might mention the religious views on helping the poor, eg:
      Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Candidates might discuss the argument that Singer presents as
      a common objection to giving and consider whether philanthropic responses undermine real
      political change. Moreover, candidates might explore the “identifiable victim effect”, parochialism,
      or futility (ie, focusing on the number of people we cannot help, rather than the number we can),
      which tend to limit people’s will to give. Candidates might consider other philosophical views, with
      reference to utilitarianism, eg: Bentham, Mill, Sidgwick, situation ethics, eg: Fletcher, or, as a
      possible criticism of Singer, intuitionism, eg: Moore.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      •     Singer’s Basic Argument
      •     Stories of the drowning child and Bob and the Bugatti
      •     The Golden Rule
      •     Altruism and helping the poor in religions
      •     The ‘identifiable victim effect’
      •     The concept of parochialism
      •     The concept of futility
      •     Sense of fairness.
      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Other views on altruism and empathy, eg: Stein, Scheler
      • Altruism as masked egoism, eg: Hobbes, Helvetius, Rée, Nietzsche
      • Philanthropy as undermining political change
      • Morality and intuitions, eg: Moore
      • Morality and calculation, eg: utilitarianism
      • Morality and emotions, eg: Rée, Damasio, Nussbaum, Churchland.

18.   (a)   Explain Singer’s view on the pros and cons of anonymous giving.                               [10]

      (b)   Evaluate Singer’s view on the pros and cons of anonymous giving.                              [15]

      The question stems from Singer’s argument presented in Chapter 5. Singer’s view on the
      necessity to create a culture of giving is grounded in the evaluation of the pros and cons of
      anonymous giving. Singer mentions Jesus’s message in favour of secret donations, which
      suggests “not to sound a trumpet when we give to the poor”. Candidates might explain that the risk
      of publicizing donations is related to hypocrisy: donors are motivated just by the desire of
      increasing their reputation and honour and not by a real interest in aiding the others, nor because
      of their generosity. Candidates might also mention Maimonides’s recommendation for anonymity
      either of the donor or of the recipient: they should not know each other to avoid either the
      recipient’s feeling of being indebted to the donor, or the possibility of a public humiliation for
      accepting charity. Candidates might explore whether Singer considers such arguments relevant or
      not. In a global world it is rare that donors and recipients of donations know each other. Moreover,
      Singer affirms that what we look for in creating a culture of giving is donor’s money, not their
      motives: candidates might explore whether such a culture also calls for motives and not just for
      money. In fact, Singer refers to a sense of fairness: if we are less likely to give to others when we
      see that other people are not doing it, it is also true that we are more likely to give when we see
      other people giving. Hence, if the aim is to encourage more people to donate or to donate more,
      and if this aim is more easily reachable by knowing that others are donating, we should not be
      interested in also knowing their motives. Candidates might also consider that anonymity
      undermines the ‘identifiable victim effect’: knowing the people in need helps donors in avoiding a
      feeling of futility. Candidates might highlight the cons of identifying a specific person as recipient of
      the donation, eg: a child, because helping an individual is less effective than a more community-
      based approach. Candidates might pinpoint the concept of self-interest and explain that there is
      both a broad and narrow sense of it: Singer mentions Hobbes’s argument after giving a coin to a
      beggar in supporting generosity as a way to express self-interest, eg: being happy in seeing
      beggar’s happiness. Candidates might explore other philosophical views on self-interest, egoism,
      and altruism, eg: Rousseau, Rée, Nietzsche.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • Singer’s reference to Jesus and Maimonides
      • Anonymity as a means to preserve both the donor and the recipient
      • The ‘identifiable victim effect’ and the feeling of futility
      • Individual aid versus community-based approaches
      • The role of motives in giving
      • Giving as a means to increase the donor’s reputation
      • The sense of fairness in motivating donors to give or to give more
      • Broad and narrow sense of self-interest.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Hypocrisy as related to giving
      • Egoism as masked altruism, eg: Hobbes, Helvetius, Rée, Nietzsche
      • Self-interest and generosity, eg: Hobbes’s argument on the beggar’s happiness
      • Generosity is not a virtue if it is imbalanced, eg: Aristotle
      • Different kinds of self-interest, eg: Rousseau’s two types of self-love, amour de soi and amour-
        propre
      • Whether a culture of giving might be created without considering the motives of giving: different
        ethical approaches, eg: virtue ethics versus utilitarianism.

Charles Taylor: The Ethics of Authenticity

19.   (a)   Explain Taylor’s view that language represents the modern tendency to
            subjectivation.                                                                               [10]

      (b)   Evaluate Taylor’s view that language represents the modern tendency to
            subjectivation.                                                                               [15]

      The question stems from the argument that Taylor presents in Chapter 8 on “Subtler Languages”
      and is a further analysis of what Taylor defines as a consequence of the slide to subjectivism:
      subjectivation is the tendency of things to “centre more and more on the subject”. The question
      invites an exploration of the concept of subjectivation and its consequences, as a result of
      instrumental reason and self-centered fulfilment. Candidates might relate it to self-referentiality and
      pinpoint the two different facets of it, the “manner” and the “content”, since “to confuse these two
      kinds of self-referentiality is catastrophic”, according to Taylor. While the manner of this subjectivist
      tendency can be self-referential, the content must refer to other than the subject. Candidates might
      discuss Taylor’s argument on art to show how modernity has led to the worst forms of
      subjectivism: it is about the shift from art as mimesis, that is in terms of imitation or reproduction,
      toward a more creative one (poiesis). Candidates might present Taylor’s view on poetry,
      Renaissance and Romanticism, which illustrates the change of language: while poets and artists
      used to refer to shared knowledge and senses in the past — what Taylor calls “correspondences”,
      modernity has loosened the references to a common background or system of beliefs. Hence,
      modern poetry cannot be the investigation of an 'objective' order in the traditional sense of a
      publicly accessible framework of references. Candidates might highlight the relation between
      subjectivism, anthropocentric language and ecological policies. Candidates might evaluate
      whether authenticity plays a role in interpreting correctly subjectivism towards a connection to a
      wider whole. Candidates might refer to other philosophical views, eg: Wittgenstein’s view on
      language, Adorno’s view on phantasy in terms of creative art, Aristotle’s definitions of mimesis and
      poiesis, Ortega y Gasset’s concept of the revolt of the masses.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • Subjectivation in relation with instrumental reason and individualism (self-centered fulfilment)
      • The slide to subjectivism; the culture of narcissism
      • Two different facets of self-referentiality: manner and content
      • Shift from mimesis to poiesis in art
      • Change of poetic language: from “correspondences” to personal sensitivity
      • Anthropocentric language and ecological policies
      • Knockers versus boosters
      • Authenticity and transcendence of the subject
      • Cosmic order and the “great chain of Being”.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Other views on subjectivity, eg: Descartes, Kant, Kierkegaard
      • Subjectivism as a result of socio-political changes, eg: Ortega y Gasset’s revolt of the masses
      • Aristotle’s view on art and the distinction between mimesis and poiesis
      • Whether technology affected art in terms of creativity or reproduction, eg: Benjamin, Adorno
      • The role of phantasy to break homologation in art and language, eg: Goethe, Adorno
      • The limits of language, eg: Wittgenstein
      • Whether instrumental reason fosters subjectivism or homologation of values, eg: career,
        success, affluence.

20.   (a)     Explain the relationship between instrumental reason and the development of a
              technological society.                                                                  [10]

      (b)     Evaluate the relationship between instrumental reason and the development of a
              technological society.                                                                  [15]

      The claim is from Chapter 9, “An Iron Cage?”, where Taylor sets out his view on instrumental
      reason. Candidates might explain Taylor’s view on technological development and his invitation to
      a balanced approach. Candidates might consider knockers and boosters and their polarized views
      in terms of optimism versus pessimism. Candidates might evaluate these positions in relation with
      environmental issues: on one hand, technology is seen as the solution to fix all, on the other hand,
      advocates of sustainability invoke a return to a genuine relationship with nature. Candidates might
      focus on Taylor’s attempt to link authenticity to a better approach to technology, which may allow
      us to get back some balance, where technology could occupy a place in our lives other than a
      constant, unreflected mandatory one. Candidates might present and support their own views on
      the role that technology might play in modern societies and in relation to contemporary issues.
      Candidates might highlight that technology fosters instrumental reason not only because of a
      certain moral outlook, but because the market forces strongly influence a society, if economic
      agents wish to survive, they must give a lot of significance to efficiency. Modern society is
      technological and spreads the need for efficiency in all fields, from markets to scientism: atomism,
      instrumental reason, bureaucracy are a few tools of its advancement. Candidates might explore
      the concept of the “iron cage” and might refer to other views on technology, eg: Bacon,
      Heidegger, Ortega y Gasset, Dewey.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The “iron cage”; Weber’s view on the “iron cage”
      • Polarized views on technology: boosters versus knockers
      • Authenticity in relation with technology
      • Technology in relation with atomism, instrumental reason, bureaucracy
      • Technology in relation with economic needs and markets (efficiency)
      • Self-determining freedom
      • Technology as domination, eg: in relation with nature
      • Fragmentation and political participation of local communities.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):

      •     Environmental issues in relation with technology
      •     Technology and feminism, eg: domination as a male approach
      •     Boosters and knockers as representing political left and right
      •     The role of liberalism and conservatism in setting the technological agenda
      •     Technology and alienation, eg: Adorno, Horkheimer, Marcuse, Debord
      •     Other views on technology and the human being as a technological being (including positive
            views), eg: Heidegger, Ortega y Gasset, Plessner, Gehlen, Dewey.

Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching

21.   (a)   Explain the view that when people see some things as beautiful, other things
            become ugly.                                                                             [10]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that when people see some things as beautiful, other things
            become ugly.                                                                             [15]

      The claim is from Chapter 2. Candidates might explore the connection of this claim to another one:
      “When people see some things as good, other things become bad.” The whole chapter invites an
      analysis of the fact that proper knowledge of things cannot be reached but by the Sage. Also, the
      claims refer to a necessary relationship between opposites. Candidates might consider an
      exploration of the Tao as a balance of contrasting powers or other philosophical views,
      eg: Cusanus’s coincidentia oppositorum and more recent dialectics, eg: Hegel, Jung, Eliade.
      Beyond the ontological theories, candidates might pinpoint the epistemic consequences of the
      claim, which implies the impossibility to know a thing without its opposite. Candidates might
      discuss the figure of the Sage and the ability to practice non-action in doing things, staying
      independent from them. Also, the Sage accomplishes things but claims no credit or merit for this:
      candidates might consider the role of words and claims as conventional elements whose function
      is requested by whom do not accomplish things, nor have any merit. Candidates might refer to the
      real meaning of showing off and displaying things and merits as a means to inadvertently show
      that they are not necessarily merited.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The unity of opposites
      • The Tao as a balanced combination of contrasting elements
      • The ontological aspect of opposites: a thing exists because its opposite exists
      • The epistemic aspect of opposites: it is possible to know a thing if its opposite is known
      • The figure of the Sage
      • The role of non-action (wu wei)
      • Merits and credits as unrequested claims
      • The role of words, eg: in teaching.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Other views on the unity of opposites, eg: Cusanus’s coincidentia oppositorum
      • Other dialectics of oppositions, eg: Hegel, Jung, Eliade
      • The relationship between Being and Non-being in other philosophical views, eg: Parmenides,
        Heidegger, Sartre
      • The role of words in language, eg: Wittgenstein
      • The meaning of claiming credits and merits as a means to show off in the society of
        consumerism and spectacle, eg: The Frankfurt School, Debord.

22.   (a)   Explain the claim that if you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal.               [10]

      (b)   Evaluate the claim that if you overvalue possessions, people begin to steal.              [15]

      The claim is from Chapter 3 and invites an exploration of the function of government according
      to the Tao. Candidates might explore the role of the Sage as ruler, who promotes stillness and
      contentment in society. Candidates might compare this view to other philosophical theories,
      eg: Plato’s Republic: the Sage must have an empty mind, directed to non-doing and not-desiring,
      not far from the philosopher-ruler depicted by Plato. Candidates might discuss the fact that not only
      the Sage’s mind must be emptied, but the Sage’s task is to empty the people’s minds too.
      Candidates might consider the role of education and learning and discuss other views,
      eg: paternalism and communitarianism. Candidates might highlight that promoting and overvaluing
      possessions would make people desire them and would make inequalities and fights rise in
      society. Unity and harmony must be promoted for the society’s sake. Candidates might present
      and compare other views, eg: contractarianism as in Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, or neo-
      contractarianism, as in Rawls and Nozick, or the role of property in governing and within society,
      as in Plato or Rousseau. Candidates might focus on the central concept of the Tao, non-action, as
      a ruling guide of the Sage: “Do Not-Doing and nothing will be left un-governed/Practice not-doing,
      and everything will fall into place”

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The figure of the Sage as a ruler
      • The importance of stillness and contentment
      • The task of emptying mind
      • Promoting incentives and possessions as linked to more inequalities and less harmony
      • Unity and harmony for the society’s sake
      • The importance of education and learning in society
      • Government following non-action.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • The ruler in other philosophical views, eg: Plato’s Republic
      • Criticism on possessions for the harmony of society, eg: Plato, Rousseau
      • Education and authoritarianism, paternalism, communitarianism
      • Contractarianism, eg: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and the importance of harmony in society
      • Neo-contractarianism, eg: Rawls, Nozick
      • Whether non-action can drive anarchy.

Zhuangzi: Zhuangzi, Inner Chapters

23.   (a)   Explain the metaphor of the magic bean and the giant gourd.                                  [10]

      (b)   Evaluate the metaphor of the magic bean and the giant gourd.                                 [15]

      Zhuangzi frequently uses metaphors to draw out philosophical perspectives and this question
      seeks an explanation of the magic bean and the gourd. In Chapter 1 of the Inner Chapters the
      central theme of ‘Going Beyond’, humans are encouraged to move away from their preconceptions
      that bind them. The rapid growth of the magic bean and the resulting giant gourd show how
      humans should strive to ‘go beyond’ and consider new and alternative uses of things- breaking
      conventional thinking. What use can a giant gourd be put to illustrates the problem and the inability
      of breaking out of conventional thinking. Such thinking seems to limit the gourd’s use and shows
      that there is failure to exploit the potentiality that exists. It is essentially an exercise in thinking
      ‘outside the box’. The large gourd is eventually broken into small pieces and seems to become
      useless because it had failed to be a useful container or a dipper: Limited thinking resulted in
      limited use. The opportunities for creative uses of things are continued in the metaphor that follows
      the gourd; the use of the balm. Throughout, Zhuangzi is trying to show that the master cannot think
      clearly; our minds, our thinking, our solution finding, can be limited by our preconceptions and our
      lack of creativity. This creativity is seen as spontaneity (ziran) and the lack of it is seen as a
      shortcoming of humans, and it results in discouraging paradigm shifts. More spontaneity means
      more change, and the acceptance of a changing fluid existence which is the essence of the Tao.
      The suggested potential use of a great gourd as a sailing raft is reflective of a creativity, it is the
      result of spontaneity (ziran) which Zhuangzi sees developing from the freeing of the mind, perhaps
      through wu wei. Effectively this is allowing the Tao to lead. The difference is all in the way things
      are used. The essence of the metaphor is to show that humans should try and escape from their
      predispositions and their initial priorities and see things completely differently, going beyond and
      being free to explore intellectually, without constraints.

      Candidates might explore (part A):

      • Zhuangzi’s view of ziran
      • The Tao and its ability to free humans from the everyday
      • Wu wei
      • The use of metaphors
      • The parallels with the story of the use of the balm
      • The relationship of failure and success in life
      • The idea of a flourishing life which entertains a non-material, non-ambition, or non-striving
        based success - a contentment.
      • Cultural influences on creative thinking and paradigm breaking; role of education and religion.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • The extent to which Zhuangzi has fixed perceptions, as he does not fully hold with illimitability of
        potential experience, as is characteristic of Confucius, as he trying to challenge Confucian
        traditions
      • Zhuangzi focuses on the exploitation of the gourd which is contrary to his more general position
        of stepping back and not interfering, wu wei- a non-engagement
      • Whether the practical and creative aspects of the metaphor show that the philosopher needs to
        be practical, realistic, and able to win support from potential patrons
      • Whether seeing useful aspects of the gourd is counter to Taoism
      • The degree to which spontaneity is an effective way of thinking
      • The appropriateness of a wu wei approach to living
      • The uncertainty and lack of fixed knowledge as positive to increasing ziran. Zhuangzi’s
        skepticism of knowledge is not doubting but, in the traditional Greek sense, an acceptance of
        uncertainty

• The relativistic nature of the metaphor and the fantasy aspect allowing freer thinking; effectively
  breaking the conventions of the time
• Whether Zhuangzi’s relativism and spontaneity, seen in the metaphor, encourages paradigm
  shifts
• The psychological issues associated with ‘categorical inflexibility’ (E. Slingerland in The Way of
  Nature C.C. Tsai).

24.   (a)   Explain Zhuangzi’s view of death.                                                            [10]

      (b)   Evaluate Zhuangzi’s view of death.                                                           [15]

      The question focuses largely on chapter 6 and invites an explanation of Zhuangzi’s view that death
      is merely a transformative process. For the Taoist death is an aspect of fate (ming). Therefore, the
      ability to face death is a sign of great virtuosity (de). There is an interrelationship between life and
      death, and death is not to be seen as an end but a transformational step in a larger natural
      process. Mention could be made to the story of how when death approaches, Ziya contemplates a
      transformation with his left arm becoming a rooster and his right arm a cross bow pellet. What is
      being posed here is that death is another step and is an aspect of change. At the heart of
      understanding this change process is the Taoist understanding of humans being part of the
      universe and upon death the essence of the human continues, but in a different form. The
      contemplation on death creates a view that if life is good then death is good. Humans consider
      themselves as important components of the universe, but the “Creation - Transform” sees them
      simply as a ‘clump of person’, ready to be transformed again. For the Taoist, death is a return to
      nature. Life is achieving a balance between human activity and nature. What seems to continue
      through transformation is the essence. There is throughout Zhuangzi’s views on death an implied
      criticism of the ritual approaches developed by Confucius. Mourning and distress at the loss does
      not seem appropriate in Taoism. There might also be reference to the ‘Butterfly Dream’ relating to
      life and death, and whether the processes of living are seemingly dreams. Similarly, there might be
      mention of Zilai’s impending death and what transformations await, a mouse’s liver or an insect’s
      arm. There seems no need to challenge, question or even fear death as it is the way to heaven, to
      change. It is an acceptance of the Tao. This acceptance and non-response to death links to
      notions of wu wei, and a peaceful contentment to an ongoing natural process. Contrasts might be
      made to various religious views towards death particularly Christian ideas of an afterlife and Hindu
      views on reincarnation.

      Candidates might explore (part A):
      • The ‘clump of person’ reference and links to the eternal black smith
      • The images of transformation, the rooster, and positive future possibilities after human life
      • The nature of the cosmos and a human’s place within it
      • Consideration of the essence of all things, the Tao
      • Taoism and nature
      • Wu wei and the idea of non-action, non-interference, accepting the flow of nature, the Tao
      • ‘The great clump’ and the human physical form as just a chance encounter and perhaps a
        burden
      • The personal experience of the death with reference to Zhuangzi’s wife and his reaction to her
        death and mourning
      • Yin and Yang and life and death
      • The consequences of no deity and no notion of an afterlife
      • Links between friendship and death.

      Possible discussion points include (part B):
      • Contrasts with Confucianism, rituals and death, and the Taoist views of filiality
      • Contrasting views on Nature (tian), and the human relationship to nature; Confucius's view of
        the relationship to nature is one of ordering (Li ), whereas for the Taoist it is one of acceptance
        of being part of or being within nature
      • Whether close friendship gives justification for mourning (reference to Zilai’s death)
      • Taoist views on the cosmos and human’s place within it
      • Contrasts with Plato’s views on the immorality of souls
      • Reactions to Zhuangzi’s understanding of continuity and change in the context of his wife’s
        death; some would be perplexed by his lack of sorrow
      • Humans as part of nature and the consequential perspective of death as a process

•   Whether Zhuangzi’s approach to death provides solace
•   The degree to which views of death are weighted by cultural mores and expectations
•   Religious stances and death: the afterlife, heaven and hell, reincarnation, parallel universes
•   New Age thinking and cycles of nature as a cosmological process.
