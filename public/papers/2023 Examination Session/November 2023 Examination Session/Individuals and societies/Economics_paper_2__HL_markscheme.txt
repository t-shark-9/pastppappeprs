Notes for examiners:

1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.
2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you
should put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.
3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct
to 2 dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may
only be penalized ONCE per question (not per part) for each type of error.

Command term
“Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with
appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Definitions may include:
Economic growth
Economic development.

Economic models to support analysis may include:
• Lorenz curve diagram
• AD/AS diagram
• Poverty cycle
• PPC
• Externality diagrams – positive production and negative production
• Export subsidy diagram
• Production subsidy diagram
• Income elasticity of demand – Engel’s curve
• Opportunity cost.

Possible policies may include a discussion on some of the following:

General arguments – policies effective:
• 4% consistent economic growth for 20 years (Text A, paragraph 1)
• Positive environment impact (Text A, paragraph 1, Happy Planet Index – Table 2)
• Higher value-added products lead to higher incomes and higher income elasticity
  (Text A, paragraph 4)
• Absolute Poverty rates decrease (Text A, paragraph 1)
• Become a global leader in conservation efforts (Text A, paragraph 1)
• Is one of the countries with the greatest biodiversity in the word (Text C paragraph 1).

General arguments - policies ineffective:
• Poverty has remained unchanged for a number of years (Text B, paragraph 1, Table 2)
• Income inequality remains high (Text B, paragraph 1, IHDI compared to HDI data, Table
  2)
• Number of students not completing school (Text B, paragraph 1)
• Lack of jobs for low skilled workers having a disproportionate impact on youth and
  women (Text B, paragraph 1)
• Government unable to redistribute income effectively due to tax system (Text B,
  paragraph 1)
• Social programmes not reaching the very poor (Text B, paragraph 1)
• High Government debt (Text B, paragraph 2, Table 1)
• Continued focus on growth may inhabit the country’s ability to meet environmental
  objectives (Text C, paragraph 1)
• Although HPI is at rank 1 the index has decreased which means a deterioration
  (Table 2)
• Unemployment increasing, (Table 1, Text A, paragraph 2)
• Import substitution failed (Text A paragraph 1).

Export diversification
• Export subsidies for those in manufacturing (Text A, paragraph 4)
• However, firms may become reliant on the subsidies leading to long term allocative
  inefficiencies
• Jobs created in the manufacturing sector as a result. New skills learnt (Text A,
  paragraph 4)
• Focus on higher valued products and the manufacturing sector only created jobs for
  high-skill workers (Text B paragraph 1)
• Government subsidies unsustainable due to high government debt (Text B paragraph 2)
• Pollution from increased manufacturing sector (Text C, paragraph 1)
• Difficulty meeting carbon emissions reductions (Text C, paragraph 1).

Agricultural diversification to higher valued goods
• Subsidies for new technology and high valued goods allows farmers to become more
  productive, competitive and earn higher revenue (Text A, paragraph 4)
• However, farmers may become reliant on the subsidies leading to long term allocative
  inefficiencies (Text A, paragraph 4)
• New technology may replace workers – leading to unemployment. Structural
  unemployment as the industry changes (Text A, paragraph 4)
• Focus on higher valued products and the manufacturing sector only created jobs for
  high-skill workers (Text B paragraph 1)
• Government subsidies unsustainable due to high government debt (Text B paragraph 2)
• Overuse of land leading to sustainability issues (Text C, paragraph 1)
• Use of production subsidies for employing new technology to produce higher
  value-added products (Text A, paragraph 4).

Trade Liberalization
• Secured reliable framework for trade with US and a predictable environment, may
   encourage more exports, investment and increased business confidence, leading to
   increased AD resulting in economic growth (Text A, paragraph 2)
• However, overreliance on the US (Text B, paragraph 3)
• Monopolies dismantled (Text A, paragraph 2), may benefit consumers with a more
   competitive environment, lower prices, more choice, decreased welfare loss. As it is
   insurance and telecommunications, this may increase standard of living for some
   citizens
• General trade agreements - may increase variety of goods, lower prices - for consumers
   and producers, or increase exports (Text A, paragraph 2)
• Increased exports may threaten biodiversity (Text C, paragraph 1).

Foreign Direct Investment
• FDI allowed for the transition to higher valued products (from agriculture to
  manufacturing, possibly leading to higher incomes helping to break the poverty cycle
  (Text A, paragraph 3)
• Foreign firms trained domestic workers, increasing human capital, productivity which
  may help to break the poverty cycle/LRAS and PPC impact (Text A, paragraph 3)
• Multiplier impact of the investment (Text A, paragraph 3)
• Tax exemptions result in poor government revenue – contributed to poverty and
  government lacks resources to redistribute income (Text B, paragraph 1)
• FDI encouraged the focus on higher valued products and the manufacturing sector only
  created jobs for high-skill workers (Text B, paragraph 1)
• Limited/unsustainable due to higher costs and poor infrastructure (Text B paragraph 3)
• Increased FDI may threaten biodiversity (Text C, paragraph 1).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
appropriate, should be rewarded.

A maximum of [9] should be awarded if only economic growth or economic development is
discussed.

Command term
“Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with
appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Definitions may include:
• Economic growth
• Economic development
• Social enterprise
• Microfinance.

Economic models to support analysis may include:
• PPC
• Lorenz curve
• AD/AS diagram
• Poverty cycle
• Circular flow
• Externality diagrams
• YED, Engel's curve
• Circular economy.

Discussion may include analysis and evaluation based on some of the following:

Social Enterprise:
• May provide opportunities for youth and help with high youth unemployment rate (Text D,
  paragraph 2)
• Increase human capital (Text D, paragraph 2)
• Decrease reliance on garment industry (Text D, paragraph 3)
• Hindered by tax laws (Text E, paragraph 3)
• Infrastructure may not support new enterprises (Text D, paragraph 5)
• Due to the environmental objectives of SEs this may help solve the market failure
  associated with garment industry (Text D, paragraph 4)
• SE objectives could support the growth of the ecotourism sector (Text D, paragraph 4, Text
  E, paragraph 2)
• Needed to fill the gap of withdrawn aid (Text E, paragraph 1)
• Addresses many development issues such as health, education, clean water, sanitation,
  (Text E, paragraph 2) (Text 2 paragraph 2)
• Problems with funding and skilled labour limit success rate, could be an inefficient use of
  resources. Text E, paragraph 3)
• May stay in the informal sector, not contributing to tax revenue or access government
  support and workers lack protection in the informal sector (Text E, paragraph 3)
• May encourage more domestic investment (Table 3), less reliance on FDI.
• Success could be hindered by minimum wage increase (Text D, paragraph 3)
• Help solve current labour market needs (Text D, paragraph 5).
                                            – 22 –                                    8823 – 5104M


Microfinance:
• Helped when aid was withdrawn (Text F, paragraph 1)
• Provides a means of credit for rural poor (Text D, paragraph 2) which may help decrease
  inequalities
• Helps solve asymmetric information (Text F, paragraph 1)
• May encourage more domestic investment (Table 3), less reliance on FDI.
• Creates problems of household indebtedness for some (Text F, paragraph 1)
• May need government intervention (interest rates) which causes inefficiencies in the market
  and less access to loans. (Text F, paragraph 2)
• Microfinance could be used to fund SE. (Text E, paragraph 3)
• Positive relationship between number of loans and GDP per capita (Text F, paragraph 1,
  Table 4)
• Indebtedness may cause the poor to lose assets (Text F, paragraph 2)
• Microfinance could be used to support the development of the ecotourism industry and take
  advantage of the high-income elasticity of demand.
• lack of financial literacy and skill hampers level of impact of microfinance (Text F,
  paragraph 2) (Table 3)
• Increasing costs/interest rates may inhibit success or ability to access microfinance (Text F,
  paragraph 2).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if appropriate,
should be rewarded.

A maximum of [9] should be awarded if only economic growth or economic development
or only considers social enterprise or microcredit.
