The following interpretation of the markscheme is offered as an example of the types of responses we
may expect, however it is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and other possible answers should be
appropriately rewarded if relevant.

1.   Define the term cultural relativism and describe how it can be understood and applied in the
     context of the passage.                                                                           [4]

     This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and understanding
     of the term cultural relativism and apply it in relation to the text. Candidates may write in
     terms of any of the following guidelines, but other definitions or applications will also be
     acceptable if made relevant to the context of the passage.

     Possible ways of defining the term:
     • As the assumption that each culture has its own internal logic
     • As the understanding of meaning in context
     • Not making value judgments about cultural difference
     • Making reference to Franz Boas’ notion of cultural relativism.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples of description and application:
     • The ethnographer’s acceptance of religious conservatism
     • The ethnographer’s value judgments regarding marriage offers
     • Assumptions regarding ethnicity and language
     • The reflexivity of the ethnographer regarding her reactions.

     Other appropriate applications should be credited.

         Marks      Level descriptor
           0        The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
          1–2       The response demonstrates a basic knowledge and understanding of the
                      concept.
                    There is a partial application of the concept in relation to the text.
          3–4       The response demonstrates sound knowledge and understanding of the
                      concept; the concept is described in detail.
                    The concept is clearly applied in relation to the text.
                                                 –4–                                       8823 – 5803M


2.   Explain how the key concept of power helps you understand the ethnographic data presented in
     the passage.                                                                                [6]

     This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this ethnographic text
     using the key concept power to help make sense of the ethnographic data. In order to do this,
     candidates are required to demonstrate an understanding of the key concept and use it to
     illuminate certain issues within the context of the passage, developing an analysis with reference to
     the ethnographic data of the extract.

     Possible ways of defining the key concept:
     • Power is an essential part of social relations and can be considered as a person's or
       group's capacity to influence, manipulate or control others and resources
     • In its broadest sense, power can be understood as involving distinctions and
       inequalities between members of a social group
     • Some approaches to power focus on structural power or the capacity of power to
       produce subjectivities.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples and ways of analyzing:
     • State power
     • Structural violence
     • Resistance
     • Power dynamics in the field
     • The (western) researcher transcending local gender norms
     • Religious authority

     Other appropriate examples and ways of analyzing should be credited.

        Marks       Level descriptor
          0         The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
         1–2        The response offers a common-sense or superficial understanding of the
                       key concept.
                    There is an attempt to relate the key concept to the text, and some
                       ethnographic examples are presented but these are only partially
                       relevant.
          3–4       The response demonstrates an understanding of the key concept and
                       establishes its relevance to the text.
                    There is an analysis of the text using the key concept, although there are
                       some inconsistencies.
                    Relevant ethnographic examples from the text are presented to support the
                       analysis.
          5–6       The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concept,
                       discussing this in the context of the text.
                    There is a clearly explained analysis of the text using the key concept and a
                       detailed interpretation of the ethnographic data.
                    Clear and explicit ethnographic examples from the text support the analysis.
                                                  –5–                                        8823 – 5803M


3.   Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of social relations or identity is
     evident in this passage with how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you have
     studied.                                                                                         [10]

     This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this
     ethnographic text using the key concept social relations or identity to help make sense of
     the ethnographic data. In order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an
     understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain issues within the context of
     the passage, developing an analysis with reference to the ethnographic data of the extract.

     Candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other
     contexts and to draw explicit comparisons. In order to do this, responses must demonstrate
     an understanding of how either the key concept of social relations or identity relates to
     this ethnographic context. Either of the key concepts on which such comparison may be
     drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any anthropological issues raised by
     the text.

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates should
     be able to establish a relevant comparison with any other group or society based on either
     of these concepts. The response should be structured as a comparison, highlighting
     similarities and differences. Candidates must situate the comparative case in terms of
     place, author, and fieldwork context.

     For social relations, possible ways of defining the key concept include the following:
     • Any relationship between two or more individuals in a network of relationships
     • Social relations involve an element of individual agency as well as group
       expectations and form the basis of social organization and social structure
     • They pervade every aspect of human life and are extensive, complex, and diverse.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples from the text about social relations may include the following:
     • Social relations and religious groups
     • Marriage and kinship
     • Field relations
     • Socialization/acculturation into social groups.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.


     For identity, possible ways of defining the key concept include the following:

     • Identity can refer either to the individual’s private and personal view of the self—this
       is sometimes referred to as the “moi”—or the view of an individual in the eyes of the
       social group.
     • Identity also refers to group identity, which may take the form of religious identity,
       ethnic identity, or national identity for example.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

Possible examples from the text about identity may include:
• Religious identity
• Secular identity
• National identity
• Gender
• Insider/outsider
• Fieldworker identity and how it is conceptualized by participants.

Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

4.   Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in
     this passage with the approaches to research used by one other anthropologist you
     have studied. Make reference to concepts and ethnographic material in your answer.           [10]

     Here, candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text with emphasis on
     the methodological and theoretical perspectives of the ethnographer as the focus on which
     such comparisons should be established.

     By “approaches to research” the question essentially refers to the research methods used
     by the anthropologist to gather data

     Possible comparative examples regarding approaches to research and
     methodological terms may include:

     •   Participant observation
     •   informal/ethnographic interviews
     •   gender
     •   tensions between ethnographer and the state
     •   qualitative methods
     •   insider/outsider
     •   access to the field
     •   local categories/analytical categories
     •   positionality
     •   field relationships
     •   reflexivity
     •   representation.

5.   To what extent is knowing others possible? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of
     ethnographic material and examples from the passage.                                         [10]

     This question requires candidates to develop an argument that is built on an
     understanding of the following “big anthropological question”: To what extent is
     knowing others possible? This response should include argumentative discussion and
     analysis and should be supported by making reference to the passage and by relevant,
     detailed ethnographic material that gives evidence of the understanding of this big
     question in different cultural contexts. This big anthropological question should be the
     very backbone of the response.

     In the development of their response, candidates may make reference to a number of
     ideas or propositions connected to the question. For this reason, below are some ideas
     that may appear in candidates’ responses. However, any other relevant lines of thought
     should be rewarded.

     Possible issues to develop an argument may be:
     There are many different ways that candidates can approach this question, and any
     valid discussion of similarities and differences underpinned by anthropological
     knowledge and understanding should be considered.

     While it is not possible to predict how candidates will use any additional ethnographies,
     in relation to the passage they may focus on:

     •   Gender
     •   Religion
     •   Secularization
     •   Cultural Relativism
     •   Change
     •   Power
     •   Memory and history

     Other appropriate discussion and arguments should be credited.
