Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

Option A — Databases

1.   (a)   Award [4 max]
           Data can be structured/normalised/referential integrity;
           So that the quality/consistency/integrity of data is maintained;

           Databases allow data to be integrated from multiple sources;
           Data can be exported in different formats/be used in other applications;

           Concurrency can be ensured;
           So that multiple users can make changes to the database at the same time

           A database can load from storage only the data needed;
           A spreadsheet will load all the data into RAM;

           Data can be searched/queried by multiple fields;
           Using advanced search features/SQL can be used;

           Databases allow the creation of views;
           To improve data privacy;

           Mark as [2] and [2]


     (b)   Award [2 max]
           Dates will be sorted by year first, then month, then day;
           Dates sorted by day or month first will be out of sequence/accept an example 28/01/20,
           28/04/19, 28/09/20;
           This is the internationally accepted way to represent dates/ISO standard;
           Appropriate, if integrating data with other systems/databases;


     (c)   Award [3 max]
           Using a composite key eliminates the need for an extra field;
           OrderlineID primary key creates additional storage;
           Unlikely to search by OrderlineID/OrderlineID is a meaningless field;
           OrderID and ItemID are natural entities since they relate to one order;
           If the client orders the same meal another time the OrderID will be different;


     (d)   Award [2 max]
           The program may not know which UnitPrice is being referenced;
           This would cause an error message to be display/the query would not execute;
           It will be necessary to state the table name with the UnitPrice;

2.    (a)   Award [3 max]
            The user may type in the wrong amount;
            LinePrice should be a derived field/calculated field//=[Quantiy] * [UnitPrice];
            It is not necessary to store this data/wastes storage space;
            The relation/table does not conform to 3NF;

      (d)   Award [4 max]
            Only allow waiters to view work hours not approve them during a shift;
            Writing to the table could only be open at the end of the shift/set times;
            The database could be set to lock the record/table while it is being edited;
            So the waiter could not approve the hours while they are edited;
            The database could be set to block viewing while the table is being edited;
            A message could be conveyed to the waiter that the data is being updated;
            Two-phase locking can be applied to guarantee full isolation of the update;

      Instant recovery/Recovery in place;
      A snapshot is created so the backup remains in a correct state;
      All user write operations are redirected to that snapshot;
      Users then work off the backup virtual machine (VM);

      When the recovery is complete the workload is directed back to the original VM;

      Crash recovery;
      If a crash occurs mid-transaction;
      The system follows a protocol/algorithm to recover lost data;
      A check is made of the states of the transactions that were being executed;
      If the transaction can be completed it should do so;
      If not the transactions that were interrupted during the crash are rolled back;
      No transaction can be allowed to leave in an inconsistent state;

     (c)   Award [6 max]
           Apply a heat map filter (red for hot and yellow for cooler);
           This shows the density of emergency calls;
           The method used (e.g. Nature breaks, Quantile) can provide different maps;
           Depending upon the colour key the maps can appear very different;

           Filter by variable (e.g. type of emergency);
           This would only show the dots for that emergency type;
           This may show if there an outbreak in one area;
           Emergency vehicles could be located near these areas;
           There may be confounding data like population density;

           Filter by time would show emergencies over a time period;
           May be useful if an annual event (e.g. protest, concert) is due;
           The data from the previous year can be analysed;
           To assist with the deployment of emergency vehicles/increase police presence in those
           areas to reduce emergencies;

           Mark as [3] and [3].


     (d)   Award [5 max]
           Negative
           Many people look at a map and believe that it is an objective truth;
           They aren’t aware that the data can be filtered to change the appearance;
           Thus, map data should always include a key and other objective data;

           Positive
           If the agenda has a positive impact, then it is fine to use these tools;
           e.g. show all crime (even minor crime) to boost the funding for emergency services;
           May make it easier for decision makers to understand the data;
           Which in turn, may save lives;

           Conclusion
           It is ethical to use all tools at your disposal. The opposition may also use these tools;
           You run the risk that a counter map will be produced showing a very different perspective to
           yours;

      Detection deviation is any usual pattern in the data/look for cases that are outside of the
      norm;
      These deviations are compared against historical data over time;
      e.g. Fires are clustered in one region;
      e.g. Fires occur at certain times of the year;
      The model should try to ignore random patterns (noise);

       Award [3 max] for advantages
       Award [3 max] for disadvantages
       Award [1 max] for conclusion

       Advantages
       Spreadsheet reduces the likelihood of calculation mistakes;
       You can clearly see which cat is chosen;
       You could create a graph to visualise the results;
       Formulas can be changed easily e.g. if you change your decision making;
       (e.g. always reject the first two cat, accept the third cat if higher than the first two, else
       choose the fourth cat;)

       Disadvantages
       There is no easy way to calculate ordered permutations/permutations need to be entered
       manually;
       May lead to errors if the formula needs to be changed e.g. If statements changed to reflect
       decision-making;
       (e.g. always reject the first two cat, accept the third cat if higher than the first two, else
       choose the fourth cat;)

       Conclusion
       Works well when there are only 3 or 4 cats;
       For more than 4 cats it is unrealistic to model using a spreadsheet;

      Machine translation is based on learning patterns from large datasets of translated
      passages;
      More data is stored in English and French//more translations from English to French have
      been completed;
      Thus, the AI algorithms have more training data from which to learn;

      The AI is likely to use English as an intermediate for translation from Bengali to Polish;
      Because there are more datasets of Bengali to English and English to Polish than Bengali to
      Polish;
      This increases the likelihood of translation errors;

      Bengali and Polish use different alphabets, whereas English and French use very similar

            Cost saving;
            Cloud storage results in reduction of storage and operative costs;
            As organisations can cut on expensive hardware requirement needed in a client-server
            network architecture;
            Also internal power and maintenance costs are reduced;

            Accessibility;
            Cloud storage allows an organisation to access the stored files from anywhere increasing the
            accessibility and usability;
            Users can easily drop files to save in the cloud storage;

      Ownership Concentration:
      Cloud storage has expanded geographically;
      But is predominantly controlled by major providers, which challenges the extent of
      decentralization;
      The perceived spread of data centres is overshadowed by the consolidation of ownership
      and control,
      Which can lead to increased market share for digital oligarchs;
      The trend of businesses transitioning from local or distributed storage to centralized cloud
      services may decrease the diversity of storage solutions;


      Challenges to Decentralization:
      Centralized data in the cloud presents significant security risks, which can impede
      decentralization efforts due to the attractive target it presents for cyber threats;
      A lack of adopted standards for interoperability across different platforms hinders the
      possibility of a decentralized web ecosystem;
      The economic advantages that large-scale providers have due to their size can dissuade the
      shift towards a more decentralized infrastructure;

      Impact on Innovation:
      The control exercised by a few large cloud providers can create high barriers to entry,
      potentially stifling innovation in the sector;

      Data Sovereignty:
      Data storage by centralized cloud services in various international locations raises issues of
      data sovereignty;
      Affected by differing local laws and practices;

      Network Effects:
      The strong network effects associated with the services of large providers enhance their
      value as more users join;
      Reinforcing the centralization of the web;

      Conclusion:
      Decentralization may remain limited until peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies become
      more mainstream and offer a viable alternative to centralized cloud storage;
      Environmental concerns over the distributed computing model may challenge its adoption,
      with its benefits needing to outweigh its carbon footprint;
      Government regulations could significantly impact the trajectory towards decentralization,
      either by imposing barriers or by encouraging diversified storage practices;
      A cultural shift towards prioritizing data privacy and control may catalyze movements towards
      a more decentralized web structure.

            Greater access to health-related data can lead to increased patient engagement in their
            healthcare through forums and support networks;
            Patients may improve their health literacy by learning more about conditions and healthcare
            systems online;
            The abundance of online health data can cause information overload, leading to patient
            confusion or decision-making stress;
            The doctor-patient relationship dynamics may shift as patients bring web-sourced information
            into consultations;
            A disparity in health outcomes could emerge between those who can effectively access and
            use online health data and those who cannot;
            Exposure to online health information may prompt patients to adopt preventive health
            measures and lifestyle changes;
            Patients might become reliant on online resources for health monitoring, potentially altering
            traditional healthcare interactions;
            Risks of personal health data misuse may increase with patients sharing information on
            unsecured or public web platforms;
            The web may encourage exploration of alternative and holistic treatments, which aren't
            always backed by scientific evidence;
            Some users may resort to self-diagnosis and potential self-medication based on online data;
            However, the reliability of such data may be questionable, and users might lack the expertise
            to verify it, leading to potential health risks;
            Contrarily, some users might distrust the voluminous health data online or feel overwhelmed
            by the complexity of navigating it;
            The varied changes in user behavior due to increased online health data may complicate the
            ability of health services to anticipate and plan for future healthcare demands.

      many monsters may be “created” and “destroyed” during the game);

      Not good for modelling situations in which only single objects/instances are needed;

18.   (a)   Award [4 max]

            Speed/order of access:
            A stack is accessed in LIFO order whereas a Linked List is traversed starting from
            the first node;
            Therefore, a stack would allow faster access to the most recent turns to ‘rewind’;

            Method of access:
            To access an element, it must be removed (popped) from stack, whereas a Linked
            List can be read without removal;
            Therefore, if a stack is used the removed items would have to be added again in the
            correct order to gameLog;

            Mark as [2] and [2]

(b)   Award [6 max]
      Award [1] for testing if the requested number of turns is bigger than the size of the Linked
      List / gameLog
      Award [1] for giving a reason (either Linked List is front access only or the potentially invalid
      request)
      Award [1] for outputting an error message if the requested number of turns is bigger than the
      size of the Linked List / gameLog
      Award [1] for giving a valid reason (telling the user that it is an invalid request)
      Award [1] for finding the first turn (the earliest turn) to be undone / rewinded
      Award [1] for giving a valid reason (to have a starting point for the loop to rewind the turns)
      Award [1] for looping through the remaining turns (of the Linked List / gameLog)
      Award [1] for testing If the defender (or 'to' monster) equals / is rewinder
      Award [1] for adding the (turn's) damage to the health of the 'to' monster / rewinder
      Award [1] for giving a valid reason (to undo the damage only when the rewinder is the
      defender)

      Note to examiners: accept explanations that use code to support the explanation.

      Example answer:

      First count the number of turns in the linked List;
      Because the new turns are added to the end of gameLog and you cannot easily
      access a Linked List from the rear;
      Give an error message if the number of turns counted is lower than
      numberOfTurns;
      Because then that number of turns cannot be rewinded;
      Loop backwards to find the first turn to be undone;
      In order to have a starting point for rewinding the turns;
      Loop through the remaining turns in the list;
      In each turn, if the defender is equal to rewinder;
      Then add the damage back to rewinder.health so that the turns are skipped
      where rewinder is the attacker;
