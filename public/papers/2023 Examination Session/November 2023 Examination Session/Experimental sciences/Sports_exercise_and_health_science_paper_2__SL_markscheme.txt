Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in Section B [20 marks].
Maximum total = [50 marks].

Markscheme format example:


     Question                                      Answers                                                    Notes                     Total

5      c    ii    this refers to the timing of the movements
                  OR
                  the extent to which the performer has control over the timing of the
                  movement ✔                                                                                                           2 max

                  external paced skills are sailing/windsurfing/receiving a serve ✔
                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine ✔


1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.
                                                                               –4–                                                             8823 – 6605M


8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail an d validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

e.g., a smaller/ less physically mature individual may lack the height/ mechanics to
jump over a high jump bar✔
e.g., a toddler doesn’t have the running skills to dribble a football/ basketball with
control✔
Physical fitness
players need the stamina/flexibility/coordination to practice/ learn/ execute skills✔
rate of learning will be slow if performers lack the necessary fitness component✔
e.g., lack of flexibility will prevent learning/executing the pike in trampolining✔
Age
age of players can affect their experience / mental ability to understand and apply
tactics✔
Rate of learning decreases as an adult ages
OR
Rate of learning increases as child ages towards adulthood✔
e.g., younger players may pick skills up quickly and be uninhibited by previously
learnt poor techniques
OR
e.g., older players may pick up skills more quickly as they have the ability to adapt
and apply previously learnt skills✔
Coach:
the style of coaching can determine whether the players will learn effectively✔
e.g., a dictatorial coach may hinder the players’ ability to apply skills when they
play the game as the players have to make decisions by themselves in a fluid/
game situation✔
e.g., a coach who only provides negative feedback may turn players off from being
involved✔
Difficulty of task
rate of learning may be slow if the task is too difficult/ unobtainable✔
e.g., rolling a ball along the floor compared to kicking a ball moving towards you✔
