      A new vaccine has been distributed that would be of benefit to some of the doctor’s patients.
      A large number of personalized letters need to be written to these patients, inviting them to
      visit the doctor’s practice to be vaccinated.

      (c)   Describe how these letters could be automatically generated by a word
            processing application.                                                                         [3]

      When the doctor visits a patient in their home, she needs to be able to access the patient’s
      medical records stored on the central computer in the practice.

      (d)   Outline two reasons for the use of a virtual private network (VPN) in this situation.           [4]

      A mobile data connection enables the doctor to access internet resources while visiting
      patients in their homes. Sometimes the data transfer speeds are slow.

      (e)   Explain why the speed of data transmission across a mobile network can vary.                    [3]


11.   A systems analyst has been employed to make proposals on how to improve the current

      by the systems analyst.

      (c)   Explain why software testing is important at all stages of implementation.                     [3]

      Using images in design may have ethical considerations.

      (d)   Explain one ethical problem associated with using images.                                      [3]

      Images are sometimes larger than the limit placed on email attachments. For example,
      a 60 MB image file needs to be sent by email without losing quality, but a file larger than
      10 MB cannot be uploaded as an attachment.

      (e)   (i)	Describe how large image files can be sent by email.                                     [3]

            the microprocessor.                                                                            [2]

      The traffic lights at the crossroads are also connected to a microprocessor. A person who
      wishes to cross the road presses a button at a traffic light. This causes an interrupt.

      (c)   (i)	Outline what is meant by an interrupt.                                                   [2]

            (ii)   Explain how the microprocessor can deal with this interrupt.                            [3]

13.   A programmer is developing a program to record information about patients as they arrive at
      the emergency department of a hospital.

      Due to the unplanned nature of patient attendance, the emergency department must provide
      treatment for a range of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be critical and require
      immediate attention.

      The programmer decided to use a linked list for storing the patients’ data.

      (a)   Describe the structure of a linked list.                                                        [2]

      (b)   Explain why a queue data structure is not suitable in this situation.                           [3]

      The information about the most seriously ill patient is held at the beginning of the linked list.

      The linked list should be updated as each new patient arrives at the emergency department.

      (c)   Describe how the linked list should be updated if a new patient arrives at the
            emergency department with more serious symptoms than all the other patients.                    [3]

      (d)   Describe how the linked list should be updated if a new patient arrives at the
            emergency department and has more serious symptoms than some patients but less
            serious symptoms than others.                                                                   [4]

      (e)   Compare static and dynamic data structures.                                                     [3]

14.   There are 20 gymnasts who took part in a gymnastics competition.

      Competitors were assessed by 8 judges who each awarded a score in a range from 0–10.
      The judges were numbered 0–7. The competitors’ names are stored in the one-dimensional
      array NAMES, and their scores are stored in the two-dimensional array SCORES (see Figure 1).

                      Figure 1: Data held in the NAMES array and the SCORES array

                    NAMES                                           SCORES

                      …                                                   …
      [18]      Lee, Mae              [18]     8.2    8.0    6.9    6.9       8.1   6.9    7.9   8.2

      For example, the score that Judge 4 awarded to Mary Tann (NAMES[1]) is 8.9 and can be
      found in SCORES[1][4].

      (a)     State the judge who awarded the highest score to the competitor Tea Fox.                   [1]

      The highest attainable score in gymnastics is 10.0 .

      (b)     Construct an algorithm that determines and outputs the number of times the highest
              attainable score was awarded in this competition.                                          [4]

      A competitor’s final score is calculated by ignoring the highest and the lowest mark awarded
      and averaging the remaining marks.

      For example, the highest mark awarded to Lilly Bush was 7.9, and the lowest mark was 6.9,
      so her final score was (7.2 + 6.9 + 6.9 + 6.9 + 6.9 + 7.2) / 6.

      (c)     Construct an algorithm in pseudocode to output the name and the final score for
              every competitor.                                                                        [10]
