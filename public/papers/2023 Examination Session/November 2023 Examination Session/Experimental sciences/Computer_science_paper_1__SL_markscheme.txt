Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
   accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
   that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
   rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
   In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
   is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
   “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.

            scanning technology)/which prevents random persons logging into the system;

            Most security breaches are a consequence of human factors (negligence or simple “human”
            error);
            This can be prevented by security awareness training for the doctor and receptionist/
            precautionary measures when handling patient data;

      before giving the access to data;

      VPN allows access to any content in any place;

      VPNs usually have intuitive and user-friendly interface;
      So, it makes installation and use easy for the doctor (non-technical user);

      VPN is adaptable to many smart devices/protects smart devices such as phones, tablets and
      laptops;

      because the number of other users in the area using the same network (during certain hours,
      there are many users, which causes the connection speed to slow down);
      because of the location of user with respect to cell towers (the speed may change because
      the signal varies depending on the coverage area);

                   Surveys are a practical/fast way to gather information from a large group of people
                   about something specific in the company (which gives a good composition of data)/
                   anonymity (confidentiality) thus allowing the respondents to express their opinions
                   freely/surveys provide fast results because of today’s mobile and online tools this
                   method of data collection can generate results quickly;
                   it is difficult/time consuming/costly/ineffective to collect all the specific data interviewing
                   all the end users/analysis of collected data will take more time;

                   Observation allows the entire graphic design company to account for all processes
                   (parts/participants)/gives more realistic view than interview/can highlight aspects that
                   are not detected in interviews/helps to speed up the work of collecting information/
                   helps to prove or disprove an idea while keeping the overall costs of the collection
                   of information down;

            Software needs to be tested with typical/extreme/invalid data so when the client (graphic
            design company) gets to use it most (or all) of the errors have been corrected;
            this can save money (if bugs are caught in the earlier stages, it costs much less to fix them);
            this adds to security/the client gets a trustworthy application (keeps client’s information and
            data safe)/vulnerability free - problems and risks are eliminated beforehand;

            Accept examples, such as, use (file compression software like) 7-Zip to create an
            archive containing that 60MB file, splitting it into eight 7.5 MB pieces then use a file
            extraction program to extract file and piece it back together.

            Use file-sharing services (Google Drive/OneDrive);
            upload the large file to the cloud;
            and share the link;

            use an online storage service (that doesn’t integrate directly with an email provider/
            Dropbox);
            upload the large file and “share link”;
            then just paste the link into your email (and the recipient will be able to access the file
            by clicking it);

            Labar, Tanya or Tanya Labar;

      (b)   Award [3 max].

            Award [1] for initializing all the variables used
            Award [1] for a correct loop.
            Award [1] for calculating sum using correct array index.
            Award [1] for calculating the average.

            Example 1:

            SUM=0
            K=0
            loop while K <= 9   //Accept SCORES.length()-1
                SUM = SUM + SCORES[K]
                K = K + 1
            end loop
            AVERAGE = SUM / 10 //Accept use of SCORES.length() or a counter variable

            Example 2:

            S=0
            loop K from 0 to 9
                S = S + SCORES[K]
            end loop
            S = S / 10

            Award [1] for output

            COUNT=0
            loop K from 0 to 9
                if SCORES[K]>AVERAGE then
                     COUNT=COUNT+1
            end loop
            output COUNT
