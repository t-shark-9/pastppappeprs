Option A — Databases

1.   A restaurant stores information about its customers, their orders and the meals available
     in a database.

     (a)     Outline two reasons why the restaurant would use a database to store this information
             rather than a spreadsheet.                                                                      [4]

     An extract of some data to be stored is displayed in the table.

            Customer          DateOfVisit             Item                Item              Item

           Duncan Mark        2021/08/18       Fish and Chips           Pavlova             Wine

           Duncan Mark        2021/08/18       Steak and Salad           Sorbet             None

           Akemi Watene       2021/08/18       Chicken Biriyani          Wine               None



     The DateOfVisit field is stored as year, month, day (yyyy/mm/dd).

     (b)     Outline one benefit of storing the data in the DateOfVisit field in the order of yyyy/mm/dd. [2]

     The table structure for the restaurant database is:

     CUSTOMER(CustomerID, FirstName, Surname, Phone, Email)
     ORDER(OrderID, OrderDate, OrderTime, CustomerID)
     ORDERLINE(OrderID, ItemID, Quantity, UnitPrice, LinePrice)
     ITEM(ItemID, Name, QtyInStock, UnitPrice)

     In the ORDERLINE table, OrderID and ItemID have been selected as a composite primary
     key. An alternative solution would be to use an OrderlineID primary key.

     (c)     Outline the reason for using OrderID and ItemID instead of OrderlineID as the
             primary key.                                                                                    [3]

     The UnitPrice field is included in both the ORDERLINE table and the ITEM table.

     (d)     Outline one potential issue that this may create when writing a query for
             data interrogation.                                                                             [2]

     The restaurant owner wants to introduce a loyalty scheme for customers. After 10 visits,
     they will receive a voucher for $ 20.

     (e)     Identify the steps to create a query to list the visits of a customer with the first name of
             “Akemi” and the surname of “Watene”. The query should display FirstName, Surname
             and OrderDate.                                                                                  [4]

(Option A continued)

2.   The restaurant owner has hired a database administrator to extend the database.

     The database administrator has decided to delete the LinePrice field from the
     ORDERLINE table.

                                               ORDERLINE

                      OrderID       ItemID       Quantity         UnitPrice   LinePrice

                      DM1007         F1234           1             16.99       16.99

                      DM1007        W2134            2               6.99      13.98



     (a)   Explain why the decision to delete the LinePrice field has been made.                      [3]

     The database administrator has created new tables to store employee data and create a
     work schedule.

     When an employee works a shift in the restaurant, their hours and pay rate are recorded
     by the shift manager as a database transaction.

     (b)   Define the term database transaction.[1]

     (c)   (i)	State one way to validate the hours_worked field.                                    [1]

           (ii)   Outline one way to verify the payrate field.                                        [2]

     The shift manager sometimes changes the employees’ work hours in the database during
     their shift. Employees can access the work hours and confirm their availability.

     (d)   Explain how data integrity can be maintained if an employee tries to access their work
           hours while the shift manager is editing them.                                             [4]

     The database administrator has set up a procedure for database recovery.

     One method of recovering a database is to use a transaction log.

     (e)   Describe one alternative method that could be used to recover a database after a
           crash has occurred.                                                                        [4]

3.   A European pet passport allows pets to travel between countries in the European Union. All pets
     have a microchip inserted that gives them a unique alphanumeric transponder code.

     The data contained in a pet passport is shown in Figure 1. All of the data is stored in a database.

     A pet owner may have more than one pet, and each pet has their own passport.
     Pet passports are issued by registered veterinary surgeons (vets).

     (a)   Construct the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that shows the relationship between
           pet owners, their pets, and the pet passport.                                                    [2]

     The data stored in the VET table can be represented in the following notation:

     VET(VetID, FirstName, Surname, Address, Postcode, City, Country, Phone, Email)

     The Phone field will be used as a secondary key.

     (b)   Define the term secondary key.                                                                   [1]

(Option A, question 3 continued)

     Each year, pets require vaccinations to prevent them from contracting rabies. Information about
     each vaccination can be seen in the pet passport (see Figure 2).

     The information in Figure 1 and Figure 2 needs to be normalized before being entered into
     the database.

     The VET table is given and will need to be incorporated into the final structure.

     (c)   Construct the database in 3rd Normal Form (3NF) for all of the entities shown in
           Figure 1 and Figure 2.

           You should use the same notation as that used in the representation of the VET table.      [8]

     Access to this database must comply with data protection legislation.

     (d)   Describe the principles of data protection legislation that would apply to a pet
           owner’s data.                                                                              [4]

Option B — Modelling and simulation

4.   Cattery5S is a cat adoption centre where potential cat owners are shown a series of cats
     one by one.

     The rules for choosing a cat are as follows:
     y The potential cat owner has five minutes to look at and interact with the cat.
     y The potential cat owner must either choose that cat or move to the next cat.
     y Once the potential owner has chosen a cat, they must adopt it and must not look at
       any more cats.
     y The potential cat owner can choose one cat only.

     If there are only two cats at the adoption centre, the potential cat owner must either choose
     the first cat or choose the second cat.

     (a)   State the probability of choosing the best cat from the two choices.                         [1]

     On one occasion, there are three cats at the adoption centre. The owner of Cattery5S realizes
     that the number of possible permutations of cat ratings increases significantly as the number
     of cats increases.

     Figure 3 shows the first three rows of a spreadsheet with the permutations of three cats
     based on a rating system. The permutations shown are the first three of the six that are
     possible. No two cats can have the same rating.
     y The cat rated 3 is the best choice.
     y The cat rated 1 is the worst choice.

     In row 1, the highest-rated cat is last in the series (column C). In row 2, the highest-rated cat
     is second (column B). This should continue until all possible permutations have been included.

                      Figure 3: The first three rows of a spreadsheet with the
                       permutations of three cats based on a rating system

     (b)   Copy and complete the spreadsheet model in Figure 3, showing the remaining
           permutations for the three cats rated 1 to 3.                                                [1]

(Option B continues on the following page)
                                                      –7–                                              8823 – 7015


(Option B, question 4 continued)

     When using the spreadsheet model in Figure 3, the following rules apply:
     y Never choose the first cat (column A).
     y Choose the second cat (column B) if it is rated higher than the first cat.
     y Choose the third cat (column C) if the second cat is rated lower than the first cat.

     Column D will show the rating of the chosen cat.

     For example, the value in cell D3 will be 3 because the rating in cell B3 (1) is lower than the
     rating in cell A3 (2) and the rating in cell C3 is greater than the rating in cell B3 (1).

     (c)   Construct a formula in cell D1 to show the rating of the chosen cat.                               [2]

     Cell D1 is copied and pasted into the rest of the rows in column D.

     A formula is used to count the number of times each of the three rated cats appear in
     column D. The formula will need to be used three times because there are three cats.

     (d)   (i)	Construct a formula to count the number of times each cat is chosen.                         [2]

           (ii)   Calculate the probability of choosing each of the three cats using this strategy.           [3]

                                   4

     When using the spreadsheet model in Figure 4.The following rules apply:
     y Never choose the first cat (column A).
     y Choose the second cat (column B) if it is rated higher than the first cat.
     y If not, compare the first cat with the third cat (column C) and choose the third cat if it is
       rated higher than the first cat.
     y If not, choose the fourth cat (column D).

     For example, if the order of ratings for cats A, B, C and D was 2, 1, 3, 4, you would choose
     the third cat (C) because 1 < 2 and 3 > 1.

     (e)   Construct a formula in cell E1 to show the rating of the chosen cat.                               [1]

5.   You are going to visit Cattery5S, where you will have the opportunity to see eight cats.

     You realize that the number of permutations for eight cats is 8! (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
     or 40 320.

     You need to create a function, FACTORIAL, that accepts the number of cats, N, and returns
     the factorial of that number.

     (a)   Construct an algorithm for the function FACTORIAL(N).[2]

     The following rules apply when there is an unknown number of cats at Cattery5S:
     y Never choose the first three cats.
     y Choose the fourth cat if it is rated higher than the best of the first three cats.
     y If not, compare the fifth cat with the highest-rated cat from the first three cats.
     y Choose the fifth cat if it is rated higher than the best of the first three cats.
     y If not, compare the next cat with the highest-rated cat from the first three cats.
     y Continue until you have chosen a cat or you have reached the last cat.
     y If you reach the last cat, you must choose it.

     You need to create a function, FINDHIGH, that accepts an array, ARR, that contains the
     ratings of eight cats and returns the highest value from the first three.

     For example, if ARR contained 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 8, 6, the value 3 would be returned.

     (b)   Construct an algorithm for the function FINDHIGH(ARR).[2]

     A NEXTPERMUTATION(ARR) function has been constructed that passes the last permutation
     and returns the next permutation.

     For example, if the first permutation order of ARR is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, the
     NEXTPERMUTATION(ARR) function would return an array ordered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7.
     Each call of the NEXTPERMUTATION(ARR) function would give the next permutation.
     So, the second call of the function would return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8.

     (c)   Construct an algorithm that uses the functions FACTORIAL(N), FINDHIGH(ARR) and
           NEXTPERMUTATION(ARR)to output the probability of choosing the best cat.                           [6]

     You are unsure if your strategy will give you the highest probability of finding the best cat.

     (d)   Outline one change you could make to the algorithm to test if it will produce the highest
           best-match probability.                                                                           [2]

     When you arrive at Cattery5S, you are informed that there are 20 cats to choose from. This is
     approximately 2.4 × 1018 permutations.

     (e)   Describe the hardware requirements needed by the algorithm when there are 20 cats.                [4]

6.   The police service, ambulance service, and fire service all use a central emergency
     management information system (EMIS). The EMIS can be used to create a 2D
     visualization of reported emergencies superimposed onto a map (see Figure 5).

                        Figure 5: 2D visualization of reported emergencies in

           (ii)   Outline the memory requirements for 2D visualization.                                [2]

     The emergency services have been notified of a fire in an office block. Several people are
     trapped inside and emergency service personnel will enter the building.

     A 3D visualization of the building will be rendered from the building’s floorplan. This 3D
     visualization will be electronically transferred to the smartphone/tablet with the emergency
     rescue team.

     (c)   Outline three considerations that need to be made before creating a 3D visualization of
           the building.                                                                               [6]

      Each monster begins the game with a number of health points, which are stated on the card,
      and leaves the game when it has no remaining health points. During a battle between two
      monsters, players take turns to roll the dice. The results determine how much each monster’s
      attack will reduce the defending monster’s health points.

11.   The Monster class contains the method attack(Monster defender). This is used when
      a monster attacks another monster (the defender).

      This method:
      y decreases the health variable of the defending monster by the amount returned by the
         rollDice method
      y uses the output method to display a defending monster’s name, damage and health
         points if its health variable is greater than zero
      y sets the defending monster’s health variable to zero if it is less than zero
      y outputs the defending monster’s name followed by “must leave the game” if its health
         variable is zero.

      (a)   Construct the method attack(Monster defender), using any existing static
            methods in the Monster class that might be useful.                                        [4]

      (b)   Outline two differences between the FireMonster class and an instance of
            FireMonster.[4]

      The programmer has created a class named Arena to model the place in which the
      monsters will battle.

      public class Arena {
          public Monster[] monsters = new Monster[10];
          int monsterCount = 0; //the number of monsters currently
          in array
          public void addMonster(Monster M) {
              // to be written
          }
          public void removeMonster(Monster M) {
              //to be written
          }
          public void doOneOnOneBattle(Monster A, Monster B) {
              while (A.health > 0 && B.health > 0) {
                   gameLog(A.attack(B));
                   gameLog(B.attack(A));
              }
              if (A.health > B.health) {
                   output(A.name + " WINS!");
                   removeMonster(B);
              } else if (B.health > A.health) {
                   output(B.name + " WINS!");
                   removeMonster(A);
              } else {
                   output("IT IS A DRAW!");
              }
          }
          public static void output(String message) {
              System.out.println(message);
          }
      }

(Option D, question 11 continued)

      (c)   Construct a simple UML class diagram showing the relationships between FireMonster,
            Monster and Arena. You do not need to include variables and methods.               [2]

      The method addMonster(Monster M) does the following:
      y If the monster array is not full and M is not in the array, it adds M to the array and
        increases the variable monsterCount.
      y Otherwise, a message is output stating the reason why.

      (d)   Construct the method addMonster(Monster M).[5]

      (e)   Outline two disadvantages of using object-oriented programming (OOP) in the
            development of software.                                                                     [4]


12.   (a)	Define the term polymorphism.[2]

      The method removeMonster(Monster M) in the Arena class removes Monster M from
      the array without leaving any gaps. It also updates the monsterCount variable. You may
      assume that Monster M already exists in the Arena.

      (b)   Construct the method removeMonster(Monster M)[6]

      Monsters have three special abilities that may be used on other monsters:
      y The ability “Heal”, which can be used on another monster
      y An ability specific to the monster type (eg, all water-type monsters have the ability
        “Put out fire”)
      y An ability specific to the monster (eg, only instances of Squishy have the ability “Clean”).

      The methods ability1(Monster defender), ability2(Monster defender) and
      ability3(Monster defender) will be created to enable the monsters to perform their
      abilities. A class for each individual monster card, eg “Squishy”, will be created.

      (c)   (i)	Define the term inheritance.[2]

            (ii)   Explain how inheritance and polymorphism could be used to maximize code
                   reuse in these three methods.                                                         [5]
