Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                    –4–                                        8823 – 6303M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.
                                                   –5–                                     8823 – 6303M


                                                 Section A
1.   (a)   State the trophic level of herring.                                                      [1]

           secondary consumer / third/3rd(trophic level);

     (b)   State the relationship between POPs concentration and the trophic level.                 [1]

           POP concentration increases/is higher moving up to higher/at increasing trophic
           levels / positive/direct correlation / as one increases the other increases;

           Note: Do not credit biomagnification or bioconcentration in response to this
           question.

     (c)   Explain the relationship between POPs concentration and trophic level.                   [2]

           a. POPs bioaccumulate/bioconcentrate within organisms/tissues, as they are
              taken up from surrounding environment/polluted ocean water/food;
           b. … because POPs are non-biodegradable/don’t break down…;
           c. …and result in biomagnification, as they pass from one trophic level to the next
              (across levels)...;
           d. ...due to the decrease of biomass/energy (respiratory losses) up the food chain;

           Note: Do not award marks if similar statements are given in 2(b) and 2(c)

     (d)   Calculate, as a percentage, the efficiency of energy transfer between herring and
           cod.                                                                                     [1]

           (5/25) x 100 = 20 (%);

     (e)   Outline one strength and one weakness of a pyramid of productivity as a model to
           represent energy in an ecosystem.                                                        [2]

           Strength: [1 max]
           a. shows the flow/production rate of energy/biomass through a food chain (rather
               than the standing stock) / never inverted;
           b. tracks change over time (rather than "snapshot" in time);
           c. more efficient comparison of different ecosystems;
           d. visual representation / simplification of complex system/ easy to communicate
               information to non-specialist;
           e. can be used to make predictions;

           Weakness: [1 max]
           f. difficult to place organisms that occupy more than one trophic level;
           g. hard to get accurate data because collection is difficult / inevitably some values
              are approximate;
           h. (estimating in field) may involve killing of organisms;
           i. oversimplification and loss of detail/complexities of interacting factors
                                                   –6–                                         8823 – 6303M


2.   (a)   Identify the region that shows the greatest NOx emission reductions in February
           2020 as shown in Figure 2(a).                                                                [1]

           Asia and Middle East;

     (b)   Outline one reason for the NOx emission reductions during Covid-19 lockdowns, as
           shown in Figure 2(a).                                                                        [1]

           reduced burning/combustion of fossil fuels, a source of NOx / due to reduced
           traffic/factory closures;

     (c)   Explain the relationship between the NOx emissions shown in Figure 2(a) and
           tropospheric ozone concentrations shown in Figure 2(b).                                      [2]

           a. the two have a positive correlation/as NOx decreases so does tropospheric ozone;
           b. …because NOx (is a primary pollutant) that can lead to tropospheric ozone
              (secondary pollutant);
           c. …because NOx interacts with sunlight/UV (and sometimes VOCs) to produce
              tropospheric ozone;
           d. tropospheric ozone reductions continue to increase in some regions after NOx
              reductions level off / possibly because other factors (e.g. weather, other
              pollutants) influence tropospheric ozone production;

     (d)   Outline two impacts of tropospheric ozone on living systems.                                 [2]

           a. damages the leaves of plants / the ability of plants to photosynthesize / reduces
              agricultural/primary productivity;
           b. reduced PP/global warming may cause loss of habitats/food for animals;
           c. damages lung tissue / causes respiratory diseases / lung inflammation
           d. eye irritation;

           Note: Do NOT credit "global/local warming" unless explicitly linked to other impacts
           in living systems, as in MPb. Do NOT credit impacts that are due to increased
           UV/solar radiation (e.g. cataracts).

     (e)   Tropospheric ozone is a major component of photochemical smog. Outline two
           conditions that contribute to high levels of photochemical smog in an area.                  [2]

           a. topographic conditions: next to mountains / in a depression/low-lying area traps
              pollution;
           b. climatic conditions: high pressure systems / weak winds / temperature
              inversions / high insolation / limited rainfall / high temperature;
           c. high population urban density: heavy use of fossil fuels due to high vehicle
              use/industrial output / evaporation of paint and cleaning (VOC- releasing)
              products;
           d. burning of forests increases the formation of primary pollutants that contribute to
              smog;

     (f)   NOx also contributes to acid deposition. State one method that could be used to
           restore an ecosystem damaged by acid deposition.                                             [1]

           liming / reforestation / restocking fish / extracting toxic metals from water/soils /
           adding nutrients/fertilisers to soils / adding wood ash / planting acid resistant plants
           to bind soil;
                                                 –7–                                         8823 – 6303M


3.   (a)   With reference to Figure 3, identify the stage that represents the greatest food loss
           and waste in North America.                                                                [1]

           use / stage 5;

     (b)   Outline two strategies to reduce food waste at the use stage (stage 5) in North
           America.                                                                                   [2]

            a. buy only food that will be consumed;
            b. pay attention to expiry dates of purchased food;
            c. ensure proper storage conditions (at home) to reduce spoilage / avoid pest
               infestation;
            d. buy/consume “ugly”/misshaped fruits and vegetables;
            e. donate unsold/unused food;
            f. some food items may be re-cooked / put in freezer (for later consumption);
            g. education/ awareness campaign to reduce wasteful attitudes related to food
               consumption;

           Note: Accept other valid points relevant to use of food; do NOT credit “composting” or
           any SDW disposal method


     (c)   With reference to a stage in Figure 3, describe one reason for a difference
           between food loss and waste in a less economically developed country (LEDC).               [2]

           LEDCs might have more waste in stage 1/2/3/4/5…; [1max]
           …due to… [1max]
           a. …more pest infestation due to lack of pesticides (stage 1);
           b. …poor storing conditions/ higher ambient temperatures increasing spoilage
              during handling/transportation (stage 2 or 4);
           c. ...less efficient facilities/machinery may lead to increased waste during
              harvest/handling/packaging (stage 2 or 3);

           LEDCs might have less waste in stage 1/2/3/4/5…; [1max]
           …due to… [1max]
            d. …subsistence farming reduced productivity (stage 1);
            e. …local consumption of grown food reducing need for handling and
               processing (stages 2 or 3);
            f. …buying/eating the cheaper “ugly” food (stages 4 or 5);
            g. …consuming less food due to less income (stages 4 or 5);
            h. ...consuming lower on food chain/less meat (stages 4 or 5);

           Note: Accept any point of equal significance
           Only award credit for reasons that are correctly linked with “less” or “more” waste.
                                             –8–                                         8823 – 6303M


(d)   Discuss the sustainability of two solid domestic waste disposal strategies that can
      be used to manage food waste.                                                               [4]

      a.   Composting is turning food waste into natural fertilizer / reduces waste to landfill
           / emits less methane (aerobic composting)…;
      b.   …but does not apply to meat/dairy/liquids / may associate with pests/disease;
      c.   Methane collection from landfills would contribute to sustainable/low-impact
           energy production / sustainably designed landfills (e.g. liner, collecting &
           treating leachate) is an efficient method of dealing with huge amounts of
           waste…;
      d.   …but landfills are notorious for emitting various pollutants contaminating
           ground/water/air / prevent any possibility of re-using food waste / require large
           amount of land;
      e.   Incineration would efficiently reduce volume of food waste / require less land…;
      f.   …but would release harmful air pollutants / would require a lot of energy/initial
           investment;
      g.   anaerobic digestion/fermentation may turn food waste into biogas/fuel...;
      h.   ...but requires facilities (digesters)/expertise not available in LEDCs;

       Allow [1 max] for a conclusion, like “landfill/incineration overall increase EF /
      composting overall contributes to lower EF” or comparing the sustainability of the
      SDWs discussed “compost is a less expensive SDW than incineration / compost is
      less efficient for management of large quantities of food waste”

      Award [2 max] for each SDW strategy (i.e. one mark for positive, one for negative)

      Note: only award mark once for same point for different strategies
      Note: recycling is not a valid method
                                                –9–                                       8823 – 6303M


                                             Section B
4.   (a)   Outline how the ecological footprint (EF) of a country can be measured.                 [4]

           a. EF is the area of land and water required to sustainably provide all resources at
              the rate at which they are being consumed by a given population;
           b. find total amount of waste produced from food production/domestic activities;
           c. find the total amount of food consumed;
           d. find the total amount of water consumed by the population;
           e. find the total amount of energy consumed / carbon (dioxide) emissions;
           f. find the mean rate of productivity of local vegetation;
           g. find the total availability of local water supply;
           h. calculate the area of local vegetation/land required to absorb all waste and
              produce all food / (annual) total consumption rate plus waste emission rate
              divided by (annual) land productivity;
           i. (If per capita rates are initially measured then) multiply per capita EF with
              population size;
                                            – 10 –                                     8823 – 6303M



(b)   With reference to an aquatic food-production system, explain how renewable natural
      capital can be sustainably managed.                                                       [7]

      a. sustainable resource management prevents resource/natural capital depletion...
         / allows full recovery of ecosystems affected by extraction and use of
         resources... / ...so that the future generations can also benefit from it;
      b. renewable natural capital can be generated and/or replaced as fast as it is being
         used / includes living species/e.g. fish and ecosystems that use solar energy
         and photosynthesis;
      c. estimate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of fish/marine animal population;
      d. avoid overfishing/tragedy of commons / catch restricted to less or equal to MSY;
      e. international/national policies/coordination dictating use of quotas/MSY;
      f. reduce by-catch;
      g. implement sustainable fishing methods (e.g. spearfishing, satellite detection of
         boats and fish stocks, not fishing a single fish species) / avoid non-sustainable
         fishing methods (e.g. longlining, bottom trawling);
      h. international regulation of fishing grounds / designation of exclusion areas
         (MPAs);
      i. avoid catch of younger fish / increase mesh size of nets / ban fishing in breeding
         season;
      j. education on sustainability principles for fishermen/aquaculturists;
      k. stricter monitoring/fining of illegal fishing;
      l. legal framework requiring sustainability certification of marine products sold /
         social responsibility of enterprises involved in fisheries and aquaculture;
      m. polyculture approach in aquaculture / feces fed to algae used as fish food;
      n. applying sustainable closed-system technologies (in aquaculture) / e.g.
         recirculating tanks/flow-through systems/inland ponds/raceways / power by
         renewable energy;
      o. reduced stock density in aquaculture (prevents disease spreading);
      p. reduced use of antibiotics/pesticides/fertilizers to reduce pollution/contamination
         of nearby habitat/indigenous species;
      q. encourage/fund scientific research on growth rate/productivity/survival/health of
         fish species raised in captivity;
      r. treat aquaculture effluent with bioremediation/absorbing materials/settling
         ponds/use vegetation as filters;
      s. optimize feed composition to reduce food waste / use of probiotics to reduce
         phosphorus load in fish excrement;

 Accept points of equal significance relating to other renewable natural capital, e.g. algae
 cultivation, river/lake ecosystems, wetlands, estuaries.
                                                – 11 –                                 8823 – 6303M




(c)   Human population dynamics are influenced more by social, cultural, political and

      Discuss the validity of this statement.                                                   [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
      markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with ‘understanding

      Answers may include:

      •   understanding concepts and terminology of population dynamics; carrying
          capacity; ecological footprint; limits to growth; Malthus v Boserup; population
          policies; pro-natal & anti-natal; contraception; tax incentives; abortion policies;
          marital age; female emancipation; literacy; religions/ideologies; migrations;
          wars; child labour; importation of resources; density dependent factors; resource
          exploitation; sustainable yields; demographic transition; renewability of
          resources; recycling; etc
      •   breadth in addressing and linking population dynamics (growth and decline)
          with a wide range of factors including social (e.g. role of women), cultural (e.g.
          religious imperatives), political (e.g. population policies), economic (e.g. tax
          incentives), resource availability (e.g. food production, energy, water, pollution
          management) etc
      •   examples of named social, cultural, political, economic factors that influence
          population growth in a range of different named countries and societies (MEDCs
          and LEDCs, Western and Eastern, tropical and temperate) along with examples
          of different resources that may limit population growth, and different
          management strategies addressing the availability of resources.
      •   balanced analysis of the extent to which sociopolitical factors are more or less
          influential than resource availability on the growth and/or decline of human
          populations considering both the pros and cons for the argument selected.
      •   a conclusion that is consistent with and supported by analysis and
          examples given, e.g. Human populations in the latter stages of demographic
          transition are largely regulated by sociopolitical factors and generally it is only
          the populations at earlier stages of the DTM that are literally limited by resource
          factors such as famine and water scarcity.

5.   (a)   Outline the differences between anthropocentric and ecocentric value systems.             [4]

            Anthropocentrism [2 max]
            a. sustainable management is a duty of human societies / environmental
               manager;
            b. population control given equal weight to resource use;
            c. strong legal regulation by authorities / imposing environmental taxes, fees,
               compensations;
            d. it is moral for human societies to benefit from natural capital;

            Ecocentrism [2 max]
            e. nature/ecosystems should be left alone with minimal interference / deep
               ecologist;
            f. self-reliant communities (population controlled by carrying capacity) / use of
               small-scale technology;
            g. self-imposed constraint in resource use;
            h. holistic world view / spiritual dimensions to natural systems/intrinsic value /
               prioritizes bio-rights;

(b)   Evaluate the use of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to ensure the
      sustainability of a new development project.                                               [7]

      Definition [1 max]

      sustainability is the use and management of resources that allows full natural
      replacement of the resources exploited / full recovery of the ecosystems affected by
      their extraction and use / so that future generations may also use them;

      Pros [4 max]

      a. EIA provides to decision-makers the relevant information on the current situation
         (baseline study);
      b. identifies/predicts the possible environmental impact before the onset of a
         project;
      c. suggests the possible management strategies that would mitigate/prevent any
         adverse effects of a project;
      d. holds policy-makers/entrepreneurs accountable for any decision they will
         eventually make (in follow-up assessment);
      e. takes into consideration social and economic impacts as well/e.g. social
         acceptance, deterioration of property value/life quality;
      f. may be effective in stopping a potentially harmful project;

      Cons [4 max]

      g. may not prevent the implementation of a project, even if it has severe negative
         impacts;
      h. requires technical expertise that might not be available in all countries/situations;
      i. if funded by the enterprise developing the project, it might be biased;
      j. in most countries, the legal/regulatory framework is not well established / lack of
         standards/official training for practitioners;
      k. some environmental factors/impacts may not be readily quantified / e.g.
         life/landscape quality / may fail to properly study some environmental factors;
      l. may not include socio-economic impacts;
      m. it may be more profitable for an enterprise to pay a fine for ignoring EIA’s
         precautions;
      n. may delay the implementation of a project due to time consuming procedure.

      Conclusion [1 max]

      Despite the shortcomings of an EIA, becoming a legal requirement for major
      projects has reduced the adverse environmental impacts/resulted in higher social
      responsibility of enterprises / Even a “perfectly” implemented EIA may not
      guarantee the future sustainability of a project, as environmental conditions may
      change (e.g. climate change).

(c)   Urbanization has had a greater effect on the quality and availability of freshwater resources
      than agricultural activities.
      Discuss the validity of this statement.                                                     [9]

      The following guide for using the mark bands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
      markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with ‘understanding
      concepts’) This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
      deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:

      •   understanding concepts and terminology of urbanization, waste-water
          treatment; leaching of heavy metals; sedimentation; suspended solids;
          landscape changes; well-drilling; aquifers; urban growth; grey water cycling; acid
          precipitation; reverse osmosis; pesticide pollution; bioaccumulation;
          biomagnification; irrigation; flooding; drip irrigation; leaching of fertilisers;
          eutrophication;
      •   breadth in addressing and linking urbanisation and agricultural activities with
          a range of associated impacts on quality and availability of freshwater including
          pollution; waste disposal; sustainable management; overexploitation;
          development of irrigation/drinking systems/dams etc
      •   examples of named pollutants from urban and agricultural sources; named
          strategies for sustainable management of water in urban and agricultural
          contexts; named countries/societies in which issues arise;
      •   balanced analysis evaluating the relative impact (negative or positive) of both
          urbanisation and agriculture on water quality and availability and the extent to
          which these may be mitigated through sustainable management
      •   a conclusion that is consistent with and supported by analysis and
          examples given, e.g. although urbanization creates a broader range of
          negative effects on freshwater quality than agriculture it also provides methods
          for the production of freshwater from sewage and sea water.

6.   (a)   Outline how species diversity in an ecosystem can be measured.                           [4]

           a. species diversity in communities is a product of two variables: the number of
              species (richness) and their relative proportions (evenness);
           b. name an appropriate index, e.g. Simpson’s diversity index / Shannon’s index;

           To calculate Simpson's Index:
           c. the area must be sampled, e.g. using quadrats placed randomly or
               systematically/pitfall trap/mark–recapture;
           d. several samples need to be taken and the data pooled (to give a better estimate
               of overall diversity);
           e. the number of individuals of each species (abundance) should be noted in each
               sampling plot;
           f. there is no necessity to be able to identify all the species, (provided they can be
               distinguished from each other);




           g. calculate diversity index by using a valid formula, like
             n = the total number of organisms of a particular species
             N = the total number of organisms of all species
             [Note: credit only if all symbols are explained; accept different formulas as found
             in literature]
           h. with this index, the higher the value of D, the higher the species diversity;

           Note: Accept any other relevant measurement to those given.
                Do NOT credit Lincoln's index formula.

(b)   Explain how the movement of tectonic plates has influenced biodiversity and
      evolution.                                                                                   [7]

      a. plate tectonic movement may lead to divergence of continents/growth of
         mountain ranges/opening of oceans/formation of islands…;
      b. …which separates populations/species from each other / isolates gene pools…;
      c. …leading to divergent evolution/action of natural selection/genetic drift /
         accumulating different mutations over (geological) time…;
      d. …as they have to adapt to different habitats/climates/environmental pressures
         (in order for fitter species to survive)…
      e. ...causing speciation (thus, increasing biodiversity);
      f. ...or may shift population in harsher climatic/habitat conditions, causing their
         extinction (thus reducing biodiversity);
      g. plate tectonic movement may lead to formation of land bridges / closing of
         oceans…;
      h. …which brings different populations/species in contact / opens novel migration
         routes…;
      i. …leading to interspecific competition / competitive niche exclusion…;
      j. …which might cause the extinction of less fit species (reducing biodiversity);
      k. …also leading to hybridization/interbreeding of related species / increased gene
         exchange/flow…;
      l. …which may either reduce genetic differences / lump related species (thus,
         reducing biodiversity);
      m. …or create a new species better adapted to intermediate/new habitat / e.g.
         introgression in plants (thus, increasing biodiversity);

      Note: Do NOT credit description of evolutionary process (mutations / natural
           selection / survival of fittest / fitter genes dominating a population / speciation)
           outside the context of plate tectonics movement.

(c)   Discuss the effectiveness of habitat-based conservation in relation to the impacts of
      climate change.                                                                          [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be offered in
      responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the markbands (although
      ESS terminology has been conflated with ‘understanding concepts’) This guide simply
      provides some possible inclusions and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It
      outlines the kind of elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the
      specific mark within that band.
      Answers may include:
      •   understanding concepts and terminology of habitat-based conservation;
          species-based conservation; reserves; national parks; size; shape; edge effects;
          corridors; buffer zones; ecotourism; climate change; precipitation patterns;
          global warming; biome shifts; migrations; extinctions; salinity change; melting
          glaciers; hazardous weather events; droughts; rising sea levels; salt intrusion
          etc
      •   breadth in addressing and linking a good range of features of habitat-based
          conservation including design and management of reserves and their relevance
          in addressing a range of impacts from climate change including those leading to
          loss of biodiversity and changing distribution patterns.
      •   examples of named conservation areas from a variety of named
          regions/countries and examples of named species impacted by climate change
          along with relevant named organisations currently addressing habitat
          conservation (e.g. World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Greenpeace, Friends of the
          Earth International and Earth First!)
      •   balanced analysis evaluating the degree to which the various aspects of
          conservation areas can or cannot effectively address the threats of climate
          change including both strengths and limitations of habitat-based conservation.
      •   A conclusion that is consistent with and supported by analysis and
          examples given, e.g. habitat-based conservation strategies are effective,
          especially when contrasted to species approach, but cannot compensate for
          climate change impacts on their own; there needs to be international
          cooperation and political will toward mitigating climate change altogether.

7.   (a)   Outline four characteristics of a highly productive soil.                                [4]

           a. presence of sufficient basic nutrients (minerals) / e.g. nitrates, phosphates,
              potassium;
           b. contains adequate organic/humus content to retain moisture/good water-
              holding/infiltration capacity;
           c. pH is optimal for plants grown (usually 5.5 to 7.0);
           d. loamy soil/ balanced clay, silt, sand composition…;
           e. …leading to optimal soil properties: balanced drainage/infiltration/permeability /
              adequate porosity/protection from water-logging;
           f. thick topsoil / deep soil layers provide higher water/nutrient holding ability /
              better plant support / less water-logging;
           g. rich microbiota/decomposing microorganisms/nitrogen-fixing bacteria (including
              symbiotic Rhizobia)/mycorrhizal fungi / high decomposing activity / high
              biological mixing;
           h. absence of toxic substances;
           i. presence of adequate secondary nutrients (minerals) / e.g. sulphates,
              magnesium/calcium/iron/copper salts;

           Note: Do NOT credit soil colour

(b)   Compare and contrast the movement of energy and matter within an ecosystem.               [7]

      Similarities (“Compare”) [4 max]:
      a. both move/flow between/across (biotic and/or abiotic) storages/compartments /
         e.g heat loss from an organism’s body and biomass moving up the food chain /
         solar energy heating the oceans and nutrient intake by a plant;
      b. both move/flow within (biotic and/or abiotic) storages/compartments / e.g. water
         moving from roots to leaves (within plant storage) / light passing through the
         atmosphere;
      c. Both transfers may occur simultaneously/ e.g. river flow, wind advection,
         chemical energy in ingested biomass/decomposed feces;
      d. both may be transformed during their movement (transfer) / e.g. solar energy
         heats the atmosphere and plant biomass becomes animal biomass up the food
         chain;
      e. both follow the First Law of Thermodynamics / neither energy nor matter may be
         destroyed or created / both are conserved during their movement;
      f. both follow the Second Law of Thermodynamics / any process involving either
         energy or matter movement will lead to increase in the total entropy (disorder) of
         the system / energy “lost” as heat and materials disintegrate;
      g. both are important ecosystem inputs / organisms would die/ecosystems would
         collapse without either energy or material input;
      h. both may leave ecosystems as outputs / e.g. heat loss and migration/leaching;

      Differences (“Contrast”) [4 max]:
      i. there’s continuous influx/input of solar energy in Ecosphere /ecosystems…
      j. …whereas matter inflow is virtually zero in ecosphere (as Earth is a closed
          system) / very limited in open (eco)systems;
      k. there's continuous heat loss/radiation from ecosystems/Ecosphere /energy
          output is also the reflection of light/albedo... ;
      l. ...whereas loss of matter from ecosystems is relatively insignificant / e.g. in the
          form of immigration/leaching / matter output is virtually zero in ecosphere (as
          Earth is a closed system);
      m. matter is mostly cycled (i.e. biogeochemical cycles) within the ecosphere…;
      n. … whereas energy follows a uni-directional (and irreversible) movement: solar
          to chemical to heat / moves mostly as chemical energy within ecosystems / also
          stored as thermal energy inside bodies (living or inanimate);

      Note: Allow credit for points of equal significance and validity if response
          compares and contrasts valid examples of movements, e.g. solar
          radiation/heat loss vs. precipitation/wind.
          No need to explicitly mention whether KS refers to similarity or difference.
          Do NOT credit that matter is tangible, whereas energy is intangible, as this is
          a property of their nature not their movement.

      Answers may include:

      •   understanding concepts and terminology of food production systems;
