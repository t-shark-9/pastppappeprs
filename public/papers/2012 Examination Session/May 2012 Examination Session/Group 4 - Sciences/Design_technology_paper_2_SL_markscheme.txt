1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin. For Section A this should be against each mark allocation
      shown in square brackets e.g. [2]. The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for
      the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question
      part in the body of the script to transfer these marks to that question part in the script.

9.    Section A: Add together the total for each question and write it in the Examiner column on the
      cover sheet.
      Section B: Insert the total for each question in the Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:       Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
      Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made
      an error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts
      are checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details:                            Design Technology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 20 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 40 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalise candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

                   marketplace and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                   percentile ranges vary in different regions of the world / human dimensions
                   vary in different regions;
                   different sizes need to be produced for different market sectors;                 [2]

           (iii)   Award [1] for one reason why plastic bottles are suitable for recycling and
                   [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                   they are made from a thermoplastic material;
                   the molecular structure of thermoplastic materials means the polymer chains
                   can be rearranged on heating;                                                     [2]

           (ii)    Award [1] for each point in a comparison of stitching with gluing for
                   joining shoe parts in relation to product life cycle [3 max].
                   stitching is usually stronger than gluing;
                   stitched parts are easier to replace when worn out;
                   the shoes will last longer / extending the product life cycle;
                   stitching is more environmentally friendly as gluing may use toxins;
                   stitching is a more complex process than gluing/takes longer/costs more;          [3]

     (c)   (i)     Award [1] for one way in which design for manufacture (DfM) has been a
                   dominating constraint on the design brief for the Terra Plana shoe and [1]
                   for a brief explanation [2 max].
                   design for materials / design for process;
                   materials / manufacturing techniques have been chosen as a prime objective

(ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of the
       concepts of reuse, repair and recycling in relation to the Terra Plana
       shoes [3 max] per concept.
       Reuse:
       the shoes are part of the fashion market;
       people do not always wear out their shoes;
       part worn shoes can be reused by others / given to charities;

       Repair:
       the shoes are designed to support repair;
       by worn out parts being easily replaced;
       due to the lack of glue / use of stitching;

       Recycle:
       the shoes are manufactured from recycled materials;
       when obsolete, the shoes themselves can be recycled;
       due to the materials chosen / manufacturing technique;                       [9]

       Innovator:
       the scooter is limited in innovation;
       as it is in the early stage of diffusion;

       Entrepreneur:
       South is an entrepreneur;
       as he was looking for a business opportunity / to make money;
       focused on an idea which was good enough to raise funds to develop

           (ii)    Award [1] for each of three distinct points in a discussion of the
                   contribution of craft production and mechanisation for the manufacture of
                   the bureau [3 max].
                   some wood working machines will be used in the production, suitable for
                   cutting / abrading / joining;
                   the bureau also requires hand-craftsmanship in order for the decorative
                   pattern of (inlaid) veneers to be created;
                   and the skilled assembly / surface finish;                                       [3]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for a reason for the high cost of the bureau and [1] for a brief
             explanation [2 max].
             amount of skill required from craftsmen;
             resulting in high labour costs;

             small scale production of a unique design;
             requiring the expertise and time of an innovative designer which
             is expensive;                                                                     [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of each of
             three ways in which the designer has attempted to balance form with
             function in the design of the bureau [3 max] per way.
             when closed the bureau has strong visual appeal;
             the decoration will stand out in a room;
             though the function as a writing bureau is not obvious;

             the bureau is multi-functional;
             it can be used for storage and as a stand alone piece of furniture for
             displaying other objects;
             while the form provides stability;

             when open the function dictates the form;
             the bureau loses its striking appearance;
             the colour of the inside does not match the outside;

             the pattern of the decorative veneers;
             is carefully designed so that the pattern for the ends balance with each other;
             even when the bureau is open and the pattern on the outside of the central
             part is not visible;

             the straight lines used for the decorative veneers;
             are compatible with the rectangular geometry of the rest of the form;
             and enhance the function as a stand alone display bureau;

             the design of the surface decoration;
             is like having an abstract painting in the room;
             the shape of the rest of the bureau supports the contemporary style;              [9 max]
