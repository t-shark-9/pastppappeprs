Subject Details: Astronomy SL Paper 1 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions.
Maximum total = [30 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Significant figures are only penalized where noted.

11.   EOR : Evidence Of Rule : normally associated with a methodology used.

12.   ORA : Or Reverse Argument.

The Stars

1.   as you move towards the edge/limb, the light is coming from material with a lower
     average temperature / from material through the whole depth of the photosphere;

     The answer should reference the “depth” into the Sun or that the light is emitted from
     material with a higher (average) temperature.
