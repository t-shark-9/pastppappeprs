Subject Details: Astronomy SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [40 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Significant figures are only penalized where noted.

11.   EOR : Evidence Of Rule : normally associated with a methodology used.

12.   ORA : Or Reverse Argument.

           Award [2] for the correct answer, given to 2 significant figures.
           The second mark is not given for an answer of 2.3 × 10 32 – in this case, the
           candidate may have written the equation down and substituted correctly,
           but has not shown that they have actually carried out the calculation.

     (d)   If n is increased from 1× 109 m −3 to 1×1013 m −3 , then MJ decreases to
           2.3(11) ×1030 kg . With MJ now less than MTotal, the cloud is likely to contract.

           Award [1 max] for any reasonable answer.
           If the students states a probe or observatory of some kind (e.g., SOHO, Hinode
           spacecraft), then a check is needed to ensure it is in orbit around the Earth rather
           than (like SOHO and Hinode) in a solar orbit near the Earth.

     (b)   material thrown out from the Earth;
           gravitationally caught (by the Earth) / went into orbit (around the Earth);                   [2]

     (c)   the far side of the Moon is more cratered/is saturated with craters / ORA;

           Plus any one of the following: [1 max]
           it is not (partially) shielded by the presence of the Earth / OWTTE / ORA;
           the mare/seas have covered the surface/craters on the near side / OWTTE / ORA;
           the crust on the near side is thinner than the far side / OWTTE / ORA;                  [2 max]

     (d)   the moon spins;
           with a period equal to the time for one orbit around the Earth;                               [2]
           Award [2] for “The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth”. The answer “The
           Moon’s orbit is synchronous” does not have enough detail to be credit worthy.

           the order of the objects is Sun – Earth – Moon; (accept reverse order)                        [1]
           The Sun’s rays are NOT required – only the relative positions.

     (f)   light refracts through the atmosphere of the Earth;
           red light is less scattered by the atmosphere, hence the Moon looks red / OWTTE;              [2]
           The first mark only, can be given for “Light diffracts around the Earth”.

     (b)   the presence of high mass/OB-type/very bright stars;
           triggered by spiral density waves;                                                           [2]

     (c)   the disc is where all the gas is;
           gas is required to form stars / stars form by the contraction of gas (clouds) / OWTTE;       [2]
           Accept the reverse argument with reference to the Halo/Bulge.

     (d)   the bright stars (forming the spiral arms) die quickly/are short lived;
           new star growth is triggered (to replace the stars that have died quickly) …;

           spiral density waves rotate around/through the disc/galaxy …;
           … with a (rotational) speed slightly different to the galaxy;                            [2 max]

     (e)   red-shift means that the (relative) motion is away from us;
           if the galaxy were expanding, all stars would be red-shifted;
           stars “behind us and further out” are travelling slower than us (around the galactic
           centre) / ORA;
           our relative motion is away from them;                                                   [2 max]

4.   (a)   the age of the universe = 13.8 ×109 years
           therefore, age of the universe = 13.8 × 109 × (365.25 × 24 × 60 × 60) = 4.35(49) ×1017 s

     (f)   6 × 10−27 kg m −3 is less than the critical density of 1× 10−26 kg m −3 and so, this
           would suggest that the universe will expand forever

           50.0 m ;                                                                                 [1]
           1.2 × 104 ms −1 /1.25 ×104 ms −1 /1.247 ×104 ms −1 ;                                     [2]
           The second conversion has two marks, for each of the two conversions. As such,
           one mark can be given for …

           27 900 × 1609
           27 900
            3600
           1609
                 This final option would be the correct two conversions, but a mistake has
           3600
           been made in the calculation.

     (b)   Escape velocity: the speed needed for an object to be able to leave the surface of
                             a planet and just escape the gravitational influence / OWTTE;
           Asteroid:         a small object in orbit around the Sun;                                [2]
           The second marking point does require the fact that the object is small(er than
           a planet) and also, that it is in orbit around the Sun.

     (c)   no;
           because it is presently moving away from the Earth;                                      [2]
           For the second marking point, do not allow “because it is closer to Mars” /
           “because it is being pulled towards Mars”.

     (d)   Location of the Impact: north of the rover;                                              [1]

           Reasons:
           cheaper than sending a man to Mars;
           safer than sending a man to Mars;
           to look for signs of life;
           to look for water / look for signs of (active) volcanism;
           to analyse the mineral structure of the surface / look for iron containing
           compounds;
           assess whether the atmosphere is conducive to life;                                  [2 max]
           Allow any reasonable comments for the last two marks.

      Award [2] for correct answer given to 2 significant figures.                      Answers with
      anything other than 2 significant figures are penalized.

(f)   it would make the escape velocity greater;
      because there would be a loss of (kinetic) energy (as the object moves
      upwards/away);                                                                                       [2]

(g)   the radius of the asteroid is 25.0 m
           M                       4π      4π
       D=       M = DV = D × r 3 = 5000 × × 25.03 = 3.27 × 108 kg
            V                       3       3

      radius = 25.0 m ;
      3.27 ×108 kg ;                                                                                       [2]
      If the candidate uses the diameter of the asteroid, they have a mass of
       2.62 × 10 9 kg . This is worth [1 max]. If the answer is written to anything other
      than 3 significant figures, then the candidate loses [1 max], to a minimum of [0].

(h)   vimpact = v present + vescape = 1.25 × 104 + 5.0 × 103 = 1.75 × 104 ms −1 = 1.8 ×104 ms −1
      The lower value of 1.34 × 104 ms −1 , is probably due to the effect of air resistance.

      1.75 ×104 ms −1 /1.8 ×104 ms −1 ;
      air resistance;                                                                                      [2]

(i)   the asteroid is less likely to burn up in the atmosphere;                                            [1]
      The students needs to give more detail than simply, “the atmosphere would have
      less effect”. The students must state a reason which gives some effect on the
      asteroid.

(j)   a month is not a long time to measure its path;
      its path has a very small curvature so uncertainties are large;
      it is very difficult to precisely model paths that are very elliptical;
      it is difficult to follow a precise path for such a small object;                                [1 max]
      Allow any reasonable argument.
