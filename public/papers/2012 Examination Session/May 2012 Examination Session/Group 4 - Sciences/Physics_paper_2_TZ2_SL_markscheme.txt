General Marking Instructions

   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
   or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
   the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
   they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
   through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking.
   For any queries regarding the use of Scoris™, please contact emarking@ibo.org.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where
     it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
     mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark.
     In these cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to
     write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for
     these additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to
     the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
     part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an
     answer to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the
     part question, enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or
     section of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in
     line with the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that
     you stamp “seen” on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should
     not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect
     using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [25 marks]. Maximum total=[50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded when marking. Indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.
