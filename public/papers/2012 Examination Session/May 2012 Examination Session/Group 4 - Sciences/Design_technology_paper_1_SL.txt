2.    Ron Hickman – a do-it-yourself enthusiast – damaged a chair he was using to support a piece
      of wood he was sawing. This gave him an idea for a work bench which became the Workmate
      (Figure 1).

5.    The QWERTY typewriter keyboard (Figure 2) was designed by Christopher Latham Sholes
      around 1870 to speed up typing and is now the most widely-used keyboard layout on most
      English-language computers (Figure 3).

      Why did the QWERTY keyboard become the dominant design for English-language computer
      keyboards?

             I.     It reduced the cost of retraining.
             II.    The mechanical keys do not jam.
             III.   It helped the transition from typewriter to computer.

8.    Flybe is one of Europe’s biggest regional airlines.  In June 2007 Flybe pioneered the development
      of an eco-labelling scheme for aircraft (Figure 5).  The label was modelled on those used for the
      sale of household appliances and shows a range of environmental indicators for particular aircraft.  
      Flybe has published its methodology so that it can be used by other airlines.

21.   Before Henry Ford applied assembly-line production to the development of a simple and reliable car
      only very rich people could afford them.  Henry Ford’s design for a Model T Ford (Figure 11) was
      based on assembly-line production, which meant that the mass produced car was affordable for a
      mass market and revolutionized American society.

24.   Figure 13 and Figure 14 show a roadable aircraft called Transition®.  It is classified by aviation
      authorities as a light sport aircraft.   Its wings fold at the touch of a button to convert into a car.  
      Roadable aircraft have to meet motor vehicle regulations and aviation regulations.  This results in
      conflicts which the designer must resolve.

Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Tupperware is a product family of food containers (Figure 15) with a unique seal modelled on a
paint tin lid (Figure 16).   Tupperware was developed by Earl Tupper who worked for the plastics
division of chemical manufacturing giant DuPont.   The first plastics were brittle with an unpleasant
odour (smell).   Tupper developed an odour-free flexible plastic.   His polyethene food cartons were
first sold in 1945.   Tupperware was difficult to re-seal as air had to be released when putting the
lid on.  It was not successful until Brownie Wise sold Tupperware through a network of housewives who
hosted parties and were able to demonstrate how to re-seal the containers to customers.
