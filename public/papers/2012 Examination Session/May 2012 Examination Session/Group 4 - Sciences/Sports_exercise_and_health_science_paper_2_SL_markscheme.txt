General Marking Instructions

   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) by e-mail (or
   telephone) – if by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded the markscheme
   from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries they have
   regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader by
   e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries during the marking process.

Note:
The DHL courier service must be used to send assessment material to your team leader/senior moderator
and the IB Assessment Centre. (However, this service is not available in every country.) The cost is met
directly by the IB. It is vitally important that the correct DHL account number is used.

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
      awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin. For Section A this should be against each mark allocation
      shown in square brackets e.g. [2]. The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for
      the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the
      end of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and a
      note made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question
      part in the body of the script.

9.    Section A: Add together the total for each question and write it in the Examiner column on the
                 cover sheet.
      Section B: Insert the total for each question in the Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:     Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
                 column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made an
      error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
      correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect in the left-
      hand margin.

Subject Details: Sports, Exercise and Health Science SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in Section
B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   the volume of air inspired or expired (per breath)                                        [1]

     (b)   (157.5 – 145.7 = 11.8
           11.8/157.5 = 0.074
           0.074 × 100 =) 7.49/7.5%                                                                  [1]

     (c)   when tidal volume/VT increases, inspiratory reserve volume/IRV decreases by the
           same volume / any increase in tidal volume/VT is reciprocated by a fall in IRV;
           IRV volume decreases during exercise;
           tidal volume will increase during exercise;
           the IRV is additional inspired air over and above tidal volume/VT;                    [1 max]

     (d)   the greater volumes of VE max are due entirely to the combination of larger tidal
           volumes/VT and faster respiratory frequencies/ƒR during cycling;
           these increases are a result of the H+ ions produced from the breakdown of carbon
           dioxide stimulating the respiratory centres of the brain;
           the different posture required in cycling is thought to be a factor in producing
           higher levels in all three variables / OWTTE;
           smaller muscle mass recruited in cycle ergometry as opposed to treadmill running
           results in greater VE max in order to maintain a given oxygen consumption;
           reduced number of motor units recruited in cycle ergometry as opposed to
           treadmill running results in greater VE max in order to maintain a given oxygen
           consumption;
           the static nature of the upper body muscle contraction puts increased stress on the
           respiratory pump to get blood back into the chest cavity / makes the respiratory
           pump less effective;
           differences in the entrainment of muscles of the diaphragm / a change or resetting
           of the respiratory rhythm/rate;
           skill/motor control influencing motor unit recruitment patterns (for the two
           different modes of exercise);
           other differences in ventilation response to exercise between running and cycling
           include arterial oxygenation;
           oxygen diffusion capacity i.e. higher desaturation during running, explained by
           the crouched position on the bicycle, a decrease in thoracic volume;
           a lower efficiency of the peripheral muscle pump when cycling compared
           to running;                                                                           [3 max]
                                            –7–               M12/4/SPEXS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   standard deviation (SD) measures how much a set of data varies from the mean of
      that data / tells you the spread of the data about the mean;
      an estimate of the average variability / spread of a set of data measured in the
      same units of measurement as the original data / the square root of the variance;
      a small SD indicates that the data is clustered very close around the mean value,
      whereas a large SD indicates the data are spread out over a large range of values;
      e.g. the smaller SD for respiratory frequency / VE max during treadmill running
      suggests that the participants were more homogenous in their treadmill running
      responses;                                                                           [2 max]

(f)   25                                                                                       [1]
      Accept values 25–26.

(g)   significantly higher values of respiratory frequency have been reported for
      walking with versus without poles;
      chemoreceptors/changes in CO2/blood acidity levels (low pH) due to presence of
      hydrogen ions would have stimulated respiratory frequency due to higher
      workload in both conditions;
      lung stretch receptors/muscle proprioceptors i.e. when using poles, with the
      increase in the propulsive action of the upper body the interaction of the
      ventilatory rhythm may be impacted upon due to the proximity of the respiratory
      and locomotor muscles due to muscle proprioceptors / OWTTE;
      respiratory frequency/energy cost is higher when using poles (due to the added
      weight of the poles);
      combined with eccentric exercise involved with downhill walking, using the poles
      may have resulted in different/less efficient walk mechanics;
      it is also likely that an amplified arm swing while using hiking poles increases
      energy expenditure when contrasted with a natural and smooth no pole arm
      action / OWTTE;                                                                      [2 max]
                                                 –8–                M12/4/SPEXS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   glucose/monosaccharide                                                                    [1]

     (b)   carbohydrate – primary fuel source;
           lipid/fat – energy storage / structural component of membranes;
           protein – promotes growth and repair of muscle tissue;
           water – transporting nutrients/waste products / thermoregulation / helps maintain
           blood pressure / OWTTE;                                                               [2 max]
           Award [1] for macronutrient and role.

     (c)   the onset of exercise results in a fall in insulin output of the pancreas;
           as a result of increased blood flow provoked by the exercise, the insulin receptors
           on the muscle cells become more effective in transporting the hormone across the
           cell membrane;
           as a result of the lower insulin levels, the liver is stimulated to release
           stored glycogen/glucose;
           it is this hormonal balance system that keeps the level of blood glucose within the
           normal narrow range during exercise / OWTTE;
           insulin plays an important role in regulating glucose transport into
           skeletal muscle;
           the ability of insulin to bind to its receptors on muscle cells increases during
           exercise (increased blood flow to the muscles);
           the body’s sensitivity to insulin increases during exercise (reducing the need to
           maintain high plasma insulin concentration for transporting glucose into the
           muscle cells);                                                                        [2 max]
                                                  –9–               M12/4/SPEXS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   femur / tibia / patella;                                                                  [1]
           Award [1] for two correct responses.

     (b)   during the upward motion/preparation phase/hamstring curl the joint action
           is flexion;
           during the upward motion/preparation phase/hamstring curl the hamstring
           contracts concentrically/the quadriceps relaxes eccentrically;
           during the upward motion/preparation phase/hamstring curl the joint action
           is extension;
           during the downward motion/action phase quadriceps contracts concentrically
           while the hamstring relaxes eccentrically;
           during the downward motion/action phase quadriceps contracts concentrically
           and the joint action is extension;                                                    [3 max]
           Award [1] for identification of the joint action, [1] for identification of agonist
           muscle and type of contraction, [1] for antagonist muscle and type of contraction.
                                                 – 10 –             M12/4/SPEXS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   (a)   feedback for information about performance execution (knowledge of
           results)/outcome e.g. successful basket;
           knowledge of performance e.g. information about basketball shooting technique;
           feedback for reinforcement (either positive or negative);
           feedback as punishment;
           feedback as motivation;                                                                [2 max]

     (b)   the capacity of the short-term sensory store (STS) is regarded as limitless (storing
           massive amounts of sensory information without much recoding, i.e. the
           information is recorded in the same way as it came into the system in terms of
           spatial location and form);
           information is held in the STS for perhaps as little as one second;
           selected information may be passed onto the short-term memory (STM) for
           further processing;
           STM is the capacity for holding a small amount of information in mind in an
           active, readily available state for a short period of time;
           the duration of STM (when rehearsal or active maintenance is prevented) is
           believed to be in the order of seconds (estimates of STM capacity are 7 plus or
           minus 2 units, depending upon the experimental design used to estimate capacity);
           the STM receives coded stimuli from both the STS via selective attention and the
           long-term memory (retrieval);
           the STM sends information to the long term memory for future reference
           (rehearsal);
           the STM makes information available for decision making;                               [3 max]
           Responses should clearly identify differences in relation to capacity, duration or
           retrieval.

     (c)   PRP occurs when two stimuli are presented close together so that the reaction
           time to the second stimulus is slower than normal;
           if we detect a stimulus, and are processing that information whilst a second
           stimulus comes along, we are unable to attend to and process the second stimulus
           until we have finished processing the first one (single channel mechanism);
           the effect of this is to make our reaction time to the second stimulus longer;
           this increase in reaction time is referred to as the psychological refractory
           period/PRP;
           sport-specific example to explain how PRP explains deception in sport
           e.g. dodges/feints – look one way but pass/shoot in the opposite direction in
           soccer / drop shots in tennis / googlies/doosras in cricket;                           [3 max]
           Accept marking points in a sufficiently detailed schematic diagram.

(d)   progressive part practice is used when the skill is too complex/difficult for the
      learner / the component parts can be isolated / a lot of information processing is
      required;
      progressive part practice is useful when the mechanics/technique of the movement
      is important (e.g. closed skills such as swimming);
      progressive part breaks down a skill into its component parts e.g. breast-stroke
      swimming can be broken down into body position, the glide, the arm pull and
      the leg action;
      progressive part practice is used when there is an element of danger;
      progressive part practice is used to build confidence;                               [2 max]
      Award [1 max] for an example of progressive part practice in swimming.

                                               SECTION B

5.   (a)   (i)    origin is the attachment of a muscle tendon to a stationary bone;
                  insertion is the attachment of a muscle tendon to a moveable bone;                    [2]

           (ii)   the axial skeleton protects internal organs (e.g. the brain, spinal cord, heart
                  and lungs);
                  the axial skeleton acts as a calcium store;
                  the appendicular skeleton provides attachment points for muscles that
                  enable body movement;
                  the appendicular skeleton provides protection for reproductive organs;
                  the appendicular skeleton acts as a source of calcium / OWTTE;                    [3 max]

     (b)   ball and socket joint – mulitiaxial/polyaxial/permit movement around three axes;
           flexion and extension;
           abduction and adduction;
           rotation – bone revolves around its own longitudinal axis;
           circumduction – movement of the distal end of a body part in a circle;
           hyperextension;
           joint dislocation – displacement of a bone from a joint;                                 [4 max]

     (c)   high capillary density;
           high myoglobin content;
           high mitochondrial density;
           high triglyceride stores;
           high oxidative enzyme activity;
           high ability to generate ATP;
           fatigue level is low;                                                                    [4 max]
           Response to link these features to improved endurance performance.

(d)   (i)    bodies launched into the air (e.g. shot put) that are subject only to the forces
             of gravity and air resistance are termed projectiles;

             speed of release: [2 max]
             speed of release is defined as the magnitude of the projectile’s velocity
             vector at the instant of release;
             when projectile angle and height are held constant (e.g. an elite shot putter
             using the O’Brien technique), speed of release will determine range
             (horizontal displacement);
             the O’Brien technique increases speed by application of force over a longer
             period of time, as it incorporates a one and three quarter turn / OWTTE;

             height of release:
             for a given projection and speed angle, the greater the relative projection
             height the longer the flight time and greater the range (horizontal
             displacement);
             given that speed of release and angle of release are equal for two shot put
             athletes, the taller athlete has an advantage;

             angle of release: [2 max]
             angle of release is defined as the angle between the projectile’s velocity
             vector and the horizontal at the instant of release;
             activities requiring maximum horizontal range such as shot put tend to use
             smaller angles than those in which maximum height is the objective;
             between 35 and 45 degrees is the optimal angle of release for shot put which
             should be incorporated into the athlete’s technique;                               [4 max]

      (ii)   Newton’s first law (the law of inertia):
             the shot putter has to apply force to overcome the inertia of the shot /
             OWTTE;

             Newton’s second law (the law of acceleration):
             the O’Brien technique incorporates a one and three quarter turn/glide
             technique/rotation and enables force to be applied over a longer period of
             time and increasing the acceleration of the shot/transfer of momentum /
             OWTTE;

             Newton’s third law (the action/reaction law):
             for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction;
             the shot putter contracts their muscles to apply force against the
             ground (action);
             the ground applies an equal but opposite force against the shot putter
             (reaction);                                                                        [3 max]

6.   (a)   (i)    hemoglobin is the principal carrier of oxygen in the erythrocytes/red
                  blood cells / hemoglobin is the iron-containing oxygen transport protein in
                  the red blood cells / 98.5 %/high percentage of blood O2 is bound to
                  hemoglobin (in red blood cells);
                  at rest the oxyhemoglobin releases only a quarter of its oxygen to resting
                  tissues (50 ml l−1 ) / during strenuous aerobic sports, oxygen demand
                  increases and oxyhemoglobin releases up to 150 ml l−1 of its oxygen to the
                  working tissues / OWTTE;
                  hemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body, such as
                  the muscles;
                  the oxygen content of mixed venous blood falls dramatically during exercise
                  compared to resting levels;
                  it releases its load of oxygen to the supporting muscles;
                  each atom of iron is capable of binding to a molecule of O2 / each
                  hemoglobin molecule carries four molecules of oxygen;                              [2 max]

           (ii)   increased left ventricular volume;
                  increased left ventricular wall thickness/hypertrophy;
                  there is an increase in the strength potential of left ventricular contractions;
                  increased stroke volume at rest/during submaximal exercise for a
                  standardized workload/during maximal exercise;
                  left ventricle fills more during diastole;
                  blood plasma increases causing an increased end-diastolic volume;
                  increased contractility/elastic recoil increases the ejection fraction of
                  left ventricle;
                  these adaptations result in lower resting and submaximal heart rate for a
                  standard workload;
                  increased capillarization of trained muscles;
                  greater opening of existing capillaries in trained muscles;
                  more effective blood redistribution;
                  increased arterio-venous oxygen difference (a-VO2 difference);
                  heart rate recovery period is reduced / heart rate returns to its resting level
                  much more quickly after standardized sub maximal exercise/maximal
                  exercise;
                  resting blood pressure is generally reduced by endurance training;                 [4 max]

(b)   during static exercise systolic blood pressure increases;
      during static exercise diastolic blood pressure increases;
      this is due to increased resistance of the blood vessels due to:
      muscles squeezing the veins;
      increasing peripheral resistance;
      increasing intra-thoracic pressure due to the contraction of the abdominal muscles;
      increasing peripheral resistance reduces muscle perfusion;
      the magnitude/size of the hypertensive response relates directly to the intensity of
      the static effort;
      the magnitude of the hypertensive response relates directly to the amount of the
      muscle mass involved in static exercise;
      there appears to be no differences between racial groups in the diastolic or systolic
      blood pressure response to static exercise;                                             [4 max]

(c)   catabolism involves chemical reactions that break down complex organic
      compounds into simple ones / involves the network of chemical pathways in
      which molecules are broken down into smaller molecules / OWTTE;
      catabolic reactions are usually exergonic/exothermic (because they release more
      energy than they absorb) / catabolic reactions release the chemical energy stored
      in organic modules / OWTTE;
      the reactions involved in aerobic respiration are catabolic reactions that involve
      the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen / OWTTE;
      anaerobic glycolysis is the breakdown of glucose to lactic acid when limited
      amounts of oxygen/O2 are available / OWTTE;
      glycolysis plays a role in both aerobic and anaerobic ATP production / glycolysis
      does not require oxygen / anaerobic glycolysis / OWTTE;
      the process of glycolysis is the same regardless of whether oxygen is present or
      not / the presence of oxygen determines the fate of the end product of glycolysis;
      without oxygen the NADH molecules cannot be converted to ATP, and the
      pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid;
      in the presence of oxygen the three carbon pyruvate molecules lose a carbon atom
      and enters the citric acid cycle via acetyl coenzyme A, releasing carbon dioxide,
      water and ATP/ OWTTE;
      oxidation of glucose to produce ATP involves four sets of reactions (glycolysis,
      formation of a acetyl coenzyme A, the Krebs cycle, electron transport chain) /
      OWTTE;                                                                                  [4 max]

(d)   players of invasive team games e.g. soccer/rugby/hockey/basketball/netball –
      use three metabolic systems to provide the essential ATP needed for
      muscle contraction;
      ATP–CP, lactic acid and aerobic energy systems;
      in the ATP–CP system, inorganic phosphate (Pi) is separated from creatine
      phosphate (PCr) (through the action of creatine kinase);
      the Pi combines with ADP to form ATP (using the energy released from the
      breakdown of PCr);
      the ATP–CP system is anaerobic;
      the lactic acid system involves glycolysis, through which glucose/glycogen is
      broken down to pyruvic acid;
      when glycolysis occurs without oxygen, the pyruvic acid is converted to
      lactic acid;
      oxidation of carbohydrate/CHO involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the
      electron transport chain;
      fat oxidation begins with β-oxidation of free fatty acids and involves the Krebs
      cycle and the electron transport chain;
      energy yield for fat oxidation is much higher than for CHO oxidation;
      protein oxidation is more complex/contributes relatively little to energy
      production/generally less than 5 %;
      evaluated in terms of intensity and duration of the demands of the sport / the
      relative contribution of the pathways for ATP production differs, depending on
      exercise intensity and duration;
      in short-duration, intense exercise the ATP–CP system provide the energy
      for exercise;
      for less intense exercise of longer duration (1 to 2 minutes), anaerobic reactions of
      glycolysis generate most of the energy;
      as exercise progresses beyond several minutes the aerobic system predominates;          [6 max]
      Award [1] for an evaluation (implications and limitations) of each energy system,
      up to [3 max].
      Award [1] for an appropriate sporting example, from each energy system, up
      to [3 max].

7.   (a)   skill is learned/requires practice/results from experience;
           skill has an end result/is goal directed e.g. scoring one point from a free throw
           in basketball;
           skilled performers achieve their goals consistently/with consistency/with
           maximum certainty e.g. goal kicking in rugby;
           skill results in economic and efficient movement/well coordinated and precise
           movement whereas the novice is slow, error prone and awkward e.g. efficient
           sprint technique allowing maximum speed with controlled movement;
           a skilled performer can vary the timing of a movement according to the demands
           of the task e.g. a 1:2 pass in football;
           a skilled performer’s movement appears fluent/controlled/aesthetically pleasing
           e.g. figure skating routine/execution of dive;
           a skilled performer makes appropriate decisions/is a good “technician” who is
           able to use technique at the right moment;                                            [4 max]
           Award [2] for distinguishing characteristics and [2] for appropriate examples.
           A range of sport specific examples should be linked to consistency, accuracy,
           control, learned, efficiency, certainty, goal directed and fluency.

     (b)   pre-exercise screening is a key principle before sedentary individuals start
           becoming more physically active;
           determining one’s readiness for physical activity involvement is a prudent and
           important first step in the fitness assessment and exercise prescription process;
           the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) has been recommended
           prior to low to moderate exercise involvement;
           PAR-Q can be self-administered at one’s own convenience e.g. in one’s
           own home;
           PAR-Q is composed of seven questions that have been shown to be sensitive for
           detection of pre existing medical conditions/injuries;
           if an answer is yes to one or more of the PAR-Q questions it is essential to
           consult/talk with your doctor before commencing an exercise programme;
           if the answer is no to all PAR-Q questions, it can be reasonably assumed that it is
           safe to become more physically active;
           the possibility of undetected serious disease is diminished by administering
           the PAR-Q;
           the PAR-Q not only helps you determine your readiness to begin exercise, it also
           determines your readiness to intensify a physical activity/exercise programme;
           PAR-Q is designated to prevent sudden death syndrome;
           PAR-Q is designated to prevent muscle/joint/bone injuries;                            [4 max]

(c)   subjects run between two lines 20 m apart trying to keep up with a set of
      pre-recorded bleeps on a tape/CD;
      every minute the level changes (and the bleeps get closer together) and the
      running speed gets 0.5 km/h faster (start speed is 8.5 km/h);
      the athlete tries to keep up with the recording getting as many levels and shuttles
      into the test as possible;
      should an athlete miss two shuttles in a row they are excluded from the test;
      each score implies the test level and the number of shuttles completed
      successfully (e.g. 4/6 = level four and six shuttles completed);
      the runner stops when he/she can no longer maintain the running speed and his/her
      score is recorded as the final level and number of shuttles completed;
      this score can be used as a basic measure of aerobic fitness, which becomes a
      reference point against which future changes can be monitored;
      a validated table of values enables scores on the test to be converted into an
      estimate of maximum oxygen consumption;
      there are variations in the validated table for specific population groups;
      in order for the test results to be accurate and reproducible/comparable with scores
      obtained elsewhere, it is essential that the test procedures are carried out
      properly/in a standardised way/needs to be exact measurement of the 20-metre
      distance/use a standarised running surface/pre-test preparation/environmental
      conditions;
      medical clearance is required pre-test;
      the test starts slowly/there is a gentle warm-up as the test progresses;
      advisable to do some light jogging and gentle stretching before starting;
      the coach/teacher can test several subjects at the same time;
      possible to administer and test yourself;
      for the results to be valid, athletes must give their maximum effort when
      performing the test;
      large numbers of people can be tested at any one time, although the observers
      must be able to cope with the recording of levels and shuttles as athletes
      drop out;                                                                              [4 max]

(d)   three models of body composition: chemical (fat, protein, carbohydrate, water,
      mineral)/anatomical (adipose tissue, muscle, organs, bone, other)/
      two-compartment (fat mass, fat-free mass);
      the assessment of body composition provides additional information beyond the
      basic measures of height and weight;

      e.g. body mass index (BMI):
      WHO classification system for underweight, overweight and obese based on BMI
      values / racial/ethnic differences affect the relationship between BMI and obesity
      levels;
      standard height-weight tables do not provide accurate estimates of what an athlete
      should weigh because they do not take into account the composition of the weight
      / an athlete can be overweight according to the height-weight tables yet have very
      little body fat;
      the calculation is simple and easily repeated;
      reference values for different groups can lead to misinterpretation (underweight,
      overweight, obese, elite endurance, elite power/strength);

      e.g. skinfold fat thickness:
      most widely applied field technique to estimate body composition;
      recommended for accuracy that measurements from three or more skinfold sites
      be used (in a quadratic/curvilinear equation);
      linear equations underestimate the body density of lean people which causes over
      estimate of body fat/opposite for obese people (body density is overestimated and
      body fat is underestimated);
      there are limitations and reliability issues if the testing is taken by an
      inexperienced person;

      e.g underwater weighing:
      is the most widely used test of body density and in the past was the criterion
      measure for other indirect measures;
      the equipment required to do underwater weighing is expensive / tanks are mostly
      located at university or other research institutions, and there is generally not easy
      access for the general population;
      underwater weighing may underestimate body fat percentage of athletes as they
      tend to have denser bones and muscles than non-athletes, and may overestimate
      body fat percentage of elderly patients suffering from osteoporosis;
      relative body fat in lean athletic population tends to be overestimated with
      bioelectrical impedance;                                                                [6 max]
      Award [3 max] per method of testing.
