            accept any other relevant feature and description.

           N.B.
            Features are attributes and are not advantages or disadvantages of this
             organizational form.
            Do not accept “that partners may disagree with each other”.

(b)   Explain two benefits and one cost to SP of preparing a contingency plan of
      the three possible locations in Asia.                                      [6 marks]

      Possible benefits could include:
       A contingency plan enables SP to be proactive with regards to possible changes
        in the environment and to avoid crisis management. This planning enables
        Trent to cope with some negative effects in various countries and to reduce the
        risk of the unknown especially given the concern with regards to the
        earthquake / natural problem.
       It allows SP to reassure clients that their safety is crucial and that the company
        is planning ahead as far as possible to cover any possible problem.
       The contingency plan could be used in SP’s marketing materials to illustrate to
        new clients that SP provides the best service available to protect their USP.
       The contingency plan will allow SP to continue to charge high fees given the
        added value the contingency plan would add to the service the company offers.
       Accept any other relevant benefit.

      Possible costs could include:
       Opportunity costs of researching and preparing the contingency plan, in
        addition to any other financial costs such as hiring suitable consultants to
        advise SP.
       Accept any other relevant cost.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Mark as 4 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying each appropriate benefit to SP of preparing a
      contingency plan up to a maximum of [2 marks] and [1 mark] for an appropriate
      explanation of each benefit that directly refers to SP up to a maximum of
      [2 marks]. [4 marks] in total for two benefits.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying one appropriate cost to SP of preparing a
      contingency plan and [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation that directly refers
      to SP up to a maximum of [2 marks].

            The decision tree is not accurately constructed, the calculations of each
            option are not all presented or accurate, but there is some evidence of a
            general knowledge of the model.

            [3 to 4 marks]
            The principal elements of the decision tree are constructed, but may not be
            entirely accurate. The calculations of each option are largely correct and
            clearly presented at the top end of the markband. Working may not

            The decision tree is accurately constructed. The calculations of each option
            are correct and well presented. For [6 marks] a key is provided. Workings
            are shown.

(ii)   Comment on the value for SP of using a decision tree as a
       decision-making tool.                                     [3 marks]

       The decision tree will allow SP to:
        visually represent all possible offshoring options
        quantify the outcomes of each option in terms of expected values
         compared to cost
        incorporate the probabilities of the outcomes
        decide on an appropriate course of action based on quantitative factors
         only.

       Given the substantial non-financial factors in the stimulus (such as the level
       of earthquake risk) surrounding the contingency plan, the lack of non-
       financial considerations of the decision tree calculations reduces the value of
       the decision tree to SP as a decision-making tool.

       Accept any other relevant comment.


       N.B. It is not expected that the candidate produce a balanced response.

       Apply candidate Own Figure Rule (OFR).

       Award up to a maximum of [3 marks] for at least two relevant comments.

       Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] if there is no relevant application
       to SP.

(d) Examine two disadvantages for SP of subcontracting its recruitment and
    training of bodyguards.                                                [6 marks]

    The subcontracting of the recruitment and training to an external agency will
    create disadvantages for SP.

    Possible disadvantages could include:
     Direct financial costs like setting up the contract/relationship.
     There might be issues of quality and hence the delivery of the service.
      SP’s USP may be seriously eroded. SP may lose control of the whole quality
      of the bodyguard and the delivery of the service. It is mentioned in the
      stimulus material that quality of the service is vital to SP. One may say that SP
      outsources its core activity.
     Uncertainty about how the new external agency could impact on SP’s
      perception in the eyes of their customers. This is important given the
      importance of word-of-mouth promotion and the need to maintain the quality
      of customer service. One customer has already threatened not to use the
      service of SP.
     Costs of monitoring and maintaining the new subcontracting relationship.
     There could be considerable cultural issues to take into account when trusting
      and transferring these key functions to an external agency as it would appear
      that SP have limited experience of working within Asia.
     There will be time delays in establishing a new working relationship.
     Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

    However / possible balance:
     SP need to move quickly as the business is missing out on potential profits.
      Subcontracting to a specialist might enable SP to respond more quickly.
     It is stated that this option is cheaper (set-up cost) than offshoring.
     Perceived as “less risky” compared to offshoring as the decision can be more
      easily reversed in case the expected new level of demand in Asia is not
      sustained and thus is a much cheaper option than setting up an overseas branch.

    Accept any other relevant examination.


    N.B. It is not expected that the candidates incorporate all of the above
    points/issues.

    For one relevant disadvantage that is one-sided, with no examination award up to
    a maximum of [3 marks]. For two relevant disadvantages that are one-sided,
    with no examination award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

    Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Identify two features of an own label brand.                                         [2 marks]

           Features could include:
            A product created for a retailer by a supplier/manufacturer to be sold under the
             retailers own name or label.
            The own label branded product is commonly sold at a price by the retailer
             which is below the suppliers/manufacturers own branded price. For example,

           Economies of scale are defined as a cost saving which a business experiences
           when the long run unit costs or production costs fall as a business engages in
           larger-scale production. They can include managerial, financial and marketing.

(c)   Explain two benefits and one cost to GF of meeting national quality standards
      for its bread.                                                                [6 marks]

      Possible benefits could include:
       Marketing / USP especially.
       A point of difference from a major competitor like local supermarkets that do
        not meet the national quality standards, with an opportunity to build substantial
        brand loyalty and to charge higher price (by 20 %).
       Motivation for existing workers as they are working for a business recognized
        for its quality. Motivated employees may further increase efficiency and
        quality of the products.
       Recruitment of future workers may be quicker and hence cheaper especially if
        GF wishes to expand. Similarly, staff turnover may be low.
       Accept any other relevant benefit.

      Possible costs could include:
       Costs will revolve around complying with the requirements of the national
        quality standards such as buying technology, training, maintaining quality of
        ingredients etc.
       Costs of certification or obtaining a license or certificate.
       Inspection costs by outside agencies.
       Accept any other relevant cost.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      (ii)   Using relevant information given, calculate whether GF should either
             buy-in the additional 1200 loaves from the local supermarkets’ supplier,
             or make the loaves themselves (show all your working and state any
             assumptions you make).                                                   [5 marks]

             Any relevant methods used by the candidate should be rewarded provided
             the method used is accurate and full workings and any assumptions (if any)
             are shown. Candidates may calculate the contribution from each option or
             compare total costs in order to reach the answer. However, allow for any
             other relevant method of calculation provided workings are shown and
             stages are explained.

             Candidates are also expected to clearly present their calculations / findings.
             Some examples of calculations that could be included are shown below
             (all figures are in $):

             Method 1 (contribution costing):

             To buy-in 1200 loaves

             Contribution from buying-in is 6.8  6  0.8 per loaf.
             Additional contribution from buying in is 0.8 1200  $960 .

             Apply candidate Own Figure Rule (OFR).

             To make 1200 loaves
             If candidates assume that the semi-variable component is added at the
             contribution stage:

             Contribution from making  6.8 1.2  0.2  5.4 .
             Total contribution increase  5.4 1200  6480 .
             But increase in fixed cost 4000 (one-off cost) + 2000 (semi-variable
             component)  6000 .

             Hence net contribution increase is $480 (6480  6000) .


             If candidate assumes that the semi-variable 0.2 per loaf is absorbed into the
             fixed costs:

             Contribution from making  6.8 1.2  5.6 .
             Total contribution increase  5.6 1200  6720 .
             But increase in fixed costs 4000  2000  (1200  0.2)  6240 .
                                   – 13 –            M12/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Increase in contribution            from    making     themselves     is    still
$480 (6720  6240) .

GF should buy-in the 1200 loaves as the contribution is higher at
$480 (960  480) .

However the 4000 fixed cost is a one-off payment and subsequent additional
loaves for the hospitals will not have to incur this cost and contribution from
making will be higher than buying-in:

For the following year:
Contribution from making  6.8 1.2  0.2  5.4
Total contribution increase  5.4 1200  6480
Fixed cost  2000 (semi-variable component)

Hence contribution increase is $4480 (6480  2000) compared to $960 from
buying-in the 1200 loaves.

Method 2 (total cost approach):

Cost to buy  7200 (from stimulus)

Cost to make  FC  (VC  Q)
              (4000  2000)   (0.2  1.2) 1200 
              6000  1680
              7680

GF should buy-in to make a cost saving of: 7680  7200  $480 .
Accept any relevant method used.

(iii) Comment on whether GF should make or buy-in the additional
      1200 loaves.                                               [3 marks]

     The 1200 loaves from the local supermarket supplier is cheaper than GF.
      For Barbara to fulfil the order she should buy-in.
     A major non-financial concern however, is that the local supermarkets’
      supplier does not meet national quality standards and Barbara will be
      forced to check this bread carefully. This “checking cost” may also lead
      to an increase in GF’s costs.
     Producing the loaves themselves incurs a one-off cost of $4000. If GF
      produces more loaves in the future, Barbara will not incur additional
      future costs making the unit cost of making more loaves lower.

(e)   Analyse two reasons why GF should move from traditional quality control
      methods to a TQM approach.                                              [6 marks]

      Possible reasons could include:
       It may lead to productivity improvements as it is suggested that the current
        traditional quality control methods are time consuming. GF may be able to
        reduce future prices despite the current increase in cost of gluten-free flour
        making GF bread even more affordable.
       Long-run benefits once the new TQM system becomes established and workers
        are familiar with the new system and culture.
       The move to TQM may generate further orders if feedback from the hospitals
        is positive, allowing perhaps for flow production in the future. This could
        potentially reduce costs even further for GF.
       The practices of TQM like zero defects, quality chains, quality circles and so
        on will improve motivation given the empowerment, efficiency and
        productivity of GF employees. The benefits in terms of total revenue, costs
        and profit are obvious.

      However / possible balance:
       TQM will require a change of culture within GF. Changing spans of control
        and job descriptions via job enlargement. Some employees may resist the extra
        responsibilities and the changes.
       There will be short-run transitional issues. Costs such as training will increase.
        There may need to be changes in appraisal and rewards packages.
       Short-run disruption to production at a critical time when a large order is
        anticipated.
       Some resistance to change may be evident with the redeployment of the
        existing four quality control employees. Quality will be now every employee’s
        responsibility.

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    target market                                                                  [2 marks]

                  A target market is a chosen market by a business after carrying out
                  market research to identify a particular segment of a total population
                  (classified by age, gender, income level, lifestyle) and focus its marketing
                  effort on that segment. In the stimulus the $1.99 toy shop is aiming its
                  products at the lower income segment.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [0 marks] if the candidate writes “a target market is when a business

                  Stock turnover is the measurement of the speed with which a business sells
                  out its stock. A ratio can be used to measure the above. Stock turnover is
                  an efficiency ratio which measures how many times the current level of
                  stock in a store is “sold” or turned over. It is usually measured in the
                  number of trading days it takes to sell stock.

(b)   Explain two disadvantages of James using psychological pricing.                [6 marks]

      Disadvantages could include the following:
       Quality concerns of the low priced toys by customers. James may lose
        some quality conscientious parent customers.
       It will be difficult for James to be flexible around future pricing if the
        psychological price remains fixed at such low price in the minds of the
        customers. James’ flexibility in terms of pricing decisions may be
        reduced.
       Some customers may perceive this pricing strategy as unethical
        especially when children are targeted with the toys. Consumer groups
        might spread bad publicity about James. James might lose customers,
        sales and hence profit.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      discount / competitive pricing and produce some relevant points with
      regards to these pricing strategies.

      explanation with reference to James or the $1.99 toy shop up to a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] for each disadvantage if no relevant
      reference is made to the stimulus material.

(c)   Analyse two possible conflicts between stakeholders of the $1.99 toy shop.           [6 marks]

      A correct answer should analyse two conflicts to highlight both stakeholder
      positions. The potential conflicts from the stimulus are:

       Conflict between the        Nature of conflict
       $1.99 toy shop and
       Local toy manufacturers     Use of Chinese suppliers
       Parents                     Quality concerns and safety of toys
       Employee representative     Employing teenagers on very low wages
       (union official)
       Competitors                 Psychological pricing of the $1.99 toy shop seen
                                   as unethical
       Older customers             Queuing and customer service

      Possible conflicts which could be applied:
       James is trying to provide employment opportunities for teenagers and toys for
        low-income families. James could argue that this is “ethical”. This stance may
        conflict with the demand of the employees’ representative who wants
        more money. A possible increase in wages may result in higher prices which
        can upset the loyal customers. They may feel that their interest is
        negatively affected. The $1.99 toy shop may lose its customers and its
        competitive advantage. However, fewer customers may serve the interest of
        the older customers who are currently complaining about long queues and
        poor service. The service is likely to improve so a demand might increase on
        the older customers’ behalf. However, a possible higher price due to higher
        wages will serve the interest of the competitors but not the customers.
       Regarding the possible conflict between the competitors and James, there is no
        information in the stimulus material that the local authorities regard the toy’s
        pricing strategy as unethical, or an example of predatory pricing which is
        illegal in some countries. Perhaps the competitor prices are too high?
        James is not to blame for the $1.99 toy shop being too popular.
       An interesting conflict is between the interests of the parents. On the one hand
        they would like cheap and affordable toys. On the other hand they are
        concerned about the quality of the imported toys from China.
       The creation of the social networking web site is a move by James to try and
        reduce the conflict by offering customers a chance to put forward their views,
        although this may not satisfy the older customers who may not feel
        comfortable in using social networking web sites.

(d)   Discuss whether the introduction of the $4.99 toy shop as a new strategy will
      change customer perceptions of James’ two shops.                              [9 marks]

      There is considerable evidence from the stimulus that the new shop will address
      some of the current concerns which James faces. James has clearly taken on
      board many of the comments from the stakeholders. The major issue is whether
      customer perceptions will change accordingly to allow the $4.99 shop to be
      viewed as a separate shop rather than the same shop as the $1.99 toy shop selling
      the same products for $3 more.

      Possible analysis could include the following:
       It would appear that the $1.99 toy shop has reached saturation and has become
        overcrowded. The new $4.99 shop might allow James to increase stock
        turnover and provide better customer service. It is hoped that the new shop
        will change customer perceptions to be more favourable. However, James will
        have to promote the shop differently and explain the reasons for the increase in
        price.
       If some customers are willing to pay higher price for a less crowded shop and
        better service, the new shop will boost turnover and increase profitability
        assuming that direct costs remain the same. The new shop should also ease
        crowding in the $1.99 toy shop. Hence, some customers might not see the
        point of opening a more expensive shop.
       The new $4.99 shop may create confusion and hence will not change consumer
        perceptions. Although the price is twice as expensive it is still relatively cheap.
        The positioning of the new toys might not have changed considerably, or not at
        all. Customers may refuse to pay the extra price especially if imported from
        the same suppliers in China. James may lose his competitive advantage.
       If James is to move out of a poor area, will the new price, which is still
        rather low, be sustainable?
       James may have to spend a considerable amount of money on marketing in
        order to reposition his toys. This is quite unlikely to be successful given the
        fact that there is limited information in the stimulus material that the quality
        has increased and that James has found a different supplier. Many people
        might want evidence rather than an announcement on the social networking
        web site that the quality has improved. The current targeted market might not
        buy into the announced change.
       Or will the $4.99 shop cannibalize the $1.99 toy shop’s market? Or will the
        $1.99 toy shop become even more overcrowded as consumers ignore the new
        shop?
       There is no evidence in the stimulus material that James has carried out
        research into the market for its new targeting strategy.

Judgment:
It appears that the new strategy is unlikely to be successful as the arguments
against seem to be more significant especially in the short run. Moreover, the
interest of some customers may still not be fulfilled. Will James be able to offer
higher wages?

Some customers are already sceptical and cannot see justification for a $3 increase
in price possibly just for a better service.

Perhaps James should carry out further market research about the option.

4.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    appraisal                                                                       [2 marks]

                  Is the process of evaluating the effectiveness / performance of a process or
                  as in this case, the employees. In the process the goals and outcome are
                  compared.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   strike action.                                                                  [2 marks]

                  Strike action is considered to be a “weapon of last resort” when negotiations
                  between employee representatives and employers fail to come up with a
                  solution to conflict resolution. It involves employees collectively walking
                  out of the job and refusing to continue working until a new offer in the
                  negotiation process has been made. In many countries, employees have to
                  vote for strike action.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.
                  A shorter definition is acceptable.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and

(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to the two managers of MHS
      being a public-private partnership.                                   [6 marks]

      Possible advantages could include:
       Clearly as a new innovative school with a flexible approach to
        teaching/learning the public-private partnership will ensure that sufficient
        finance will be available to get the school up and running. The private sector
        investors can supplement the state funding to ensure that up-to-date technology
        is purchased. This will enable Julian to implement the innovative teaching
        method.
       The private sector alone may be unwilling to fully fund the development of the
        school given the degree of risk involved with this project.
       A synergy can be created between the business knowledge of the managers and
        the government educational aims. A highly innovative school can be led by
        Julian with educational objectives set by the government.
       Accept any other relevant advantage.

      Possible disadvantages could include:
       There might be some conflict of interest between the managers who might see
        themselves as representing the interest of the private sector and the
        government.
       Although an agreement has been made and there are two appointed managers,
        it might be difficult for some stakeholders to know exactly who is in charge
        and whose objectives should be perused, the public or the private sectors.
        Should MHS be a non-profit organization, or should profit be the main
        objective?
       Who is responsible if the school begins to fail?
       Given cuts in public spending, Charles, the finance director may have to seek
        new sources of finance to maintain the partnership given that 60 % of the
        funding for MHS comes from the public sector. The uncertainty of the flow of
        future finance might somewhat reduce the effectiveness of both managers in
        terms of future planning.
       Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Mark as 3 + 3.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying one appropriate advantage/disadvantage,
      [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation that directly refers to MHS and [1 mark]
      for a further development of this explanation up to a maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Analyse the importance of the informal organization to MHS.                          [6 marks]

      The informal organization could refer to a number of different aspects highlighted
      in the stimulus:
       communication
       decision-making
       leadership and management.

      The importance of the informal organization:
       It allows Julian to be flexible and work closely with the students who have
        been specifically chosen to make this school innovative and flexible. The
        informal organization may speed up the process of change or the decision itself
        in a new school environment. A flexible and innovative decision-making
        environment would require a culture to match which would probably be
        informal.
       Some students may feel empowered by this informal communication and by
        being part of the decision-making system and this may lead to increased
        motivation. However, the stimulus material gives indication that this was not
        the case given the falling number of applicants.
       The informal meeting with the student may enable Julian to tap on the
        creativity and the enthusiasm of some students. The decision-making process
        is likely to improve and be in line with the essence of the schools’ flexibility
        and innovation.

      However / possible balance:
       The staff are clearly excluded from the informal communication process and
        ironically has to resort to speaking to Charles informally without Julian
        knowing. The informal organization lies at the heart of the conflict.
       Evidence that the informal system is undermining teaching staff confidence
        especially with respect to appraisal and the lack of contracts even though
        rewards packages are generous.
       There is evidence that some students may not be turning up for class or
        handing in work hence the organization may be seen as possibly too informal.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      It is not expected that candidates will include all of the above points in
      their answer.

      A balanced response is one that covers at least two issues for and at least two
      issues against.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum
      of [3 marks]. For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis
      award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss two approaches to conflict resolution at MHS.                                  [9 marks]

       One resolution could be a discussion and negotiation / consultation within
        MHS. Some employees’ representatives may attempt to negotiate contracts
        based on job analysis, job description, personal specification as well as
        possibly 360 degree appraisal system. The process may take time and some
        payments will have to be made to some expert in the short run, however, in the
        long run the boundaries will be set and human resource management (HRM)
        will be transparent.
       Another resolution could include going to arbitration and conciliation as there
        does seem to be a significant disagreement between the staff and Julian.
        This will take time and resources. How much negotiation will be possible
        given Julian’s current strong position? Given the facts that there are no official
        contracts and no official appraisal system, it might be difficult for the teachers
        and their representatives to argue of injustice. The lack of transparency may
        prove the management of MHS to be strong. However, it might be in the
        interest of the management to solve the conflict especially given the fall in
        applications and to act upon the advice given.
       The no-strike agreement may be popular with Julian, but how will this be
        enforced if there are no legal employment contracts? The teachers are likely to
        reject this option. Julian may be forced to draw up contracts for the teaching
        staff taking additional time and resources as well as further negotiation.
       Another solution is to restructure the organization, changing the hierarchy of
        the school to include some members of the teaching staff in the future
        decision-making and direction of the school. The school will also have to
        review its current systems around recruitment and appraisal to bring about a
        resolution but this may cede control away from Julian who may not be pleased.
        Communication networks can be formalized within MHS with less reliance on
        the informal network which seems to be a key driver in the schools
        development. This will of course impact on Julian’s ability to be flexible and
        innovative.
       Perhaps the current culture is unsustainable? The public-private partnership
        may need to be reviewed with all stakeholders present. However, this will take
        additional time.

      Given the nature of the problem, it appears that negotiation / consultation with the
      employees is the best method especially in the long run. Transparent HRM
      practices will reduce current and future disputes. Given the interest of the two
      opposing groups to solve the current problems, it is likely to be successful.
      Having established the foundation for HRM, perhaps other methods can be used.
      Moreover, a willingness of the management to involve the teachers and to
      establish a transparent system might increase motivation, consequently, student
      satisfaction rate may increase and more students may be willing to apply.

      Accept any other substantiated judgment.

5.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    market share                                                                    [2 marks]

                  Market share is defined as the sales of an individual business expressed as a
                  percentage of total industry sales.

                                      total revenue the business generates

                  defined as a company’s share of the market.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and

                  An extension strategy is used by businesses to try and inject new life
                  (in terms of increased sales revenue thereby prolonging the product
                  life cycle) into products when they have reached the saturation point.
                  Extension strategies may include product enhancements or upgrades,
                  new pricing methods or new short-term promotions.

(b)   Explain two values of a marketing audit as a business tool for CC.                   [6 marks]

      Values of a marketing audit for CC could include:
       Given that CC is currently unprofitable, it would seem appropriate to conduct a
        marketing audit to assess where the organization is. A marketing audit enables
        CC to identify its strengths and weaknesses in terms of the 7Ps. It looks like
        CC was able to identify customers’ perceptions with regard to their 4 products.
       Moreover, with the information found as well as information about market
        growth and existing market share, CC management can have a thorough
        product portfolio analysis (BCG matrix). The answer to the first question, can
        give CC a sound bases for objectives and strategies.
       It will determine whether the current promotional mix is appropriate
        (see below) and allow CC to adapt any of their marketing mix accordingly in
        light of their limited marketing budget.
       It may give more insight into customers’ opinion and perceptions about
        whether to continue production of The Ventura.

      Accept any other relevant value and explanation.

      N.B. Do not credit twice for an explanation that refers to any of the 7Ps, such as
      the value regarding the price and promotion and so on.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying each appropriate value, [1 mark] for an
      appropriate explanation that directly refers to CC and [1 mark] for a further
      development of this explanation up to a maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Analyse the implications for the CEO of converting CC into four cost centres. [6 marks]

      The possible arguments for converting CC into four cost centres could include:
       In an unprofitable business the idea of turning each espresso coffee machine
        into a cost centre is sensible. In an attempt to reduce costs CC will find it
        easier to identify the product(s) that incurred most of the costs and the reasons
        why.
       Action can be taken where the problem / inefficiency is created. It would
        appear that this is the area which is needed most for The Ventura and
        The Fortuna espresso machines.
       The setting up of cost centres and the market audit could then determine which
        espresso coffee machine needs the greater share of the limited
        marketing budget possibly in terms of training, capital investment etc.
       More direct accountability decision making / empowerment and control for
        managers in these centres with accompanying motivational benefits.
       Constructive competition between the various cost centres can further improve
        efficiency.
       It allows the implementation of cell production so as to improve efficiency and
        motivation.

      However:
       This new change to cost centres will require a new culture and organizational
        structure at CC which will take time and resources to embed and prepare.
       Destructive and unnecessary competition may be created. Employees might
        lose sight of the interest of the whole organization and concentrate only on
        their product. The CEO will have to ensure that individual cost centres do not
        set individual objectives which may contradict with the overall CC objective.
       Cost centres may encourage short-term outlook. For example, The Crema
        which is the most expensive machine to produce but is showing the highest
        potential for growth may be currently unfairly judged. Would profit centres be
        a more equitable approach?
       Coordination and communication of activities will need to be reviewed as the
        four brands will now be effectively stand alone businesses.
       A “fair” allocation of the indirect costs of CC will need to be considered if the
        cost centre idea is to have value. How will this be decided?

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

(d)   Discuss whether the family should accept the offer of a strategic alliance with
      its competitor.                                                                 [9 marks]

       The offer will allow CC to continue trading as it would appear that three of the
        four espresso coffee machines are struggling and the company is currently
        unprofitable.
       Vital funds will be available to support The Rocket and The Fortuna which it is
        argued from the stimulus requires the greatest marketing support.
       The strategic alliance could also support The Crema which looks like the
        product with the greatest market growth potential.
       The strategic alliance will fund the possibility of CC moving into
        international markets which will allow for greater growth of market share
        especially of The Rocket which is currently a cash cow.
       Forming a strategic alliance with its main competitor can be seen as a
        significant argument as CC can easily eliminate competition and together have
        more power in the market.
       A strategic alliance is a very loose form of cooperation. It is cheap and can
        easily be reversed.

      However:
       Family member concern around the loss of The Ventura is considerable and a
        significant argument. If the Ventura is discontinued, there may be other some
        brand erosion implications, unless the customers are aware of the CC overall
        name and espresso coffee machines names. There may be consumer backlash
        against CC. It is after all the most recognizable brand name. The Ventura has
        considerable brand loyalty compared to The Fortuna and The Rocket.
       Will any proposed brand awareness and extension strategies for these two
        machines be funded by the alliance be cost effective?
       It will be hard to measure exactly how much CC will need to spend in order to
        generate brand loyalty to The Fortuna and The Rocket. The Rocket’s issues
        are also quality control driven and not just marketing.
       If the financial position does not improve, CC could be subject to a
        takeover and lose all of its espresso coffee machines.

      Judgment:
      Ultimately, the decision rests with the family. Survive and possibly expand into
      new international markets, but drop their most recognizable machine from
      their portfolio. There could be considerable consumer resistance but with the
      marketing support especially promotion, CC can explain the commercial reasons
      for such action and assure the customers.

      However, by refusing the offer CC may be jeopardizing the other three of its
      machines from fulfilling their market potential through a lack of finance.
      The company is currently unprofitable. It could become the target of a takeover if
      the financial situation deteriorates.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.

      N.B. This question is about strategic alliance. Do not credit candidates that
      present the benefits or otherwise of a takeover and/or merger.
