1.       (a)   Explain why, in markets dominated by a few firms, prices may remain
               relatively stable.                                                                [10 marks]

               Answers should include:
                an explanation of “markets dominated by a few firms” as oligopoly
                an explanation of stable prices in terms of at least one theory of oligopoly,
                 such as:
                 – use of the kinked demand curve model and diagram
                 – price leadership aspects of collusive oligopoly
                 – the operation of cartels.

               Answers may include:
                non-price competition
                a plausible general explanation of why prices are particularly likely to be
                 rigid in a downwards direction.

               Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
               which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   “An industry with a larger number of firms will experience lower prices
      and greater efficiency than an industry with a smaller number of firms.”

(b)   Evaluate the extent to which the use of expansionary demand-side policies
      may lead to conflicts between the various goals of macroeconomic policy.            [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
       a definition of demand-side policies
       an explanation of expansionary demand-side policies in terms of fiscal and
        monetary policies
       expansionary fiscal policies involving a reduction in taxation and/or a rise in
        government spending and expansionary monetary policies most likely
        involving lower interest rates and possibly an expansion of the money
        supply
       an explanation of expansionary demand-side policies aiming to increase
        growth and to decrease unemployment/to avoid deflation/to get out of
        recession
       the possible conflict between expanding demand to reduce unemployment
        and the goal of lower inflation (the short run and long run Phillips curves
        and the natural rate of unemployment)
       the adverse consequences on long-run economic growth of higher rates of
        inflation
       the possible conflict between expanding demand and a deteriorating balance
        of payments on current account leading to exchange rate depreciation and
        imported inflation
       use of AD/AS diagram to illustrate expanding aggregate demand with AS
        curves of different shapes; e.g. the importance of spare capacity in the
        economy
       the extent to which conflicts may be avoided through the use of
        accompanying supply-side policies
       evaluation of the above arguments.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences

             current account
            an explanation of possible consequences.

           Answers may include:
            an explanation of various consequences, such as:
             – possibility of financing the deficit in the short run through running down
                foreign exchange reserves
             – the need to borrow foreign exchange in the long-run, with conditions
                imposed by lenders such as the IMF
             – the need to reduce the deficit in the long-run, e.g. through deflationary
                demand-side policies
             – the deficit may engender a cycle of further deficits
             – the possibility of a current account deficit as a reflection of higher living
                standards
             – the need to counter the current account deficit with a capital account
                surplus, possibly through higher interest rates
             – the downward pressure on the exchange rate
             – the need to increase interest rates in order to attract foreign funds
             – the likely depreciation/devaluation resulting from the deficit
            a suitable diagram.

(b)   Evaluate the view that balance of payments deficits on current account are
      best resolved through the use of supply-side policies.                         [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
       a definition of balance of payments
       a definition of supply-side policies
       an explanation of supply-side policies
       examples of supply-side policies
       an explanation of the link between successful supply side policies and an
        improvement in the current account deficit in terms of a shift of the LRAS
        to the right, lower inflation and more competitive export prices
       the disadvantages of particular supply-side policies
       supply-side policies as a long-run solution
       the advantages and disadvantages of using other policies such as exchange
        rate depreciation, expenditure reducing policies and expenditure switching
        policies
       use of appropriate diagrams, e.g. AD/AS
       evaluation of above arguments.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.
