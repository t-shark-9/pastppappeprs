Abnormal psychology

1.   Discuss validity and reliability of diagnosis.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     addresses various aspects of validity and reliability of diagnosis. Conclusions should be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence. Although a discussion of both validity and
     reliability is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     The terms “validity” and “reliability” need to be consistently and appropriately used throughout
     the response. Validity is the extent to which the diagnosis is accurate. The key concern is whether
     diagnostic systems correctly diagnose people who really have particular disorders and do not give a
     diagnosis to people who do not. In regard to reliability, responses may refer to two types of
     reliability: inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability. Inter-rater reliability can be assessed by
     asking professionals to observe the same person and, using the same classification system, to make
     a diagnosis. If clinicians make the same decision, the system is reliable. Test-retest reliability
     indicates whether the same person will receive the same diagnosis if they are assessed more than
     once by the classification system. Those candidates who refer to a classification system in the
     discussion of validity and reliability of diagnosis should earn credit.

       Examples of research that could be used include:
      studies of inter-rater reliability reveal that some diagnostic categories are more reliable than
         others, and that diagnosis is more reliable for some types of patients than others (Nicholls et al.
         2000).
      Mary Seeman (2007) completed a literature review to examine evidence relating to the reliability
         of diagnosis over time and found that initial diagnoses of schizophrenia in women, in particular,
         were susceptible to change as clinicians found out more information about their patients.
         This research indicates a problem of test-retest reliability with schizophrenia.
      Wakefield et al. (2007) conducted a study that suggested that many life events
         (e.g. death of loved one, divorce, loss of job) can account for the appearance of some symptoms
         of depression, but do not meet the criteria for clinical depression. This study addresses the
         validity of diagnosis.

     In practice, professional diagnoses can be influenced by biases and subjective viewpoints of the
     diagnostician.

     If a candidate discusses only validity or only reliability, apply the markbands up to a maximum
     of [11 marks].
                                                 –5–              M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Evaluate the use of group approaches to treatment of one anxiety, affective or eating disorder.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of using group approaches to treatment of one anxiety, affective or eating
     disorder, i.e. whether a specific group approach is appropriate and effective. Although a discussion
     of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain
     high marks.

     Approaches to treatment may include, but are not limited to, encounter group therapy, family
     therapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy.

     Many people seeking help prefer a group approach to treatment over an individual approach
     to treatment, largely because of the comfort derived from knowing that others share their problems.
     Responses may evaluate group approaches to treatment/therapy making reference to:
      appropriateness of therapy/treatment for a specific disorder and effectiveness of treatment
      discussion of supporting/challenging empirical research and findings.

     The major focus of the response should be on an evaluation of group approaches, rather than a
     descriptive overview of treatments. Evaluation should also focus on the use of group approaches to
     treatment for a specific disorder, not just group approaches in general. Evaluation may include
     strengths and limitations of the selected research.          Legitimate evaluation may refer to
     methodological, cross-cultural, gender and ethical considerations.

     Candidates may evaluate a smaller number of group approaches in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may evaluate a larger number of group approaches in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on the
     quality of the evaluation presented.

     If a candidate evaluates the use of group approaches in relation to more than one anxiety, affective
     or eating disorder, credit should be given only to the evaluation of the first disorder.

     If a candidate evaluates the use of group approaches to treatment in relation to schizophrenia, no
     marks should be awarded.

     If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for
     criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A, knowledge and
     comprehension.
                                                  –6–              M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Examine how one or more biological factor(s) influence either one specific anxiety disorder
     or one specific eating disorder.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider the influence of biological factors in
     ways that uncover the relationship between the chosen biological factor(s) and the selected disorder.

     Responses are likely to refer to biological factors, such as:
      the role of genes
      brain damage
      biochemical factors (e.g. hormones and neurotransmitters).

     Support for the role of biological factors in disorders comes from research studies investigating the
     effectiveness of psychopharmacological treatment. A large and growing range of drugs has been
     developed to deal with anxiety and eating disorders. Although these drugs are beneficial, it is not
     clear if they address the root causes of such disorders or simply mask the symptoms.

     Cognitive and sociocultural factors may be legitimately considered if they are shown to influence,
     or be influenced by, biological factors.

     Responses that examine biological factors of depression or any mood disorder should not be
     awarded any marks.

     Candidates may examine one biological factor in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may
     examine more than one biological factor in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on the quality of the
     examination presented.

     If a candidate examines how one or more biological factor(s) influence one affective disorder or
     schizophrenia, no marks should be awarded.

     If a candidate examines one or more biological factors in relation to more than one specific anxiety
     disorder and/or one specific eating disorder, credit should be given only to the examination of the
     first disorder.
                                                  –7–              M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Developmental psychology

4.   Contrast two examples of psychological research (theories and/or studies) into adolescence.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “contrast” requires candidates to give an account of differences between two
     theories or studies related to adolescence.

     If a candidate chooses to contrast two theories they are not required to include studies to back up
     their argument.

     Relevant content may refer to traditional theories of “Storm and Stress”, such as:
      Anna Freud’s adolescence theory
      Erikson’s identity theory.

     Many studies may be contrasted, such as:
      Marcia’s identity studies
      Mead’s anthropological studies
      Rutter’s et al. studies.

     Contrasting psychological research in terms of methodology in the research studies should be given
     credit if there is reference to adolescence.

     If a candidate contrasts more than two examples of psychological research, credit should be given
     only to the contrast of the first two examples.
                                                  –8–                M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Discuss strategies to build resilience.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review,
     supported by appropriate evidence, of two or more strategies to build resilience.

     Responses may define resilience but it is not necessary. Responses could refer to specific
     programmes to build resilience, such as home visit programmes, parent training, Head Start and
     after school programmes, as well as more individual approaches.

     Issues in relation to resilience programmes could focus on protective and vulnerability factors in the
     child’s environment, such as:
      characteristics of the families within which the child lives
      characteristics of their physical environment
      characteristics of their social environment.

     Individual characteristics could also be focused on, such as:
      capacity to make realistic plans
      self-efficacy
      skills in communication and problem solving
      capacity to manage strong feelings and impulses.

     Candidates may discuss a smaller number of strategies in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge,
     or may discuss a larger number of strategies in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on the quality of the
     discussion presented.
                                                  –9–              M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Discuss psychological research (theories and/or studies) related to the potential effects
     of deprivation or trauma in childhood on later development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of
     psychological research (theories and/or studies) related to the potential effects of deprivation or
     trauma in childhood on later development. Conclusions should be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.

     If candidates discuss two theories they are not required to include studies to back up their argument.
     Candidates could choose to discuss traditional deterministic theories of deprivation, but an
     alternative approach could be to focus on research dealing with how resilience and protective
     factors reduce the impact of deprivation or trauma in childhood. Answers may address biological,
     cognitive or sociocultural factors in relation to potential effects of deprivation or trauma in
     childhood on later development.

     Potential effects of deprivation may be discussed with reference to research, such as:
      Cyrulnik’s theory of resilience
      Bowlby’s maternal deprivation hypothesis
      Rutter (1981) and Rutter et al. (2001)
      Werner (2005).

     Credit should be given to any discussion of both topics listed in the question. Candidates may
     discuss one topic in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss both topics in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may discuss a smaller number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate depth
     of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate
     breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on
     the quality of the discussion presented.

Health psychology

7.   Outline two stressors.

     Evaluate one strategy for coping with stress.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account or summary of two
     relevant stressors. Additional elaboration is not necessary. Evaluation of a coping strategy requires
     the candidate to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and limitations of the chosen
     coping strategy. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not
     have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     The coping strategy evaluated does not have to refer to stressors outlined by the candidate.

     Stressors refer to factors that cause stress. These could encompass factors such as living in a
     violent neighbourhood, unemployment, death of a spouse, overwhelming workload, relationship
     stress or being diagnosed with a disease. Some of these factors have been identified and evaluated
     in the Holmes and Rahe Scale of life events (1967). However, Robert Sapolsky (2001) argues that
     humans are special in that the brain can create psychological stress all by itself just by worrying
     about what might happen. The physiological stress response is the same whether the stressor is real
     or imagined.

     Lazarus defined “coping” as the process of managing stressors in order to return to some sort of
     normal functioning. This process can involve:
      dealing with the emotional aspects of the stress (emotion-focused coping)
      trying to remove or correct the problem (problem-focused coping).

     Coping strategies could include:
      social support
      mindfulness-based stress reduction
      yoga
      hardiness training
      using different drugs to alleviate the stress.

     There may be gender and cultural differences in the use of coping strategies, but any relevant
     coping strategy could be used in the response as long as there is reference to relevant research and
     evaluation of the chosen coping strategy. Candidates may conclude that a specific coping strategy
     is not effective, e.g. using a drug, and this should be given credit.

     If a candidate evaluates more than one strategy, credit should be given only to the evaluation of the
     first strategy, unless the other strategy or strategies are clearly used to evaluate the main strategy,
     for example, used in comparison and/or contrast to the main strategy.

     If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for
     criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A, knowledge and
     comprehension.
                                                  – 11 –             M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


8.   Discuss one prevention strategy for obesity.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of the
     chosen prevention strategy that includes a range of arguments. Conclusions should be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence relevant to the chosen prevention strategy.

     Prevention strategies could include health campaigns which aim to change an individual’s lifestyle
     by targeting healthier eating, more exercise or both. Candidates may refer to WHO or national
     health campaigns, such as the Eatwell Plate from the UK. Other strategies could include, but are
     not limited to:
      requiring calorie listing in fast food restaurants
      changing school lunch programmes
      replacing high calorie products with low calorie products in vending machines in schools
      exercise programmes in schools.

     Responses could make reference to research (theories and/or studies), which relates to a specific
     prevention strategy. For example, Huhman et al. (2005) conducted a survey to investigate the
     effectiveness of a campaign to create awareness of the importance of physical exercise for children.

     If a candidate discusses more than one prevention strategy, credit should be given only to the
     discussion of the first prevention strategy, unless the other strategy or strategies are clearly used to
     evaluate the main strategy, for example, used in comparison and/or contrast to the main strategy.
                                                  – 12 –            M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.   Evaluate one treatment for substance abuse or addictive behaviour.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of the strengths and
     limitations of one treatment for substance abuse or addictive behaviour. Although a discussion of
     both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     The response could refer to a treatment for either a specific substance abuse (e.g. alcohol, cannabis,
     ecstasy) or addictive behaviour (e.g. a substance like tobacco or a behaviour like Internet addiction,
     sex or gambling). Candidates may choose an alternative approach where they evaluate a treatment
     with no reference to a specific substance abuse or addictive behaviour. Comparison or contrast with
     other treatments can be a legitimate approach if it is used to highlight the strengths and limitations
     of the treatment being evaluated by the candidate.

     Referring to eclectic approaches to treatment of substance abuse or addictive behaviour is a
     legitimate strategy for answering the question, since many treatments now include eclectic
     approaches.

     Treatments related to substance abuse and addictive behaviour include:
      use of antabuse – a drug found to have a positive effect
      use of antabuse in combination with family therapy or CBT
      Alcoholics Anonymous
      nicotine replacement
      nicotine replacement in combination with group therapy.

     Credit should be given to any evaluation of both topics listed in the question. Candidates may
     evaluate one topic in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may evaluate both topics in
     order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate evaluates more than one treatment, credit should be given only to the evaluation of
     the first treatment. However, if a candidate evaluates one treatment and then explains how
     that treatment can be used in conjunction with another treatment, the whole discussion should
     receive credit.

     If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for
     criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A, knowledge and
     comprehension.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   To what extent do biological factors influence human relationships?

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contributions of biological
      factors in human relationships. Candidates may argue the extent of this influence by also
      addressing the influence of cognitive and/or sociocultural factors on human relationships. In
      addition cognitive and or sociocultural factors may be legitimately considered if they are shown to
      influence, or be influenced by, biological factors. However, answers should be supported with
      appropriate evidence and sound argument and the conclusion should clearly indicate the extent to
      which biological factors influence human relationships.

      Responses may refer to evolutionary theories as well as physiological factors, such as hormones,
      neurotransmitters and the result of brain damage or brain disease. Evidence may be provided from
      any area of the option, for example:
       evolutionary explanations of pro-social behaviour and altruism
       hormonal influence on attraction, violence, trust and bonding
       Capgras’ syndrome.

      Candidates may consider a smaller number of biological factors and/or types of human
      relationships in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may consider a larger number of
      biological factors and/or types of human relationships in order to demonstrate breadth
      of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on the
      quality of the consideration presented.
                                                   – 14 –             M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


11.   Discuss research (theories and/or studies) related to why relationships may change or end.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of
      research (theories and/or studies), including a range of arguments, as to why relationships may
      change or end. Conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
      The major focus of the response should be on a discussion of research, rather than a descriptive
      overview of the factors that may influence relationships to change or end.

      If a candidate discusses two theories, the candidate is not required to include studies to back up their
      argument.

      Theories could include, but are not limited to:
       social exchange theory
       equity theory
       patterns of accommodation
       attachment styles.

      Studies could include, but are not limited to:
       Flora and Segrin (2003) on the role of perception of the relationship
       Duck et al. (1988) on the role of age differences in couples
       Duck (1992) on the role of socioeconomic differences in couples.

      Responses may focus on theories or studies alone, but may also combine theories and studies.
      Each of these approaches to answering the question are acceptable.

      Credit should be given to any discussion of both topics listed in the question. Candidates may
      discuss one topic in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss both topics in order to
      demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

      Candidates may discuss a smaller number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate depth
      of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate
      breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on
      the quality of the discussion presented.
                                                     – 15 –         M12/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   Evaluate psychological research (theories and/or studies) on factors influencing bystanderism.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of research (theories and/or
      studies) related to bystanderism by weighing up strengths and limitations of the research. Although
      a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to
      gain high marks.

      In choosing psychological research related to bystanderism, candidates may choose to focus either
      on research that examines why people become bystanders, or why individuals choose not to be
      bystanders, or a combination of both. If a candidate discusses two theories, the candidate is not
      required to include studies to back up their argument.

      Theories may include, but are not limited to:
       diffusion of responsibility
       pluralistic ignorance
       deindividuation.

      Studies may include, but are not limited to:
       Piliavin et al. (1969)
       Latané and Darley (1968)
       LeVine’s (1990) cross-cultural study.

      The major focus of the response should be on an evaluation of research, rather than a descriptive
      overview of the factors that influence bystanderism. Evaluation may include strengths and
      limitations of the selected research, but could also make reference to application.
      Legitimate evaluation may refer to methodological, cross-cultural, gender and ethical
      considerations.

      Candidates may evaluate a smaller number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate depth
      of knowledge, or may evaluate a larger number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate
      breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on
      the quality of the evaluation presented.

      If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
      maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for
      criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A, knowledge and
      comprehension.

13.   Evaluate psychological research (theories and/or studies) related to goal-setting in the
      motivation of individuals involved in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of psychological research
      related to goal-setting in the motivation of individuals by weighing up strengths and limitations of
      the research. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to
      be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

      If candidates discuss two theories they are not required to include studies to back up their argument.

      Candidates could make reference to theories such as:
       achievement goal theory
       self-efficacy
       intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation.

      Studies related to goal-setting in the motivation of individuals could include, but are not limited to:
       Duda and Hall (2001) related to achievement goals on performance
       Elliot and Dweck (1988) on “ego-orientation”
       Duda et al. (1988) on the relationship between goals perspective and perception of success.

      Evaluation could include cultural, gender and methodological consideration relevant to the chosen
      research. The major focus of the response should be on an evaluation of research, rather than a
      descriptive overview of goal-setting in the motivation of individuals.

      Candidates may evaluate a smaller number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate depth
      of knowledge, or may evaluate a larger number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate
      breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on
      the quality of the evaluation presented.

      If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
      maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for
      criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A, knowledge and
      comprehension.

14.   Discuss reasons for using drugs in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments or factors as to why people use drugs in sport. Conclusions should
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Reasons for using drugs in sport include, but are not limited to:
       improvement of performance
       prolonging career in sport
       more rapid recovery from injury
       stress reduction.

      The question is specifically asking about reasons for using drugs in sport. Discussion of addiction
      or drug abuse is not the focus of the question. Candidates may address both illicit and non-illicit
      use of drugs in sport and this could include blood doping in sport.

      Candidates may discuss a smaller number of reasons in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or
      may discuss a larger number of reasons in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
      Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on the quality of the
      discussion presented.

15.   To what extent do cognitive factors influence behaviour in sport?

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits of arguments in
      relation to how cognitive factors influence behaviour in sport. Candidates may argue the extent of
      this influence by also addressing the influence of biological and/or sociocultural factors on
      behaviour in sport. In addition biological and/or sociocultural factors may be legitimately
      considered if they are shown to influence, or be influenced by, cognitive factors. However, answers
      should be supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument and the conclusion should
      clearly indicate the extent to which cognitive factors influence behaviour in sports.

      Responses could address individual behaviour or team behaviour in sport. Cognitive factors could
      include, but are not limited to, theories related to cognitive functioning and various strategies used
      to build skills and mental strength, such as:
       self-efficacy
       mental toughness
       hardiness
       social identity
       team cohesion
       patterns of attribution
       mental imagery.

      Biological and sociocultural factors may be legitimately considered if they are shown to influence,
      or be influenced by, cognitive factors.

      Candidates may consider a smaller number of cognitive factors in order to demonstrate depth of
      knowledge, or a larger number of cognitive factors in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
      Both approaches are equally acceptable. Marks should be awarded based on the quality of
      the consideration.
