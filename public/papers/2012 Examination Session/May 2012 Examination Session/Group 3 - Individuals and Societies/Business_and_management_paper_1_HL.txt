                                               SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    As part of his evaluation of Option 3 (lines 153–157), Kos Palouk consulted Sami Taibi, who owned
      and operated a medium-sized grocery store. Sami said that Beral had no reliable produce suppliers and
      there was a business opportunity if someone could make reliability their unique selling point (USP).
      However, the deterioration of the situation outside of the UWP-protected area was making reliable
      purchase and distribution of produce difficult (Item 1).

      To ensure reliability, Kos would require a loan of $42 000 to:
       Purchase two lorries (2 at $15 000 = $30 000). Because of the poor quality of the roads, the lorries
         would require frequent maintenance. One lorry could still deliver produce while the other was
         being maintained.
       Increase working capital ($12 000) for higher stock levels.

      Unfortunately, the bank will loan Kos a maximum of $30 000, as they do not wish to loan funds for
      working capital as well as for the purchase of the lorries (Item 2).

      Kos had an idea. He proposed to Sami that they merge his grocery store with Kos’ wholesale
      produce business. The combined operation would be organized as a private limited company and
      Kos proposed a 50-50 share ownership. It would also have the following advantages:
       It would have two revenue streams: wholesale (from Kos’ operations) and retail (from Sami’s
         grocery store).
       The grocery store would acquire produce at wholesale prices.
       The combined operation would always guarantee supply to the grocery store before other customers.

      However Sami was reluctant to give up 50 % ownership of his grocery store for an unproven
      operation. Sami made a different proposal: Kos would merge his wholesale operation into
      Sami’s grocery store in exchange for 25 % of the shares of the new private limited company.
      The merger would also result in a new contract and management structure (Items 3 and 4).



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 5 continued)

      (a)   Identify two advantages to Kos Palouk of merging his wholesale produce
            business with Sami Taibi’s grocery store.                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two advantages to Sami Taibi and Kos Palouk of organizing the new
            (merged) business as a private limited company.                                      [4 marks]

      (c)   Calculate:

		          (i)    the annual depreciation expense of one $15 000 lorry with a useful life of
                   7 years and a residual value of $1000 using the straight line method.         [1 mark]

		          (ii)   the depreciation expense in the second year of one $15 000 lorry using
                   the reducing balance method, with a depreciation rate of 32 % (show all
                   your working).                                                                [2 marks]

      (d)   Using Vroom’s expectancy theory of motivation, or any other motivation
            theories, examine Sami Taibi’s proposal.                                             [9 marks]

      (e)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 4, advise
            Kos Palouk on Sami Taibi’s proposal.                                                [12 marks]

Additional Information

Item 1: Extract from Beral Courier, a local newspaper

Rumours of increased violence outside the UWP-protected area were recently confirmed by the office
of the local governor. Attacks against vehicles on roads near Bosca, Boussena, Saura and Gana have
been confirmed by local police.   One driver, who was returning from Saura, was seriously injured.  
In another instance, there was severe damage to a road, causing vehicles to take a different route, which
doubled the travel time. The local governor announced an increase in police patrols in the area.

The impact of the increased violence has had an immediate impact on local Beral shops, which reported
shortages of produce.


Item 2: Bank loan offer to Kos

Loan amount:                 $30 000
Interest rate:               8 % (fixed)
Repayment schedule:          7 years, payments monthly
Monthly payment amount:      $475 (principal and interest)
Collateral:                  all assets of business, including the two lorries,
                             and Kos’ personal residence


Item 3: Sami’s proposal for a new contract

3.1: At start of new (merged) business

Kos’ ownership:       25 %
Sami’s ownership:     75 %

Kos’ monthly salary: $650
If there are dividends, Kos would receive 25 % of the dividends.

The new private limited company would take out the $30 000 bank loan. Sami’s grocery store would
provide the additional $12 000.

3.2: Potential change in ownership structure

Sami has set Kos a target of annual sales of $96 000 ($8000 per month on average) for the wholesale
operation for 2 consecutive years (this figure would not include “sales” to Sami’s grocery store).
 If the wholesale operation did not reach the annual sales target for 2 consecutive years within
  7 years (the duration of the loan), Kos would remain a 25 % owner with his original salary of $650 per
  month (no change in ownership structure).
 If the wholesale operation meets the two-year performance target, Kos would receive an additional
  24 % ownership in the private limited company. His salary would be adjusted so that it was always
  equal to 96 % of Sami’s salary. He would also be entitled to 49 % of any dividends.

Item 4: Management structure if Sami’s proposal is implemented


                                    New (merged) business:
                                      General manager
