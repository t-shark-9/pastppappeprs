                             EU court rules minimum price for cigarettes illegal

           The European Court of Justice has ruled that Ireland cannot impose a minimum price
            on cigarettes. It said that member countries would have to find other ways to combat smoking.
            This could be achieved by increasing indirect tax on tobacco, but imposing a minimum price
            would distort fair competition in the market. The ruling is designed to maintain the freedom of
            manufacturers and importers to benefit from lower costs and greater efficiency.

           The judgment said the aim of ensuring that tobacco prices are high can be “adequately” achieved
            by increasing tax, since any indirect tax rises are, sooner or later, reflected in an increased
            retail price, without removing the freedom of manufacturers to set prices.

           The Irish government had claimed that it needed to fix a high minimum price to discourage
            smoking. This followed government legislation to ban tobacco advertising and promotion
            in July 2009. According to a spokesperson from the anti-smoking group ASH (Action on
            Smoking and Health), this measure helped to prevent retail outlets from making young people
            feel attracted to buying cigarettes. “Close to 30 % of our population still smoke and 7000 die
            from tobacco-related disease each year,” he said.

           It has been argued that increasing the price of cigarettes is one of the most effective ways of
            curbing harmful smoking and there is a need to make cigarettes less appealing, particularly to
            young people. The evidence is that banning advertising, introducing minimum pricing and
            increasing health warnings can all work.

           The head of a major retail organization has attacked the idea of minimum pricing
            for cigarettes. He argued that artificially fixing a minimum price would not be effective.
            Also, since the demand for tobacco is inelastic, raising the price would not work.
            Moreover, it was against the free market for a government to set prices for any product available
            to consumers, limiting their freedom to choose.

                                                       Eurozone debt crisis

           A debt crisis in Europe has caused financial markets to watch government plans to deal with
            the issue of rising government debt.

           Governments have borrowed heavily to bring the 16 nation eurozone* out of its first recession
            and debt levels are expected to be well above the European Union (EU) limit of 60 % of
            gross domestic product (GDP). Average eurozone government debt could reach 84 % of GDP
            in 2010. Germany, long considered a model of fiscal discipline, forecasts government debt at
            around 78 % of GDP in 2010 while, in Greece, government debt of 120 % of GDP is expected.

           The combination of larger budget deficits, low economic growth and support for the banking
            sector has caused higher public debt levels. Eurozone governments have been urged to
            reduce debt. The increase in debt is raising the cost of borrowing for many countries and adding
            to the cost of repayments in future budgets.

           With unemployment rising and weak growth expected in 2010, officials cannot count
            on increased tax revenues for much help in paying off debt, much of which is owed to
            other countries. Possible policy solutions include cutting welfare spending or raising the
            retirement age to reduce future government costs. Alternatively, the member countries
            of the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may need to give money to the countries
            in danger of default.

           The debt crisis is limiting government finances and potential growth. Government revenue
            will be further limited by an aging population that will need expensive health care in the
            years to come. Many countries have pledged to tighten fiscal and monetary policies.
            However, this may damage an economic recovery.

           Failing to act on the deficits and debt may, however, spark a negative reaction from financial
            markets that will demand higher interest payments on loans. The Prime Minister of Greece
            has warned: “Either we eradicate the debt, or the debt will eliminate the country”.

                                             Micro-credit conflict of interest

           The idea of giving small loans to poor people, especially women, was hailed as the key to
            achieving economic development for even the poorest citizens. Muhammad Yunus,
            the economist who pioneered the practice by lending small amounts to basket weavers
            in Bangladesh, won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.

           The practice has grown so popular, helping establish small businesses such as tailors and
            hairdressers, that some are now concerned over the direction it has taken. Attracted by the
            prospect of profits from even the smallest of loans, some banks now dominate micro-credit,
            with some charging interest rates of over 100 %.

           The key question facing the industry remains how much money investors should make from
            lending to poor people, mostly women, often at hidden interest rates. “Micro-credit should
            be seen as an opportunity to help people out of poverty, not as an opportunity to make money
            out of poor people,” Yunus said. “Interest rates should be 10 to 15 % above the cost of raising
            the money and anything beyond that is exploitation. Most micro-credit lenders would fail
            this test.”

           How much interest and profit are acceptable and what constitutes exploitation? The interest
            rates that draw the most concern include those in Nigeria and Mexico, where the demand for
            small loans from a large population cannot be met by existing lenders. One Mexican lender
            charges an annual rate of 125 %. The average in Mexico is about 70 %, compared with a global
            average of about 37 % in interest and fees.

           There is debate over whether micro-credit loans actually lift people out of poverty.
            Some researchers conclude that not every poor person is an entrepreneur in waiting but the
            loans do help relieve some of the worst aspects of poverty.

           The micro-credit industry has outgrown its charitable beginning. Despite a promise to put the
            money back into development, analysts say the high interest rates and healthy profits of the
            largest micro-credit institutions pushed up interest rates across Mexico.
