In addition to the assessment criteria, use the paper-specific markscheme below. Award up to the
maximum marks indicated. Each question is worth [10 marks].

1.       Using the concept of market failure, explain why a government may try to decrease the use of
         motor vehicles in city centres.
         Candidates may include:
          a definition of market failure
          a definition of negative externalities, consumption or production
          an explanation that this is a case of a negative consumption externality (private use of vehicles)
           or production externality (commercial use of vehicles) leading to over-use of motor-vehicles
          MSB less than MPB for consumption externality or MSC greater than MPC for production
           externality
          an explanation of the external costs, e.g. effects on third parties due to congestion or pollution,
           increase in business costs
          use of a diagram to illustrate the MSB curve lying below the MPB curve or the MPC curve lying
           below the MSC curve
          an explanation of the impact of negative externalities in terms of inefficient use of scarce
           resources/over-allocation of resources.
         References to methods of reducing use of motor vehicles may be rewarded.
         Candidates may be awarded full marks through either the MSB/MPB approach or the MSC/MPC
         approach.
         Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.
         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.

6.   Explain three factors which may limit the effectiveness of aid as a means of promoting
     economic development.

     Candidates may include:
      a definition of aid
      a definition of economic development
      examples of types of aid
      an explanation of factors:
       – problems associated with tied aid
       – misuse of aid revenues
       – much aid is in the form of soft loans which have to be repaid giving rise to indebtedness
       – conditionality and influence on the policies of the recipient government
       – aid which discourages self-reliance
       – food aid which discourages domestic production
       – aid motivated by political interests of donors.

     If only one factor is explained candidates cannot be awarded more than [4 marks]. If only two
     factors are explained candidates cannot be awarded more than [7 marks].

     Candidates who argue that the effectives of aid will be limited by those factors which limit
     development in general, e.g. poor infrastructure, unequal distribution of income should be
     rewarded.

     Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
     should be rewarded.
