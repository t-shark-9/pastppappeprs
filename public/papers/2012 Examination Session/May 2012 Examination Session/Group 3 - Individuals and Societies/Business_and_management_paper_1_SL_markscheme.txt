                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   General Ron Meiri was autocratic (lines 8–9). Identify four key features of
           an autocratic leadership style.                                             [4 marks]

           An autocratic leadership style has features such as:
            the leader wants to hold on to as much power, authority and control as possible
            the leader does not delegate
            employees are not involved in consultation
            employees are just expected to obey
            accept any other relevant feature.


           N.B. Answers about organizational structure (centralized, tall) are not directly
           relevant and should not be credited.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct feature identified, up to a maximum of [4 marks].

     (b)   “The organizational structure of the UWP Mission was tall” (lines 9–10).
           Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of this type of structure.    [4 marks]

           A tall organizational structure has the following advantages:
            hierarchies and managerial chains of command are clear and unambiguous
            roles, posts and departments tend to be highly specialized
            rules and procedures are written and formalized
            the working environment is often very stable
            accept any other relevant advantage.

           A tall organizational structure has the following disadvantages:
            it may appear impersonal, overly administrative and bureaucratic
            decision-making can be slow and centralized
            employees are not encouraged to participate or share their views
            responding to changes in the internal or external environment can be slow
            accept any other relevant disadvantage.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct advantage/disadvantage identified, and [1 mark]
           for the appropriate explanation of that advantage/disadvantage up to a maximum
           of [2 marks].
                                                    –6–             M12/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




     (c)   Analyse the appropriateness of a bank loan as a source of finance for
           Kos Palouk’s new lorry (lines 129–130).                               [7 marks]

           The bank loan is appropriate because it is a well-established method of external
           funding to buy fixed assets such as machinery or property. In Loyka, Kos may
           not have access to other sources of external funding such as venture capitalists.
           Moreover, due to the small size of his part-time business and the fact that he can
           only save $100 a month before tax (Appendix 5), he probably does not have
           enough savings or retained profit for internal funding.

           However, the bank loan may not be appropriate because Kos would have to pay
           interest, even if he is not very successful at the start. Besides, the bank manager
           requires the lorry as collateral: this means that one day Kos could lose his lorry if
           he does not keep up with repayments, which is vital for the business, even if he
           has paid back some of the loan.

           N.B.
            Candidates may refer to other sources of finance (such as leasing); this is an
             acceptable way to analyse the appopriateness of the bank loan, as opposed to
             other sources of finance. This should be credited.
            As in all answers, correct use of subject terminology (e.g. about retained profit)
             should be credited.
            Candidates are not required to make any recommendation at the end; the ones
             who do so will not receive extra marks, as the command term is “analyse” and
             not “recommend”.

           Accept any other relevant analysis.


           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.


2.   (a)   Loyka’s economy is mainly in the primary sector (line 1). Briefly describe
           the nature of business activity in this sector.                            [2 marks]

           The primary sector of an economy includes agriculture as well as fishing, forestry
           and mining. It converts natural resources into primary products.

           Accept any other relevant description.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct element of the description up to a maximum of
           [2 marks].

(b)   Outline one reason why Kos Palouk does not need to do any additional
      marketing at the UWP Mission.                                        [2 marks]

      Kos does not need to do any additional marketing at the UWP Mission because he
      is already known there: he already has an established base of customers who trust
      him (customer loyalty) and will be ready to buy more produce from him.

      Accept any other relevant answer.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic outline that shows some knowledge and
      understanding.

      Award [2 marks] for a clear outline that shows clear knowledge and
      understanding.

(c)   Using information from Appendix 5a,

      (i)    calculate the net profit margin and the gross profit margin for
             Kos Palouk from his current operation (Option 1).                            [2 marks]

      (ii)   calculate the net profit margin and the gross profit margin for
             Kos Palouk from his forecast operation (Option 2).              [2 marks]

                                     4000


             Award [1 mark] for each correct answer, up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            –8–              M12/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




(d)   Interpret your results from part (c) and the data from Appendix 5a and 5b.            [7 marks]

      The calculations show that the net profit margin for the forecast operation
      increases by 2.5% and the gross profit margin increases by 5%
      (from 50% to 55%).

      For the forecast operation (Option 2), gas and vehicle maintenance are eight
      times higher ($400 as opposed to $50) as it involves more driving, and there is a
      new type of expense (rent of storage facility for $200 per month), however Kos
      can multiply his sales by ten (from $400 to $4000) and realize economies of scale.
      The forecast operation also means that he would multiply his income more than
      twice (from $650 to $1500, see Appendix 5b). As he needs $550 to support
      himself and his family, he currently saves $100 every month (before tax).
      With the forecast operation, if he expands, he could save over $900 a month
      ( $1500  $550  $950 ) though not all of it would be personal savings as he would
      need to pay back the bank loan (currently $100 interest a month) and any tax
      (he is likely to pay more taxes).

      The profitability ratios overall show that Kos’ operations (the current one as well
      as the forecast one) are financially healthy, however the forecast one (Option 2)
      shows a slightly higher margin (for both net and gross profit), which could
      support the choice for that option.

      Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

      Accept any other relevant answer.

3.   (a)   Kos Palouk prepared a business plan (line 142). Identify four elements of a
           business plan.                                                              [4 marks]

           Business plans usually include the following elements:
            mission statement and/or vision statement (count as one answer)
            aims / objectives / strategic objectives (count as one answer)
            information about the business environment (industry, competitors),
             PEST analysis (count as one answer)
            description of operations
            marketing plan / marketing strategy / marketing intelligence (count as one
             answer)

            financial statements / cash-flow forecast / start-up costs (count as one answer)
            accept any other relevant element.


           N.B. The list above is not exhaustive.
            Do not award a mark for “appendices” or “table of contents” or “executive
             summary”.
            Do not award a mark for just “SWOT analysis”.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct element up to a maximum of [4 marks].

     (b)   With reference to Kos Palouk’s business, distinguish between just-in-time
           and just-in-case stock control (lines 136–138).                           [4 marks]

           Just-in-time (JIT) stock control means that Kos was only buying stock
           (fresh produce) from suppliers (farmers) when required, for example when he had
           particular orders from the UWP Mission. This was a good way for him to avoid
           storage and wastage.

           Just-in-case (JIC) stock control means that Kos would need to buy produce and
           keep a reserve (the buffer stock); he would need to store the produce, which is
           why he would require a storage facility with a refrigerated room for the eggs,
           vegetables and poultry. With just-in-case stock control, Kos would be ready to
           deliver larger amounts of produce to the new university or hospital, whenever
           required.

           Accept any other relevant answer.

      [1 to 2 marks]
      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some knowledge of stock control
      methods. Award [2 marks] for an answer that refers to the difference between
      just-in-time and just-in-case stock control at a generic, theoretical level.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      Award [3 marks] for an answer that combines “theory” (i.e. definitions) and
      “practice” (i.e. reference to the case study). Award [4 marks] for an answer that
      fully and clearly distinguishes between just-in-time and just-in-case stock control
      with reference to Kos Palouk’s business.

(c)   Analyse the value of the social and environmental audit (line 96) for both
      General Diane Pierce and the local community.                              [7 marks]

      The results of the formal social and environmental audit of the construction of
      both facilities will enable General Diane Pierce to assess the relative impacts of
      the two proposed facilities (university vs hospital) and to make a more informed
      decision. Some of the results of the audit will probably be positive in the short
      term (e.g. by increasing access to medical sources straightway) and in the long
      term (e.g. by training the next generation of Loykese engineers, teachers
      and nurses), but some others may be negative (e.g. the destruction of the botanical
      gardens).

      The audit will also be of value for the local community as it represents a channel
      to express their views, either to express approval (e.g. as there is a lack of doctors
      in Loyka) or disapproval (e.g. about the issue of foreign male doctors looking
      after local female patients). Audits make it possible to go beyond the anecdotal
      (e.g. the earlier conflicts between the local governor and General Ron Meiri) and
      to have a more holistic, objective view with recommendations.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      N.B. candidates may not refer much to environmental aspects; this is acceptable
      as there is little in the case study about that. There is no expectation that
      candidates will cover social and environmental aspects to the same extent, as the
      focus here is on social impacts.

4.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    span of control (lines 10–11)                                                  [2 marks]

                  Span of control refers to the number of subordinates under a single line
                  manager. When a manager has many subordinates reporting directly to
                  him/her there is a “wide” span of control, and a “narrow” span when there
                  are few.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

           (ii)   primary research (line 97).                                                [2 marks]

                  The aim of primary research is to create data that does not already exist.
                  Primary research is carried out (first-hand) by the researcher (for example
                  through interviews or surveys); data is collected for a specific purpose, as
                  opposed to secondary research which means re-using and analysing data
                  already collected by someone else, for another purpose.


                  N.B. Just writing “surveys and focus groups” is not enough for [1 mark].

                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

(b)   Prepare a SWOT analysis of Kos Palouk’s current produce distribution
      business (with no changes) showing only the strengths and weaknesses. [4 marks]

      The strengths of his current produce distribution business include the following:
       he has a network of reliable suppliers (local farms)
       he has an established reputation at the UWP Mission where he has good
        contacts (such as Colonel Michael Donovan) and good customers (the troops)
       his just-in-time (JIT) stock control system ensures fresh produce,
        avoiding wastage
       his business model is simple yet effective (he has a gross profit of $200
        a month)
       accept any other relevant strength.

      The weaknesses of his current produce distribution business include the following:
       he is a sole trader with no employee, so if ever he is ill and cannot work, he has
        nobody to cover for him
       he has limited capital (working capital) and limited resources
       he is very dependent on his car: what would he do if it breaks down?
       he is overly dependent on one large customer (UWP)
       his current business is so small that there is no scope for economy of scale
       accept any other relevant weakness.


      N.B.
       Do not credit external factors (such as the opportunity for expansion coming
        from the UWP Mission’s development of a new facility, or the threat coming
        from road attacks); the strengths and weaknesses must be internal and must
        refer to the current operation.
       To receive a mark, each point must be clear, precise and without any
        ambiguity.

      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct strength, up to a maximum of [2 marks], and
      [1 mark] for each correct weakness, up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Explain two social factors that could influence General Diane Pierce’s
      decision regarding the construction project.                           [4 marks]
      The following social factors could influence General Diane Pierce:
       current decline in healthcare
       the need for education, especially in a forward-looking sustainable way
        (by training professionals such as teachers, nurses, doctors and engineers)
       the relative poverty of a developing country that relies mainly on the primary
        sector
       the social values and cultural attitudes of the local community (the Loykese)
        towards: foreigners, the UWP Mission or the construction project itself
       accept any other relevant social factor.
      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Mark as 2+2.
      Award [1 mark] for each correct factor identified, and [1 mark]
      for an appropriate explanation of that factor (how can it influence
      General Diane Pierce’s decision).

(d)   With reference to the UWP Mission to Loyka when General Diane Pierce
      arrived, discuss the relationship between aims, strategic objectives and
      operational objectives.                                                  [8 marks]
      Aims refer to long-term goals which are often formulated in a generic way
      (thereby comparable to the vision statement of an organization); the aim of the
      UWP Mission is “to maintain order, peace and security”. Strategic objectives are
      more specific: General Diane Pierce’s strategic objective is “to improve the image
      of ‘the Olive Hats’”. Such objectives have a long-term dimension, but they can be
      more easily measured. They need to be broken down into tactical objectives with
      specific targets and timelines to make it possible to assess if/when they have been
      reached. Operational objectives are more precise and refer to day-to-day
      activities. The main operational objective for General Diane Pierce is to
      remotivate her troops.

      There is a hierarchy of objectives (from aims to strategic objectives to
      operational objectives), however the vocabulary of strategy relies heavily on
      semantic distinctions that successful organizations do not always follow;
      some organizations also have corporate objectives, departmental objectives, team
      objectives etc.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      N.B. Do not credit the elements of an answer that only copy the case study:
      quotes may be useful, but they must be integrated into the discussion.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
