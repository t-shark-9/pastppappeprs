1.       (a)   Explain the possible economic advantages to consumers that arise from
               living in a free market economy.                                              [10 marks]

               Answers should include:
                a definition of a free market economy
                an explanation of reliance on price to allocate goods and services
                an explanation of reliance on supply and demand to set prices and wages
                consumers enjoy an absence of shortages and surpluses in markets
                consumers enjoy choice and a wide range of goods and services
                producers respond to the wishes of consumers via price signals
                consumers enjoy lower prices due to competition.

               Answers may include:
                use of a demand/supply diagram indicating a change in resource allocation
                profit motive allows producers to respond quickly to changes in consumer
                 tastes
                reference to Adam Smith and the self-regulating nature of markets
                consumers can participate in private ownership of the means of production
                consumers may benefit from competition between firms
                consumers enjoy relative efficiency.

               Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach

           Answers may include:
            use of AD/AS diagram to illustrate expenditure reducing
            use of tariff diagram to illustrate expenditure switching
            expenditure-switching policies may reduce imports only but expenditure-
             reducing policies may affect demand for all goods and services,
             reducing AD
            expenditure-switching policies may cause conflict with trade blocs and
             international organisations
            expenditure-switching policies may cause imported inflation and trade wars
            expenditure-reducing policies may damage growth and employment and
             may lead towards a recession
            expenditure-reducing policies may improve export competitiveness due to
             their deflationary nature.

(b)   Evaluate the view that it is never desirable for countries to resort to
      protectionism.                                                                   [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
       a definition of protectionism
       an explanation of types of protectionism
       arguments in support of the view in terms of the case for free trade
        – greater volume of trade
        – benefits of specialisation (specific reference to absolute and comparative
           advantage is not required in SL)
        – more efficiency in the allocation of resources
        – greater employment
        – greater choice
        – lower prices for consumers
       arguments in support of the view in terms of the case against protectionism
        – the possibility of retaliation
        – misallocation of resources
        – higher prices
       use of a tariff diagram to illustrate the costs of protectionism
       arguments against the view in terms of the drawbacks of free trade
        – the problem of free trade between unequal partners
        – impact on LDCs’ efforts to diversify
       arguments against the view in terms of specific justifications of
        protectionism
        – infant industry argument
        – employment arguments
        – protection of the balance of payments
        – source of government revenue
        – anti-dumping
        – strategic arguments
       reference to short-term/long-term effects of protectionism
       evaluation of above arguments.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

4.   (a)   Explain how three of the following factors may act as barriers to
           development in a less developed country:

              capital flight
              income inequality
              ineffective taxation structure
              lack of infrastructure.                                                          [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
            a definition of development
            a definition of a less developed country
            a definition of each of the three economic factors selected
            an explanation of how the three chosen economic factors act as barriers:
             – capital flight: reduces the amount of aid/FDI that remains in the less
                developed country, reducing investment
             – income inequality: adversely affects the purchasing power and prevents
                the less affluent from saving and realising their economic potential
             – ineffective taxation structure: prevents the government from maximising
                its potential tax revenue thus limiting the funds available for public
                spending
             – lack of infrastructure – raises the costs, and limits the extent of, all forms
                of economic activity.

           Answers may include:
            interrelationships between the barriers may reinforce them
            diagrams such as the Lorenz curve to illustrate income inequality
            mention of human as well as physical capital under infrastructure.

(b)   Evaluate the view that foreign direct investment (FDI) is the key factor in
      determining whether a developing country will be able to achieve
      economic growth and development.                                                 [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
       a definition of foreign direct investment (FDI)
       a definition of economic growth
       a definition of economic development
       arguments for FDI: MNCs can fill the savings gap through local investment,
        can generate export revenues, can generate tax revenues, can boost
        employment, can improve education and training, but all to a variable extent
       arguments against FDI: MNC profits may be repatriated elsewhere, tax
        concessions may have to be made (reducing revenues), inappropriate
        technology may generate little local employment, employment may be for
        the unskilled only, pressure may be put on government to allow policies
        favourable to development such as environmental shortcuts
       alternative paths to development, e.g. inward-oriented growth,
        micro-finance
       case studies of particular FDI show it is not always successful in promoting
        economic growth and development
       evaluation of above arguments.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
