                                                 SECTION A

Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Implementation of a school database

      Golden Sylvie School needs to be able to manage information such as students’ personal details,
      health details, grades, parents’ contact details and financial statements. To solve this management
      problem the school has purchased a relational database application.

      One purpose of this database is to keep a record of students’ visits to the school nurse. This part of
      the relational database is illustrated below.




      (a)   (i)    State the name of the primary key field of the table tblVisit.                        [1]

		          (ii)   State the relationship between the tables tblNurse and tblVisit.                      [1]

		          (iii) State a field type that would be suitable for Surname in the table tblStudent.         [1]

		          (iv) State a field type that would be suitable for Salary in the table tblNurse.             [1]

		          (v)    State a field type that would be suitable for Sent_Home? in the table tblVisit.       [1]

		          (vi) State a field type that would be suitable for Telephone_Number in the table tblNurse.   [1]




                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      (b)   (i)    The database will allow teachers to export data to a spreadsheet.

			                Explain one reason why teachers would export data from the database to
                   a spreadsheet.                                                                      [2]

		          (ii)   The new database will also require teachers to undertake training to be able to
                   use it.

			                A local company is offering to train users in the use of the new system.
			                The two options proposed are:
                   • online training
                   • face-to-face training.

			                Contrast the two options.                                                           [4]

      (c)   The following screen shows the options this database will have in its online version.




                                               [Used with permission.]


		          When the system was purchased it was possible to include a Virtual Private Network
            (VPN), giving remote access to teachers to this database, which is held on the
            school’s server.

		          Discuss the impact for the school of the decision to allow teachers remote access to the
            school server.                                                                             [8]

2.    Telemedicine

      Many countries are increasing their use of telemedicine as a method of providing healthcare in remote
      locations. To transfer the data from a remote location to a hospital, two methods may be used:
      real-time or store and forward. Store and forward is a technique common in messaging services.
      Data is sent from one device to a receiving device, but first it passes through an exchange server,
      such as an email server. It may take 24 to 48 hours for the message to be received.




     [Source: http://historiadelatelemedicinaschirlysuarez.blogspot.com/2010/09/importancia-de-la-telemedicina.html, 17 June 2011]


      (a)    (i)     Define the term real-time communication.                                                                        [2]

		           (ii)    After an accident an image of an x-ray of a badly broken leg was taken in bitmap
                     format. To ensure the resolution was clear/high enough for a doctor to see the
                     extent of the injuries, the image size was 12 MB (Megabyte). The connection the
                     doctor will be using has a speed of 240 kb/s (kilobit per second).

			                  Calculate how long it will take to download the image of the x-ray. (Show your
                     working.)                                                                                                       [2]

		           (iii) In some cases the technology available in the remote locations will not allow for
                   large images to be sent to the hospital.

			                  Identify two methods to resolve this problem.                                                                   [2]

(Question 2 continued)

      (b)   (i)    Explain one situation in telemedicine that is better suited to real-time data
                   transfer and one situation in telemedicine that is better suited to store and forward
                   data transfer.                                                                          [4]

		          (ii)   Many mobile devices use store and forward to manage data transfer.

			                Explain one reason for using store and forward by such devices.                         [2]

      (c)   In many countries doctors are using videoconferencing to treat patients remotely.
            Evaluate this medical practice.                                                                [8]

3.    Improving Lima’s transport system

      Lima has been promoting a new transport system which has been designed to make it easier to travel
      from one side of the city to the other. However, the transport system has not worked as well as
      expected and citizens of Lima have used social networking websites such as Facebook and YouTube
      to report problems, such as extreme delays between buses, or a road accident.




                                            [Used with permission.]


      (a)   (i)    Describe what is meant by social networking.                                          [2]

		          (ii)   Different types of files can be uploaded to highlight the traffic problems
                   described above.

			Describe two appropriate types of files which could be uploaded and how they
   highlight the problem.                                                                                [4]

(Question 3 continued)

      (b)   Some managers of local businesses have realized that social networking may provide new
            business opportunities and have created company webpages on Facebook.

		          Explain why companies will use social networking websites to develop new business
            opportunities.                                                                                  [6]

      (c)   Although the Facebook page reporting system is not managed by the Lima authorities,
            they are using it to solve the transport problems that happen in the city of Lima.

		          The Lima authorities are considering implementing an official website for reporting
            transport problems.

		          To what extent is a social networking website preferable to an official website for reporting
            transport problems?                                                                             [8]

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.    University IT support

      The University of Passmore has five faculties which between them contain over fifty departments.
      All of them make extensive use of computer facilities and require effective IT support.
      This is provided by an information services department. Its role is to provide:
      • 24 hour access to IT data centres
      • full access to library services
      • support for student access to the broadband network through the student halls of residence, and for
         wireless networks across all the campuses
      • support for university staff access to networked systems and services
      • web-based information resources (e-journals and e-books) and services for learning, teaching
         and research
      • management and development of a virtual learning environment for the university
      • central IT support for management information systems governing financial, personnel and
         student records functions.

      In addition to this, many departments also want their own specific facilities. For example,
      the computer science department needs access to compilers, and the performing arts department
      needs a wide range of video and music editing capability.

      As with any organization, interruptions to IT services can be hugely inconvenient and also costly.

      The information services department ensures that essential services are maintained and incidents that
      may lead to an interruption of services are dealt with at all times.

      When a user reports an incident, the IT support staff have to log the incident and then make decisions
      about the course of action to be taken.

      Procedures have been developed so that incidents are responded to in the most timely and cost
      effective way possible.



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 4 continued)

      (a)   The information services department employs:
            • information system managers
            • programmers
            • IT support staff.

		          (i)    Identify two specific tasks that the information system managers must perform.        [2]

		          (ii)   Identify two specific tasks that the programmers must perform.                        [2]

		          (iii) Identify two specific tasks that the IT support staff must perform.                    [2]

      (b)   When a user reports an incident, the IT support staff have to create a log of the incident
            and then make decisions about the course of action to be taken.

		          The information services department needs to classify incidents as major or minor.
            Explain three criteria that the information services department could use to reach
            this decision.                                                                               [6]




      (c)   The computer science department wants to run its computers using a different network
            operating system to that used by the rest of the university.

		          To what extent should it be the responsibility of the information services department to
            provide support for this?                                                                    [8]

5.      Daffodil Hotels

        Daffodil Hotels is a chain of five hotels that currently uses an old text-based computer system to
        store and process bookings. Its management has decided that it needs to change to a more up-to-date
        and user-friendly system that also has online booking and other useful services.

        Daffodil Hotels approached a software development company that has already produced systems for
        other hotel chains. Some modifications would be necessary in order to suit the particular requirements
        of Daffodil Hotels.

        The management of Daffodil Hotels has designated its current IT manager to act as project manager
        for the commissioning and installation of the new system. The project manager has a meeting with
        the suppliers in order to draw up a software requirements specification.

        (a)      (i)     Identify two overall responsibilities of a project manager.                                                                       [2]

		               (ii)    Identify four features that might be part of a software requirements specification.                                               [4]

        (b)      During discussions with the developers, prototypes are frequently used.

		               Explain how the use of prototypes can assist in the development of a software product
                 that is acceptable to the client.                                                                                                         [6]

        (c)      The project manager used the waterfall method of systems development in order to draw
                 up the project plan shown in the Gantt chart below.

                                                         Sep 11                    Oct 11                  Nov 11               Dec 11                     Jan

		               The changeover did not go according to plan. When the software was ready to be installed,
                 many serious problems occurred, leading to a failure to deliver the required specification.

		               With reference to the Gantt chart and other examples you have studied, to what extent is
                 the project plan adequate as the basis for this software changeover?                                                                      [8]

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

6.    Fuzzy logic

      Computers work with binary logic. They are good at making decisions based on whether a condition
      is true or false. Real life is not like that. A glass can be empty or full. It can also be 0.3 (30 %) full
      or we might say that it is partly full.

      With fuzzy logic we can produce computer systems that work better than those based on pure
      binary logic. In fuzzy systems, values are indicated by a number (called a truth value) in the range
      from 0 to 1, where 0 represents absolute falseness and 1 represents absolute truth. A piece of washing
      might be completely clean (0) or completely dirty (1). However, in some cases it might be slightly
      dirty (0.4).

      (a)   Some washing machines can examine the washing and can add or reduce time to the
            washing cycle, based on factors such as the hardness of the water in the washing.
            This gives more precise control over the washing conditions, thereby saving time, water
            and energy.

		          (i)    Identify two data items, in addition to the hardness of the water, that must be
                   measured in order to make a suitable decision about washing time.                        [2]

		          (ii)   Identify four steps that the washing machine software must take in order to adjust
                   the length of the washing cycle correctly.                                               [4]

      (b)   A bank is considering introducing new IT systems to support the processing of customers’
            accounts. Two cases where these systems would be applied are:
            • processing customers’ monthly bank statements
            • detecting fraudulent bank transactions.

		          Contrast the suitability of using fuzzy logic in these two cases.                               [6]

      (c)   Computer systems are being developed based on fuzzy logic to predict market trends
            for investors.

		          To what extent is it sensible for an investor to trust such systems instead of his
            own judgment?                                                                                   [8]

7.    Expert car repairs

      Many cars display a “check engine” light on the dashboard.


                                    CHECK
            CHECK
                                    ENGINE




                           [Photo from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vw_engine_check.jpg]



      This means that the vehicle’s engine control unit (ECU) has determined that either a component has
      failed or the emission control system is not working properly.

      When the light comes on, one or more diagnostic trouble codes (DTC), e.g. P0071 and P0076, are
      stored in the engine control module.

      In order to solve one of these problems, a car mechanic retrieves the DTCs and the appropriate
      troubleshooting information from the expert system is followed in order to determine the problem.



                                                                   (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 7 continued)

      (a)   (i)    Sensors are used to provide data to show that the emission control system is not
                   working properly.

			                Identify two sensors that could provide this data.                                      [2]

		          (ii)   Many cars have a traction control system to prevent the wheels from spinning if the
                   accelerator is pressed too hard. This is controlled by the engine control unit (ECU).

			                Identify four different ways in which the software in the ECU could carry this out.     [4]

      (b)   When the mechanic carries out the first diagnostic test on a car, a series of diagnostic
            trouble codes (DTC) are produced (see Figure 1).

            Explain why a mechanic would need to use an expert system in order to proceed with
            repairing a car.                                                                               [6]

      (c)   Discuss the impacts on motorists and car repair shops of the use of diagnostic expert
            systems to investigate problems in cars.                                                       [8]
