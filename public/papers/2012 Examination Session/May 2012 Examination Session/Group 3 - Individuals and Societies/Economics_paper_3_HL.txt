                             EU court rules minimum price for cigarettes illegal

           The European Court of Justice has ruled that Ireland cannot impose a minimum price
            on cigarettes. It said that member countries would have to find other ways to combat smoking.
            This could be achieved by increasing indirect tax on tobacco, but imposing a minimum price
            would distort fair competition in the market. The ruling is designed to maintain the freedom of
            manufacturers and importers to benefit from lower costs and greater efficiency.

           The judgment said the aim of ensuring that tobacco prices are high can be “adequately” achieved
            by increasing tax, since any indirect tax rises are, sooner or later, reflected in an increased
            retail price, without removing the freedom of manufacturers to set prices.

           The Irish government had claimed that it needed to fix a high minimum price to discourage
            smoking. This followed government legislation to ban tobacco advertising and promotion
            in July 2009. According to a spokesperson from the anti-smoking group ASH (Action on
            Smoking and Health), this measure helped to prevent retail outlets from making young people
            feel attracted to buying cigarettes. “Close to 30 % of our population still smoke and 7000 die
            from tobacco-related disease each year,” he said.

           It has been argued that increasing the price of cigarettes is one of the most effective ways of
            curbing harmful smoking and there is a need to make cigarettes less appealing, particularly to
            young people. The evidence is that banning advertising, introducing minimum pricing and
            increasing health warnings can all work.

           The head of a major retail organization has attacked the idea of minimum pricing
            for cigarettes. He argued that artificially fixing a minimum price would not be effective.
            Also, since the demand for tobacco is inelastic, raising the price would not work. Moreover,
            it was against the free market for a government to set prices for any product available to
            consumers, limiting their freedom to choose.

                                                A new age dawns for Greece

           In a proposed deal aimed at rescuing Greece from near bankruptcy, European Union (EU) and
            International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans of €120 billion should replace the need for Greece
            to borrow at extremely high interest rates. This would be the biggest rescue package for any
            EU country.

           In return, the Greek government has agreed to reduce its budget deficit from nearly 14 % to
            8.1 % of gross domestic product (GDP) by imposing even steeper cuts in public sector wages,
            lower pensions and an additional 2 % rise in VAT, the main indirect tax, to 23 %. Other taxes
            are liable to rise. In one of the biggest changes of all, there will be a change in pensions policy.
            The average age of retirement in Greece is 53 and this could now move to 67.

           The change in circumstances in Greece has been rapid. Greece’s once booming economy
            was based on consumption. Joining the eurozone* in 2001 brought interest rates down, and
            people rushed to get cheap loans. Huge budget deficits and government debt have taken Greece
            into a deep crisis, shaking international markets and the euro. It ran up debts equal to 115 %
            of GDP. In effect, it cannot easily borrow more money because investors fear that they may
            not be repaid. Analysts now think the country’s €240 billion economy is likely to contract in
            2010 by more than last year’s 2 %, as the spending cuts and rising unemployment take effect.
            The IMF said it expects Greece will take 10 years to overcome its financial crisis.

           Many economists warn that the medicine is so strong that it could kill the patient and push
            Greece into a deep economic depression. There have been demonstrations in the streets to
            protest at the measures. A spokesman for a trade union representing the interests of workers,
            said: “These measures are tough and unfair. They will lead workers into misery and the country
            deeper into recession”.

                                Venezuela takes steps to end currency speculation

           Venezuela’s government has approved new legislation in order to curb speculation after its
            currency, the bolivar fuerte (VEF) fell further in the informal market. The reform would give
            the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) exclusive power to authorize the purchase and sale of
            foreign currencies.

           Venezuela has a two-tiered official exchange rate of VEF 4.3 per US$, for most imports,
            and VEF 2.6 per US$ for transactions identified as priorities such as food and medicine.
            However, in the informal market the bolivar fuerte is currently nearly twice as weak as the
            official rate, trading at VEF 8.5 per US$.

           Venezuela’s economy contracted 3.3 % in 2009, and fell into recession for the first time
            since 2003 after oil production and exports plunged. The economy will probably shrink for
            a second consecutive year in 2010. In Venezuela, monthly inflation has quickened to a
            seven-year high and the bolivar fuerte has reached a record low. Venezuelans turn to the
            informal market when they cannot get government approval to buy US dollars at the official
            rates of VEF 2.6 and 4.3 per US$.

           The legislation is aimed at slowing the rapidly falling value of the bolivar fuerte against the
            US dollar in the informal market in hopes of curbing worsening inflation and reducing
            capital flight. “We cannot allow businessmen to take money out of the country and exchange
            it abroad for their own benefit,” said a congressman. The price of US dollars on the informal
            market heavily influences inflation. The BCV said consumer prices jumped 5.2 % in
            April alone, driving the annual inflation rate to 30.4 %.

           An economics professor said the law would not put an end to informal market trading and
            he warned that it could push inflation higher. “More and more control is going to make the
            situation worse,” he said.

                       Reliance on unprocessed exports damages African development

           The poor performance of the textile industry in Africa is caused by its reliance on exports of
            raw cotton. “The heavy dependence on production and export of primary products and the
            weakness of regional markets are the two major causes of Africa’s high vulnerability to external
            shocks,” said an African economist.

           He said that the world economic crisis hit African economies badly, adding that export prices
            and earnings have fallen, resulting in declines in government revenue and national incomes as
            well as rising unemployment and poverty.

           The Kenyan Prime Minister has challenged African firms to focus on the African market before
            exporting the surplus in order to promote intra-African trade. He said the population in Africa
            offered a valuable market for local products but urged African nations to eliminate existing
            barriers to trade, such as tariffs and quotas, to allow trade between African nations. “It is a pity
            that we do not import African goods directly,” he said. “Instead, we export our goods to other
            continents and also purchase African goods from there, due to the high barriers to trade between
            African countries.”

           “African countries have generally purchased fabrics from Asia and designs from Europe
            and the United States. We must help change that to ensure that fabric, design and fashion
            (the entire value chain) stems directly from the African continent.” Africa currently
            produces 12 % of the world’s cotton but 90 % of this is sold to other countries for processing.
            The Prime Minister said that Africa, like some European and Asian countries, can use the
            textile industry to promote economic development.

           Opponents argue that the African economy has been very weak in recent years,
            discouraging trade between African nations. Moreover, political differences have led to
            the tariffs and quotas which restrict such trade. They have pointed out that Europe and the
            United States are wealthy, stable markets with demand for commodities increasing as the
            recession ends.
