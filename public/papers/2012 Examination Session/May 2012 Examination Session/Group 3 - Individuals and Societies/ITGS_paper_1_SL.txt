Answer three questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Implementation of a school database

      Golden Sylvie School needs to be able to manage information such as students’ personal details,
      health details, grades, parents’ contact details and financial statements. To solve this management
      problem the school has purchased a relational database application.

      One purpose of this database is to keep a record of students’ visits to the school nurse. This part of
      the relational database is illustrated below.




      (a)   (i)    State the name of the primary key field of the table tblVisit.                        [1]

		          (ii)   State the relationship between the tables tblNurse and tblVisit.                      [1]

		          (iii) State a field type that would be suitable for Surname in the table tblStudent.         [1]

		          (iv) State a field type that would be suitable for Salary in the table tblNurse.             [1]

		          (v)    State a field type that would be suitable for Sent_Home? in the table tblVisit.       [1]

		          (vi) State a field type that would be suitable for Telephone_Number in the table tblNurse.   [1]




                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      (b)   (i)    The database will allow teachers to export data to a spreadsheet.

			                Explain one reason why teachers would export data from the database to
                   a spreadsheet.                                                                      [2]

		          (ii)   The new database will also require teachers to undertake training to be able to
                   use it.

			                A local company is offering to train users in the use of the new system.
			                The two options proposed are:
                   • online training
                   • face-to-face training.

			                Contrast the two options.                                                           [4]

      (c)   The following screen shows the options this database will have in its online version.

		          When the system was purchased it was possible to include a Virtual Private Network
            (VPN), giving remote access to teachers to this database, which is held on the
            school’s server.

		          Discuss the impact for the school of the decision to allow teachers remote access to the
            school server.                                                                             [8]

2.    Home network

      James and James IT is an IT company that provides customers with a home service and can help them
      install a local area network (LAN) at home. One of the company’s customers is the Perez family.

      James and James IT will analyse the family needs, taking into account the type and number
      of computers that will be used in the house and other peripherals such as printers and scanners.
      It will also investigate the most likely pattern of computer usage to be able to recommend the best
      possible solution.

      (a)   (i)      Identify four advantages of using a home local area network (LAN) rather than
                     several stand alone computers.                                                                          [4]

		(ii)               James and James IT will only deal with the installation of equipment in the house
                     for the local area network (LAN). The family will have to contact the Internet
                     Service Provider (ISP) they wish to use.

			                  Describe the role of the ISP.                                                                           [2]




                                                                         (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      (b)     James and James IT have given the family a choice of a wireless network, a wired network,
              or a mixture of both.

		            The Perez family have chosen to have a combination of wireless and wired networks.
              See the diagram below.



            Internet                                       Ethernet or

		            Explain the decision of the Perez family to install a mixed network.                        [6]

      (c)     The Perez family was concerned about having a peer-to-peer (P2P) network at home
              and decided to ask James and James IT to convert their peer-to-peer network to a
              client-server network.

		            Evaluate this decision.                                                                     [8]

3.    Telemedicine

      Many countries are increasing their use of telemedicine as a method of providing healthcare in remote
      locations. To transfer the data from a remote location to a hospital, two methods may be used:
      real-time or store and forward. Store and forward is a technique common in messaging services.
      Data is sent from one device to a receiving device, but first it passes through an exchange server,
      such as an email server. It may take 24 to 48 hours for the message to be received.




     [Source: http://historiadelatelemedicinaschirlysuarez.blogspot.com/2010/09/importancia-de-la-telemedicina.html, 17 June 2011]


      (a)    (i)     Define the term real-time communication.                                                                        [2]

		           (ii)    After an accident an image of an x-ray of a badly broken leg was taken in bitmap
                     format. To ensure the resolution was clear/high enough for a doctor to see the
                     extent of the injuries, the image size was 12 MB (Megabyte). The connection the
                     doctor will be using has a speed of 240 kb/s (kilobit per second).

			                  Calculate how long it will take to download the image of the x-ray. (Show your
                     working.)                                                                                                       [2]

		           (iii) In some cases the technology available in the remote locations will not allow for
                   large images to be sent to the hospital.

			Identify two methods to resolve this problem.                                                                                     [2]


                                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 3 continued)

      (b)   (i)    Explain one situation in telemedicine that is better suited to real-time data
                   transfer and one situation in telemedicine that is better suited to store and forward
                   data transfer.                                                                          [4]

		          (ii)   Many mobile devices use store and forward to manage data transfer.

			                Explain one reason for using store and forward by such devices.                         [2]

      (c)   In many countries doctors are using videoconferencing to treat patients remotely.
            Evaluate this medical practice.                                                                [8]

4.    Traffic control

      Traffic control systems use digital video cameras at strategic locations to provide a view of the traffic.
      Camera operators are able to move and zoom the cameras. Images are centrally stored on a network
      and can be made available to emergency services and information services. Images can be refreshed
      every 30 seconds.




                     [Source: First image: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trafic_control_center.jpg
              Second image: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:North_end_Truck_1-9_at_Tonnelle_Circle.jpg]


      Traffic control systems provide traffic information to people who request it. This information is
      available at their website or by request via emails or SMS alerts. This allows users to have the latest
      information and traffic updates on the move as information is provided for cell phones and hand-held
      devices as well.

      (a)   (i)   Define the term SMS alerts.                                                                    [2]

		(ii)            Identify two ways information about traffic can be captured electronically at a
                  certain location.                                                                              [2]

		(iii) Outline two ways how this information may be transferred to a central location.                          [2]




                                                                    (This question continues on the following page)

      (b)   The data collected can be used to develop models of traffic flow at various times of the
            day and in various situations such as during periods of heavy snow. Information from
            these models is used to manage traffic flows on major roads and will determine what
            decisions need to be made in controlling traffic on a day-to-day basis.

		          Analyse the decision to use these models to manage traffic flow.                                  [6]

      (c)   Discuss the impact of having the information from traffic control systems available to
            the police.                                                                                       [8]

5.    Improving Lima’s transport system

      Lima has been promoting a new transport system which has been designed to make it easier to travel
      from one side of the city to the other. However, the transport system has not worked as well as
      expected and citizens of Lima have used social networking websites such as Facebook and YouTube
      to report problems, such as extreme delays between buses, or a road accident.




                                            [Used with permission]


      (a)   (i)    Describe what is meant by social networking.                                         [2]

		          (ii)   Different types of files can be uploaded to highlight the traffic problems
                   described above.

			Describe two appropriate types of files which could be uploaded and how they
   highlight the problem.                                                                               [4]

(Question 5 continued)

      (b)   Some managers of local businesses have realized that social networking may provide new
            business opportunities and have created company webpages on Facebook.

		          Explain why companies will use social networking websites to develop new business
            opportunities.                                                                                  [6]

      (c)   Although the Facebook page reporting system is not managed by the Lima authorities,
            they are using it to solve the transport problems that happen in the city of Lima.

		          The Lima authorities are considering implementing an official website for reporting
            transport problems.

		          To what extent is a social networking website preferable to an official website for reporting
            transport problems?                                                                             [8]
