1.   (a)   What does Source A reveal about Sadat’s reasons for attacking Israel
           in October 1973?                                                               [3 marks]

            To try and persuade Israel to make peace so that Egypt could regain the Sinai and
             reopen the Suez canal;
            To attract the attention of the US to the problems in the Middle East;
            To find a way of aligning with the West;
            To overcome Egypt’s problems by reducing the defence burden and by gaining
             domestic stability.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                      [2 marks]

            There is tension in the Middle East;
            There is suspicion of Brezhnev’s intentions (shown by the paper in the hand of the
             person on the left);
            The oil embargo is being used as a weapon;
            Brezhnev is shown as implacable and non-cooperative.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about the
     events of October 1973.                                                         [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both agree that Egypt and Syria attacked Israel;
      Both agree that they were pushed back by Israel after some days;
      Both agree that the superpowers were involved in establishing a ceasefire;
      Both agree that Egypt had the support of other Arab nations; Source C specifically
       mentions the oil embargo and Source D mentions financial and military aid;
      Both agree the superpowers supported their client states.

     For “contrast”
      Source D mentions policy differences between Egypt and Syria; Source C does not;
      Source C focuses more on the causes of the 1973 war, whereas Source D considers its
       consequences;
      Source C mentions the role of the United Nations in achieving a ceasefire, D makes no
       reference to this.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources
     are used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum
     of [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source E for historians studying the October War of 1973.               [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        An International History of the Twentieth Century (published in London in
                    2004) with contributions from a group of leading academics.

     Purpose:       To give information on key historical events in the twentieth century – rather
                    than to score a political point.

     Value:         As it was written by a group of academics the book should be well researched.
                    The publication date allows the benefit of hindsight with regard to the events of
                    1973.

     Limitations:   As it is a history of the whole twentieth century it will have limited detail of the
                    events of October 1973. Also, because it was published in London, it may only
                    offer a western perspective.

     Source E
     Origins:       The United Nations Security Council Resolution 338 (22 October 1973) on the
                    need for a ceasefire.

     Purpose:       To officially record and make known the UN policy with regard to the conflict,
                    an attempt to bring an end to the fighting.

     Value:         Immediacy of this source. Provides evidence of the attitude of the international
                    community at the time.

     Limitations:   Immediacy means that it cannot show how the belligerents actually responded.
                    Also the U.N.’s pacific intent may not reflect the reality.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree
     that Sadat achieved his aims in going to war in 1973?                               [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source shows that Sadat was searching for peace and stability and that he
                  planned a war not only to set up the potential for negotiations but also to regain
                  the Sinai and attract the attention of the U.S.

     Source B:     This source shows that the U.S.S.R. was interested in the Middle East, and that
                   the oil embargo was a major feature of the conflict.

     Source C:     This source indicates that Sadat had created conditions that “broke the
                   deadlock” in the Middle East. It also shows Sadat’s success in gaining the
                   involvement of the superpowers.

     Source D:     This source refers to Arab sympathy and unity and some military success for
                   Egypt. It also indicates the US’s interest in protecting Egypt from defeat. This
                   indicates that Sadat had attracted the attention of the US.

     Source E:     This source states clearly that negotiations were to begin based on UN
                   resolution 242 which aimed at establishing a just, durable peace in the Middle
                   East – this was Sadat’s main aim.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: Cold War context. Egypt’s pride was restored after the
     humiliation of 1967, meetings began in Geneva between the two sides, and Kissinger’s
     “shuttle diplomacy” began which facilitated the peace process. The reopening of the Suez
     Canal in 1975, which would help the Egyptian economy, was agreed. The Sinai was restored
     to Egypt in 1975 and the Camp David agreements led to the Washington Treaty in 1978.
     Other factors could be the willingness of the US to send aid to Egypt and better relations with
     the US and hence the western powers. Sadat did not succeed in getting any resolution of the
     problem of the Occupied Territories. Emergence of the P.L.O. and Arafat – rather than Egypt
     – as the flag bearer of the Palestinian cause.


     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect a balanced argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as
     well as references to the sources used.
