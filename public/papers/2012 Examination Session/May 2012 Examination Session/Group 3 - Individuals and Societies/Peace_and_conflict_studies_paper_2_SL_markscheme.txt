Candidates should answer two questions, each chosen from a different topic. If two essay questions are
chosen from the same topic, only the best essay will contribute to the final grade.

Paper 2 markbands: The following bands must be used in conjunction with the paper-specific
markscheme that follows.

 0:     The candidate does not achieve the standard described in markband 1–3.
 1–3:   There is very limited understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and
        knowledge is inadequate, usually inaccurate and has little relevance to the question. The essay
        seems to lack any plan and is badly organized. Points are presented as isolated pieces of
        information bearing little relation to each other or to the question. Arguments, analysis and
        discussion are absent.
 4–5: There is limited understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        shows serious limitations. Knowledge is frequently inaccurate and often not relevant to
        the question. There is some attempt to plan and organize the essay, but it is very basic.
        Argument, analysis and discussion are very limited.
 6–7: There is some understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is limited, sometimes inaccurate and not always relevant. There are some attempts to put
        together an answer with relevance to the question. Planning and organization of the essay
        is meagre. Arguments, analysis and discussion are limited.
 8–10: The question is generally understood. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge is
        satisfactory, although not all knowledge is accurate or directly relevant. Planning and
        organization are sufficient. Most of the discussion is presented in narrative form. There is
        limited argument and analysis. The answer shows some evidence of ability to exercise
        critical judgment.
 11–13: There is adequate understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is sufficient, generally accurate and directly relevant. Planning and organization are usually
        effective. The answer largely avoids narrative and shows a thoughtful and critical approach.
 14–16: There is a good understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is satisfactory, accurate and directly relevant. Planning and organization are effective.
        The answer shows a clear ability to exercise critical judgment.
 17–20: There is excellent understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is impressive, highly accurate, directly relevant and effective. The essay is well planned and
        elegantly organized. The candidate has a well-developed ability to construct coherent and
        convincing arguments. At the upper end of this markband, the candidate’s work shows a
        confidence and assurance in the handling of evidence and a well-developed and critical sense
        of judgment.

Topic 3: Conflict around the globe

1.   Define the terms “international aid” and “development”, and, with reference to specific
     examples, analyse to what extent these are effective.

     Candidates will have to present definitions of both international aid and development, but may do
     so in a variety of ways. Successful responses are not likely to completely dismiss the effectiveness
     of aid and development, although very critical responses are likely. Elaborate analyses may include
     reference to the difficulties in quantifying development and levels of development. The majority of
     the essay should focus on the development of a clear thesis, in which candidates must refer to actual
     examples to illustrate their key points.

     If no reference to specific examples is made, mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for general comments
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive accounts of aid and development with limited analysis
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory discussion of aid and development and solid analysis of these
     examples
     [14–16 marks] for suitable discussion and clear focus on assessment aid and development
     [17+ marks] for clear and valid discussion and a wide ranging analysis of aid and development.



2.   “Globalization is a new form of imperialism.” With reference to specific examples, to what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     Globalization may be defined as “the widening, deepening and speeding up of worldwide
     interconnectedness in all aspects of contemporary social life,” or in alternative ways. Effective
     responses will also present a definition of “imperialism” before continuing to develop a thesis
     (partially) supporting or dismissing the statement.

     If no reference to specific examples is made, mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for general comments on globalization with little reference to specific examples
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive accounts of globalization with some reference to specific
     examples
     [11–13 marks] for insightful discussion of globalization with relevant reference to some specific
     examples
     [14–16 marks] for a clear and focused discussion of globalization and effective assessment of
     relevant examples
     [17+ marks] for a clear and insightful discussion of globalization and a wide-ranging analytical
     discussion of relevant examples.
                                                 –5–              M12/3/PCONS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




3.   Analyse the key issues of one regional armed conflict of your choice and possible solutions to
     these issues.

     Candidates should identify a major or minor regional armed conflict of their choice. Successful
     answers will focus on the analysis of a key issue of this conflict, and candidates may decide to use
     the conflict triangle in their analysis, identifying the key issue as “C”.

     If the chosen conflict lacks an armed component, mark out of [12 marks]. If no possible solutions
     are offered, mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for a weak analysis of a regional armed conflict
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive accounts of a regional armed conflict with some reference to
     the key issues and some possible solutions
     [11–13 marks] for a satisfactory analysis of a regional armed conflict and possible solutions
     [14–16 marks] for a suitable analysis of a regional armed conflict and an effective assessment of
     possible solutions
     [17+ marks] for a clear and convincing analysis of a regional armed conflict and a thorough
     discussion of possible solutions.
                                                     –6–               M12/3/PCONS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4: Transforming conflict

4.   Compare and contrast the characteristics of terrorism with those of conventional warfare.

     It is likely that candidates will start with definitions of terrorism and conventional warfare and/or
     elaborate on the difficulty of defining these terms. Candidates should compare and contrast,
     although it is likely that responses will focus mainly on the contrasts. Successful responses are
     likely to refer to just war theory, its distinction between legitimate and illegitimate targets, the
     principle of proportionality, and how these principles are at odds with terrorism’s focus on “targets
     of opportunity”. In addition, candidates might elaborate on the difference between symmetric and
     asymmetric conflict, with conventional warfare being an outcome of the first and terrorism of the
     second. Although the question does not specifically ask for the use of examples, it is likely that
     successful responses use examples in their analyses.

     If candidates refer to only terrorism or conventional warfare instead of both, mark out of
     [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for general comments with little focus on comparison and contrast
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive accounts with definition concepts and some comparison and
     contrast
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory definitions and insightful discussion of comparison and contrast
     [14–16 marks] for suitable definitions and clear analysis of comparison and contrast
     [17+ marks] for clear and valid definitions and a wide ranging analytical discussion of a broad
     variety of comparison and contrast.



5.   Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the “responsibility to protect” doctrine.

     In order to address this question effectively, a definition or explanation of the “responsibility to
     protect” (R2P) doctrine is unavoidable, but candidates can do this in a variety of ways. Definitions
     are likely to include that the R2P doctrine states that (i) a State carries the primary responsibility for
     the protection of its population from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic
     cleansing; and (ii) that if a State fails to protect its population or is in fact the perpetrator of crimes,
     the international community must be prepared to take stronger measures, including the collective
     use of force through the UN Security Council.

     This essay asks for the analysis of strengths and weaknesses. Mark out of [12 marks] if only one of
     the two is analysed.

     [0–7 marks] for general comments
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive accounts of strengths and weaknesses
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory definitions and some detailed analysis of the R2P doctrine and its
     strengths and weaknesses
     [14–16 marks] for suitable definitions and clear focus and assessment of the R2P doctrine and its
     strengths and weaknesses
     [17+ marks] for clear and valid definitions and a wide-ranging analysis of the R2P doctrine and its
     strengths and weaknesses.
                                                   –7–               M12/3/PCONS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   “There can be no reconciliation without justice.” With reference to theory and specific
     examples, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates are likely to start this essay with a definition or description of reconciliation, continuing
     with an analysis of how reconciliation can be pursued in a variety of ways. They could, for
     instance, discuss the differences between reconciliation through amnesty (as pursued by Truth and
     Reconciliation commissions) versus reconciliation through justice (as pursued by post-conflict
     crime tribunals). Answers are likely to focus on the question of which of the two is more likely to
     push a society towards positive peace. The discussion may include the idea that positive peace
     includes both a sense of justice and truth.

     If no reconciliation theory/models are used, mark out of [12 marks]. If only theory or examples are
     used, mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for general comments with little reference to the statement in the question
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive reference to the statement with minimal reference to specific
     theories/models
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory use of theories/models and well-argued underpinning of thesis
     [14–16 marks] for a suitable use of theories/models and an effective thesis in support of, or against
     the statement
     [17+ marks] for a wide-ranging and analytical use of theories/models and a highly effective and
     convincing response to the statement.
