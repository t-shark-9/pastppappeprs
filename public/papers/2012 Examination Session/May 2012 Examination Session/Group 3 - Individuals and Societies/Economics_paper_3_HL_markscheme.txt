                       An explanation that it is a market in which resource allocation
                       (or price and/or output) is determined by one of the following:
                        demand and supply

(b)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain the possible effect on the market for
      cigarettes of the ban on tobacco advertising in Ireland.                    [4 marks]

       1   Identification of appropriate theory                                             1–2
           For drawing a demand/supply diagram of the cigarette market showing a
           decrease in demand and a resulting decrease in price and fall in the
           equilibrium quantity or for providing an explanation that a ban on
           advertising would lead to a decrease in demand, leading to a decrease in
           price and fall in the equilibrium quantity.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
           For drawing a demand/supply diagram of the cigarette market showing a
           decrease in demand and a resulting decrease in price and fall in the
           equilibrium quantity and for providing an explanation that a ban on
           advertising would lead to a decrease in demand, leading to a decrease in
           price and fall in the equilibrium quantity.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      Candidates who interpret this as a market failure question may use MSB/MSC
      analysis. MPB shifts left towards MSB as a result of the ban on advertising.
      The effect on the market could be a reduction in the welfare loss. A candidate
      who selects this approach and does not refer to the change in price may
      nevertheless be fully rewarded.

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

      For a market failure diagram, the vertical axis may be price, but could be costs or
      benefits. The horizontal axis is quantity. A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain why, if the demand for cigarettes is
      inelastic, raising the price may not be effective.                         [4 marks]

       1    Identification of appropriate theory                                             1–2
            For drawing a demand diagram of the cigarette market showing that an
            increase in price has a proportionately small effect on the quantity
            demanded or for an explanation that with inelastic demand an increase in
            price will cause a proportionately lower change in quantity demanded, thus
            not working to effectively discourage smoking.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
            For drawing a demand diagram of the cigarette market showing that an
            increase in price has a proportionately small effect on the quantity
            demanded and for an explanation that with inelastic demand an increase in
            price will cause a proportionately lower change in quantity demanded, thus
            not working to effectively discourage smoking.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

      For full marks, candidates must make it clear that the change in quantity
      demanded is relatively (proportionately) smaller than the change in price. It is not
      enough to explain in terms of small changes in quantity demanded with no
      comparison to the change in price.

      A maximum of [2 marks] may be awarded for an answer which rests on the
      assumption that the demand for cigarettes is perfectly inelastic.

      If a candidate has incorrectly labelled the diagram in part (b) and been awarded a
      maximum of [3 marks], then they may achieve full marks in this part of the
      question, if the labelling mistake has been repeated.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the economic effects of the imposition of a minimum price for
      cigarettes.                                                            [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       an explanation and/or a diagram of minimum prices
       an observation that minimum prices are usually set to protect producers, but in
        this case it is being used to solve a market failure.

      Arguments for:
       cigarettes are a demerit good and so their consumption should be reduced
       a higher price could discourage people from smoking (paragraph )
       the imposition of a minimum price could save lives (paragraph )
       the costs of health care could be reduced
       negative externalities such as passive smoking will be reduced
       a higher price will particularly discourage young people (paragraph ), whose
        demand is likely to be more elastic because they earn lower incomes.

      Arguments against:
       informal (parallel/underground/black) markets may appear, reducing the
        effectiveness of the minimum price
       demand for cigarettes is inelastic, so relatively few consumers will be
        discouraged from smoking (paragraph )
       retailers may suffer through fewer sales
       a minimum price may be difficult to enforce
       the option of increasing indirect tax on tobacco may be more effective and adds
        to state resources for implementing alternative policies (paragraph )
       state financing of education campaigns, persuasion through further advertising,
        provision of medical advice and counselling support may be better than
        minimum price
       price controls reduce freedom of choice for consumers and producers
       the cost of living will increase for consumers who buy cigarettes
       distributional effects because lower income households’ real incomes will fall
        more.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.

                        unemployment that occurs as a result of the changing structure of

            a decrease in supply and a resulting increase in price and fall in the
            equilibrium quantity or for providing an explanation that the ETS will
            increase costs for a polluting firm, causing the supply of electricity to

      Candidates may draw the market for carbon permits (perfectly inelastic supply
      curve) with either a leftward shift of supply or an increase in the demand for
      permits and therefore an increase in the price of permits, leading to an increase
      in the costs of production and higher prices for electricity.

            equilibrium above a socially efficient level of output or for providing an

            to third parties and are therefore a market failure where the market fails
            to produce at the socially efficient level of output.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                            3–4

      Candidates may approach this question by using a negative externality of
      consumption model. If the explanation matches the diagram, and is correctly
      explained, this may be rewarded full marks.

      Candidates may use a supply and demand model to illustrate the market failure.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,

      Responses may include:
       since there is a significant market failure with implications for sustainable
        development, some solution to “the great moral and economic challenge” is
        needed (paragraph )
       Australia is the third largest per capita polluter, necessitating a
        solution/approach (paragraph )
       the ETS will increase costs for heavy polluters and decrease costs for low
        polluters. This should incentivise firms to reduce emissions and internalise the
        externality (paragraph )
       carbon permits will increase the marginal private costs to firms moving the
        market closer to the socially efficient level of output
       additional costs to heavy polluters are likely to be passed on to consumers
        (paragraph ), resulting in higher energy prices and inflation in the economy
       as a result of higher costs faced by firms, supply will fall with the possible
        result that jobs are lost in the heavy polluting industries (paragraph ).
        (Diagram from (b) could be referred to showing that the increased costs could
        cause inflation and unemployment.)
       loss in profits may reduce investment, and therefore productivity (paragraph
        ), having long term implications for economic growth

      Candidates may approach this question using a macroeconomic model. An
      increase in indirect taxes will lead to an increase in the costs of production for
      firms, and therefore a decrease in short run aggregate supply, an increase in
      the price level and a decrease in real GDP.

            will decrease, leading to a fall in real GDP.

      Candidates may use either a Keynesian AS curve or an upward-sloping short

      Responses may include:
       a definition of debt
       the proposed cut in the budget is an extremely large one
       steep cuts in public sector wages may result in less consumption by public
        sector workers, further affecting AD
       lower pensions may reduce living standards for retired people (and may lower
        consumption, further affecting AD (paragraph )
       raising the retirement age may increase the size of the working population and
        might actually increase unemployment in the short run
       reductions in public sector wages may affect the quality of services such as
        health care and education (paragraph ); this may reduce the productivity of
        labour, further worsening economic growth in the future
       a reduction in the budget deficit (paragraph ) may restrict growth and lead
        the country further into recession (may refer to diagram and analysis in part (c)
       an increase in indirect taxation will increase prices (paragraph ) (may refer to
        diagram in part (b)
       an increase in indirect taxes will be regressive, therefore resulting in greater
        income inequality
       with a low level of inflation, the measures may push Greece into deflation
        (table)
       a reduction in the budget deficit acts as an expenditure-reducing policy which
        may lead to lower imports and an improvement in the current account balance
        (table)
       lower wage rates and falling inflation could reduce production costs and
        contribute towards an improvement in the current account balance (table) and
        (paragraph )
       reducing the deficit will reduce the need for government borrowing, which is
        very high (table)
       the measures may allow the government to borrow at lower rates (paragraph
        )
       Greece’s GDP growth indicator was not as bad as the average in the eurozone
        (table)
       the deficit reducing measures may worsen growth to the extent that the deficit
        will actually grow (higher unemployment will reduce government’s tax
        revenues)
       Greece has to prove that it can repay its debts, but the measures adopted may
        make the debt worse
       a Keynesian approach would be opposite to the approach taken – government
        should actively adopt measures to increase AD to promote growth in order to
        be able to reduce the deficit over the longer term.

      N.B. It is also acceptable for candidates to answer the question by showing a
      shift of AD to the right and an explanation that a weaker currency will make
      exports more competitive, causing an increase in exports and an increase in AD
      which will lead to a higher price level and therefore upward pressure on
      inflation.

      Since the question does not specify a diagram, candidates may also choose to
      draw a diagram to illustrate the fall in the value of the VEF, and then explain
      how this will lead to increased costs of production and therefore result in
      inflation. If the exchange rate diagram is correctly explained and labelled
      (vertical axis – price of VEF in USD or USD/VEF), and then appropriately
      linked to inflation, then this may be fully rewarded.

        attractiveness of domestic and foreign direct investment
       currency depreciation, causing inflation, may be prevented (paragraph )
       capital flight may be discouraged as fears of devaluation are lowered
       economic problems such as recession and inflation have to be tackled without
        allowing the exchange rate to solve the problems the economy
       the double-tiered fixed-exchange rate system is designed to produce a more
        equal distribution of income as food and medicine are imported at lower prices
        compared to other imports.

      Disadvantages of a fixed exchange rate:
       the official rate does not correspond to the “real” value of the currency as
        proven by the low value on the informal market
       the formal banking system is unlikely to attract savings when there is such a
        divergence between the official rate and the informal rate. Thus there may be
        less money available for investment
       the VEF seems to be fixed at too strong a value, which damages exporters and
        adversely affects the current account balance
       a fixed VEF may actually encourage currency speculation (paragraph ) if
        people believe that the central bank will not be able to support the value
       a fixed exchange rate may mean that the central bank will have to buy its own
        currency in the foreign exchange market. This means that it will have to
        maintain large reserves of foreign currencies – this may be unsustainable
       inflation may be imported via a fixed exchange rate system
       it encourages a destabilising informal market – managing the informal market
        may make the situation worse (paragraph )
       it introduces a distortion to the market where prices do not reflect their costs.

      Answers that discuss the standard advantages and disadvantages of fixed
      exchange rates, without showing awareness of the Venezuelan context may not
      be rewarded beyond Level 2.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

(b)   Explain one reason why a dependence on exports of primary products
      may be considered a barrier to economic development.                              [4 marks]

       1   Identification of appropriate theory                                             1–2
           For explaining an appropriate reason why exports of primary product
           may result in low and fluctuating incomes for producers and/or revenues
           for governments.

           The explanations might refer to:
            low PED, PES or YED
            primary products are of low value on the production chain (in
             comparison with processed products) and so the producers earn low
             incomes even in good economic times
            increased supply of primary products due to technological improvements
            vulnerability to forces outside producer control (e.g. weather,
             international shocks).

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
           For explaining how low incomes/revenues may act as a barrier to
           economic development. The explanations might refer to:
            unstable revenues for governments make it difficult to allocate funds to
              development objectives
            low incomes for producers mean that producers may be stuck in a
              poverty cycle.

(c)   With the aid of a diagram, explain how the reduction of tariffs is likely to

       1   Identification of appropriate theory                                            1–2

           a tariff causes a fall in the price and an increase in imports or for
           explaining how a reduction in the tariff results will reduce the price

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                       3–4

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      discuss the view that African countries should increase their focus on
      trade within Africa in order to increase economic development.                         [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      Opportunities associated with increased trade:
       reliance on exports of raw cotton makes African nations vulnerable to market
        fluctuations (paragraph ) resulting in wide fluctuations in export revenues
        and preventing governments from achieving development objectives
       greater intra-Africa trade allows African countries to enjoy the advantages of
        trade creation
       greater processing of raw materials in African countries would allow other
        African countries to buy the processed goods at lower prices. (Instead of
        having the raw materials exported to processors in more developed countries,
        with the gains going to producers in the non-African countries) (paragraph )
       poverty in Africa has increased due to the world economic crisis. If African
        countries traded more with each other, they would be less exposed to shocks
        from any one particular region (paragraph )
       freer trade with other African countries will increase the potential market size
        (paragraph )
       reduced transportation costs of shipping to neighbours
       increased export revenues may allow governments to pursue development
        objectives
       higher producer revenues may allow producers to escape the poverty cycle.

      Challenges 
       it will be difficult to increase intra-Africa trade because of poor infrastructure
        and transportation links, along with weak institutions
       political differences and historic protectionism may make increased intra-
        African trade difficult (paragraph )
       USA and Europe provide stable, affluent markets which are growing following
        the recession (paragraph )
       the African economy is still relatively weak and so may not provide growth
        and therefore development (paragraph ).
