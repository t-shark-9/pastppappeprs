These sources and questions relate to the struggle for power following the death of Mao Zedong
(Mao Tse-tung), Hua Guofeng (Hua Kuo-feng), the re-emergence of Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing) and
the defeat of the Gang of Four.

SOURCE A                Extract from China Against the Tides: Restructuring through Revolution, Radicalism
                        and Reform by Marc Blecher, 2010. Published by Continuum International

Hua Guofeng (Hua Kuo-feng) attempted to find a middle ground between the rival policy positions.
He presided over a campaign to criticize the Gang of Four, but continued to praise the Cultural Revolution.
He associated himself with Maoist models of agriculture and industry, with targets requiring sacrifice
and effort.

The animosities that divided China’s leadership during the Cultural Revolution proved too difficult
to overcome. Hua lacked the political support, acumen [political skill], experience, and sheer, sometimes
ruthless, determination of Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing).


SOURCE B                Extract from The New Emperors: China in the Era of Mao and Deng, by Harrison

Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) understood the basic precept – divide and reign. He did not trust Jiang Qing
(Chiang Ch’ing) or her comrades. He had not trusted Zhou Enlai (Chou En-lai) for a long time. So when
Zhou fell ill, Mao resisted Jiang’s (Chiang’s) efforts to put her man into place and reached for Deng (Teng).
But, as usual, Deng (Teng) was too much in a hurry. If Hua was premier, then Deng (Teng) was out
– or worse. When the Gang of Four members protested that he was too unknown, Mao waved them away.

Mao’s politics had reversed themselves. The filth spewed in the press against Deng (Teng) left no doubt
how dangerous he was to the Gang of Four. It was so sensational it built up public support for Deng (Teng).
If he was so bad in the eyes of the Gang of Four, he must have been very, very good.

SOURCE C               Extract from a speech by Hua Guofeng (Hua Kuo-feng) to the Standing Committee

Our party quickly crushed the criminal scheme of the Wang-Chang-Chiang-Yao “Gang of Four” to usurp
the supreme leadership of the Party and the state. The smashing of this gang brought great joy to the Party,
the army and the people. The tremendous victory of this great political revolution ushered in a new stage
of development in our country’s socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Because of the interference and sabotage by the Lin Piao (Lin Biao) anti-Party clique and the anti-Party
“Gang of Four” in particular, some bad people managed to worm their way into the revolutionary committees
of the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, and some members of the revolutionary
committees made grave mistakes in the two-line struggles but have refused to repent; they have thus
alienated themselves from the masses and can no longer represent the people.

Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) died September 1976. The first stage of the ensuing power struggle
was brief; the Gang of Four were arrested within less than a month. There were two main factions
among the winners of this struggle. One comprised the less extreme Maoists, who had risen to power
during the Cultural Revolution and who wished to preserve many of Mao’s policies, but who (unlike the
Gang of Four) were willing to co-operate with more conservative elements. Their main leaders were
Hua Guofeng (Hua Kuo-feng), whom Mao had designated as his successor before dying, and
Wang Tung-hsing (Wang Dongxing). This group published an editorial saying that whatever Mao had
said must be obeyed and whatever he had decided must be upheld.

The other group was made up of right-wing leaders who had been purged in the Cultural Revolution.
Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing) was the most important member.

Deng and other recently rehabilitated rightists blamed leftist excesses on Lin Piao (Lin Biao) and the
Gang of Four, not on Mao.

Hua’s status as Mao’s chosen heir was losing value, and even becoming a liability. China was increasingly
dominated by those wishing to move quickly and decisively away from Mao’s policies.
