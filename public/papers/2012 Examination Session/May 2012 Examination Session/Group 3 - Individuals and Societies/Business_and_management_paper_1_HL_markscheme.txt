                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   General Ron Meiri was autocratic (lines 8–9). Identify four key features of
           an autocratic leadership style.                                             [4 marks]

           An autocratic leadership style has features such as:
            the leader wants to hold on to as much power, authority and control as possible
            the leader does not delegate
            employees are not involved in consultation
            employees are just expected to obey
            accept any other relevant feature.


           N.B. Answers about organizational structure (centralized, tall) are not directly
           relevant and should not be credited.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct feature identified, up to a maximum of [4 marks].

     (b)   “The organizational structure of the UWP Mission was tall” (lines 9–10).
           Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of this type of structure.    [4 marks]

           A tall organizational structure has the following advantages:
            hierarchies and managerial chains of command are clear and unambiguous
            roles, posts and departments tend to be highly specialized
            rules and procedures are written and formalized
            the working environment is often very stable
            accept any other relevant advantage.

           A tall organizational structure has the following disadvantages:
            it may appear impersonal, overly administrative and bureaucratic
            decision-making can be slow and centralized
            employees are not encouraged to participate or share their views
            responding to changes in the internal or external environment can be slow
            accept any other relevant disadvantage.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct advantage/disadvantage identified, and [1 mark]
           for the appropriate explanation of that advantage/disadvantage up to a maximum
           of [2 marks].

     (c)   Analyse the appropriateness of a bank loan as a source of finance for
           Kos Palouk’s new lorry (lines 129–130).                               [7 marks]

           The bank loan is appropriate because it is a well-established method of external
           funding to buy fixed assets such as machinery or property. In Loyka, Kos may
           not have access to other sources of external funding such as venture capitalists.
           Moreover, due to the small size of his part-time business and the fact that he can
           only save $100 a month before tax (Appendix 5), he probably does not have
           enough savings or retained profit for internal funding.

           However, the bank loan may not be appropriate because Kos would have to pay
           interest, even if he is not very successful at the start. Besides, the bank manager
           requires the lorry as collateral: this means that one day Kos could lose his lorry if
           he does not keep up with repayments, which is vital for the business, even if he
           has paid back some of the loan.

           N.B.
            Candidates may refer to other sources of finance (such as leasing); this is an
             acceptable way to analyse the appopriateness of the bank loan, as opposed to
             other sources of finance. This should be credited.
            As in all answers, correct use of subject terminology (e.g. about retained profit)
             should be credited.
            Candidates are not required to make any recommendation at the end; the ones
             who do so will not receive extra marks, as the command term is “analyse” and
             not “recommend”.

           Accept any other relevant analysis.


           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.


2.   (a)   Loyka’s economy is mainly in the primary sector (line 1). Briefly describe
           the nature of business activity in this sector.                            [2 marks]

           The primary sector of an economy includes agriculture as well as fishing, forestry
           and mining. It converts natural resources into primary products.

           Accept any other relevant description.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct element of the description up to a maximum of
           [2 marks].

(b)   Outline one reason why Kos Palouk does not need to do any additional
      marketing at the UWP Mission.                                        [2 marks]

      Kos does not need to do any additional marketing at the UWP Mission because he
      is already known there: he already has an established base of customers who trust
      him (customer loyalty) and will be ready to buy more produce from him.

      Accept any other relevant answer.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic outline that shows some knowledge and
      understanding.

      Award [2 marks] for a clear outline that shows clear knowledge and
      understanding.

(c)   Using information from Appendix 5a,

      (i)    calculate the net profit margin and the gross profit margin for
             Kos Palouk from his current operation (Option 1).                            [2 marks]

      (ii)   calculate the net profit margin and the gross profit margin for
             Kos Palouk from his forecast operation (Option 2).              [2 marks]

                                     4000


             Award [1 mark] for each correct answer, up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(d)   Interpret your results from part (c) and the data from Appendix 5a and 5b.            [7 marks]

      The calculations show that the net profit margin for the forecast operation
      increases by 2.5 % and the gross profit margin increases by 5 %
      (from 50 % to 55 %).

      For the forecast operation (Option 2), gas and vehicle maintenance are eight
      times higher ($400 as opposed to $50) as it involves more driving, and there is a
      new type of expense (rent of storage facility for $200 per month), however Kos
      can multiply his sales by ten (from $400 to $4000) and realize economies of scale.
      The forecast operation also means that he would multiply his income more than
      twice (from $650 to $1500, see Appendix 5b). As he needs $550 to support
      himself and his family, he currently saves $100 every month (before tax).
      With the forecast operation, if he expands, he could save over $900 a month
      ( $1500  $550  $950 ) though not all of it would be personal savings as he would
      need to pay back the bank loan (currently $100 interest a month) and any tax
      (he is likely to pay more taxes).

      The profitability ratios overall show that Kos’ operations (the current one as well
      as the forecast one) are financially healthy, however the forecast one (Option 2)
      shows a slightly higher margin (for both net and gross profit), which could
      support the choice for that option.

      Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

     (b)   With reference to Kos Palouk’s business, distinguish between just-in-time
           and just-in-case stock control (lines 136–138).                           [4 marks]

           Just-in-time (JIT) stock control means that Kos was only buying stock
           (fresh produce) from suppliers (farmers) when required, for example when he had
           particular orders from the UWP Mission. This was a good way for him to avoid
           storage and wastage.

           Just-in-case (JIC) stock control means that Kos would need to buy produce and
           keep a reserve (the buffer stock); he would need to store the produce, which is
           why he would require a storage facility with a refrigerated room for the eggs,
           vegetables and poultry. With just-in-case stock control, Kos would be ready to
           deliver larger amounts of produce to the new university or hospital, whenever
           required.

(c)   Analyse the value of the social and environmental audit (line 96) for both
      General Diane Pierce and the local community.                              [7 marks]

      The results of the formal social and environmental audit of the construction of
      both facilities will enable General Diane Pierce to assess the relative impacts of
      the two proposed facilities (university vs hospital) and to make a more informed
      decision. Some of the results of the audit will probably be positive in the short
      term (e.g. by increasing access to medical sources straightway) and in the long
      term (e.g. by training the next generation of Loykese engineers, teachers
      and nurses), but some others may be negative (e.g. the destruction of the botanical
      gardens).

      The audit will also be of value for the local community as it represents a channel
      to express their views, either to express approval (e.g. as there is a lack of doctors
      in Loyka) or disapproval (e.g. about the issue of foreign male doctors looking
      after local female patients). Audits make it possible to go beyond the anecdotal
      (e.g. the earlier conflicts between the local governor and General Ron Meiri) and
      to have a more holistic, objective view with recommendations.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      N.B. candidates may not refer much to environmental aspects; this is acceptable
      as there is little in the case study about that. There is no expectation that
      candidates will cover social and environmental aspects to the same extent, as the
      focus here is on social impacts.

4.   (a)   Describe the use and value of a critical path analysis (lines 87–88).                 [4 marks]

           A critical path analysis (CPA) is useful for long and complex projects that are
           composed of several events/activities. It is useful as a planning tool (for example
           to allocate resources), as an aid for time management (when one must calculate
           the critical path itself) and also as a decision-making tool for project management
           (for example about prioritizing tasks). It can also be used as a control tool to
           assess the progress gradually made. As there is a predetermined schedule
           (represented by the network diagram), a CPA is valuable for monitoring
           achievement (for example to identify delays; some may have impacts on the
           overall duration of the project, others may not).

           Accept any other relevant point.

     (b)   Explain two methods of sampling that Colonel Michael Donovan could have
           used to carry out the primary research (line 97).                       [4 marks]

           Colonel Michael Donovan could have used several sampling methods, such as:
            quota sampling (this means that he would have specific shares/allocations, for
             example 30 % of respondents from the 30–40 year old age bracket)
            random sampling (this means that he would have to get a sample of a
             cross-section of the population, for example by taking every 200th name in the
             list of registered Loykese voters)
            stratified sampling (this means that he would target the people most likely to
             use the university and hospital, for example secondary age school children and
             pregnant women)
            cluster sampling (this means that he would focus his research on a particular
             location or population, for example people in the vicinity of the
             botanical gardens)
            snowball sampling (this means that he would start with a small number of
             respondents who, in turn, would help recruit others, for example teachers or
             stakeholders of the university).

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct method of sampling identified and
           [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation of that sampling method up to a

           N.B. If there is no reference to the case study award a maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of the organizational culture of
      military organizations such as the UWP Mission.                             [4 marks]

      A military organization may be considered to have a role culture. The ranks
      define peoples’ jobs and roles. The tall organizational structure and many levels
      of hierarchy also lend itself to role culture.

      However, the project teams such as the SAS, SBS, Green Berets and other
      non-traditional specialized military units are much more task culture orientated.

      The organizational culture of military organizations such as the UWP Mission has
      the following advantages:
       the culture is characterised by a desire for stability and control as well as
         formal rules and policy, so it is congruent with a tall structure and an autocratic
         leadership style (such as General Ron Meiri)
       orders are always followed, so the organization can be very efficient with
         regard to operations and tactics, as it is goal-orientated and results-orientated
         (for example, if they decide to build the hospital, it will happen)
       the organization promotes from within, so staff know the routes for promotion
         and have a strong sense of respect for seniority (as showed by the relationship
         between Colonel Michael Donovan and General Diane Pierce)
       accept any other relevant advantage.

      The organizational culture of military organizations such as the UWP Mission has
      the following disadvantages:
       the focus on well-established norms and values means that the organization
         could ignore the norms and values of the society where it operates
         (here: possible tension with Loykese culture)
       the stable culture of the military implies a resistance to change, be it as a result
         of internal or of external forces (so even the arrival of General Diane Pierce
         with her situational leadership style could create some tension with some staff
         more used to an autocratic leadership style)
       new ideas are not sought and are rarely welcome (so even if some members of
         the civil engineering group under Colonel Michael Donovan have valid ideas
         or objections, they are not likely to raise them)
       accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct advantage/disadvantage identified and [1 mark]
      for an appropriate explanation of that advantage/disadvantage up to a maximum

(d) Recommend to General Diane Pierce whether the hospital should be built.               [8 marks]

     Several factors would suggest that the hospital should be built:
      there is a clearly identified need for a hospital (for example the complications
       from a lack of prenatal care have recently increased) and this would have
       immediate benefits (as opposed to the longer term impacts of the university)
      the results from the survey showed that a slight majority (52 %) preferred the
       hospital (so there is market research evidence) compared to 49 % for the
       university
      Colonel Donovan (who has coordinated the research and has been in the
       country for longer than General Pierce) recommends the hospital
      it would help the UWP Mission reach its strategic objective to improve the
       image of “the Olive Hats” and to display their corporate social responsibility
       by improving the healthcare of the Loykese.

     However, some other factors go against recommending the hospital:
      many locals have formulated objections to the hospital (for example about the
       presence of foreign male doctors): the survey showed that 17 % of respondents
       strongly opposed the hospital (this is a large proportion: more than one person
       in six) whereas only 10 % strongly opposed the university
      there is an opportunity cost when compared to the university (which also
       presents advantages), as noted by several stakeholders including the local
       governor who favours the university
      the alternative project (the university) would equally fit with the mission to
       improve the image of “the Olive Hats”, showing how they contribute to the
       sustainable development of Loyka, by training future professionals such as
       teachers, nurses, doctors and engineers.

     Candidates need to have a clear conclusion.

     Accept any other relevant recommendation.


     N.B. Candidates who use a force field analysis (or any other decision-making)
     model to answer this question should be rewarded for doing so.

5.   (a)   Identify two advantages to Kos Palouk of merging his wholesale produce
           business with Sami Taibi’s grocery store.                              [2 marks]

           Advantages of a merger include:
            the combined business would have greater financial strength than Kos’
             business alone
            it would be easier to obtain loans from banks and other sources
            two revenue streams provide security if either of the divisions of the business
             experiences a decline in revenue
            Kos’ business would immediately have a large and reliable customer
            accept any other relevant advantage.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct advantage identified up to a maximum
           of [2 marks].

           N.B. The question is from the perspective of Kos: be sure that the advantage
           identified is from Kos’ perspective, not Sami’s.

     (b) Explain two advantages to Sami Taibi and Kos Palouk of organizing the new
         (merged) business as a private limited company.                           [4 marks]

           Advantages of organizing the new business as a private limited company include:
            capital can be raised by selling shares, typically to friends or relatives of
             Sami and/or Kos
            as a corporation, there is legal continuity if one or more of the principals passes
             away
            because private limited companies are typically better capitalized than sole
             traders or partnerships, they generally find it easier to borrow funds
            control of the company can be maintained, as shareholders can control who
             additional shareholders will be
            all shareholders have limited liability
            accept any other relevant advantage with an explanation.

(d)   Using Vroom’s expectancy theory of motivation, or any other motivation
      theories, examine Sami Taibi’s proposal.                               [9 marks]

      If candidates choose to use Vroom then they would be expected to include the
      three main points:
       what workers value
       what workers think they can succeed in doing
       what rewards they will get from the business if they succeed.

      Vroom’s expectancy theory fits well with Sami’s proposal. Kos gets a 25 % share
      of the new business – clearly this is what Kos values – he likes owning his own
      business and would want to be part-owner of the new business. Sami has set Kos
      targets and if these are met then Kos receives an additional 24 % share in the
      business (Item 3.2) – Kos probably believes he can meet these targets. If he does,
      the rewards he gets are what he wants, which again fits well with Vroom’s
      expectancy theory.

      At the higher markbands candidates would be expected to also refer to three terms
      used by Vroom – expectancy, instrumentality and valence. If Kos works hard
      there is a high expectancy that he will succeed. The agreement between Sami and
      Kos gives instrumentality – if the targets are met then Kos’ share of the business
      increases by 24 %. Kos is highly likely to value the extra 24 % ownership and
      therefore valence is likely to be high.

      Candidates can consider other theorists to examine Sami Taibi’s proposal.
      The following is a guide of the theories that could be used with
      further examination:
       Adams – equity clearly may be an issue here, not just with the issue of the
         shares allocation, but the owner/employee aspect too.
       Herzberg – hygiene factors are not necessarily motivators but they can
         be demotivators.
       McGregor – is Sami a theory x manager? Does he not trust Kos enough?
       Maslow – security needs should be addressed but there are positive and
         negative aspects for Kos.
       Mayo – the human element is important here because the focus seems to be on
         management by objective (MBO) and so it is lacking.
       McClelland – clearly Kos has less power and also affiliation even if he
         achieves the goal set for him. Sami is still the power player and Kos
         the subordinate.
       Taylor – pay and Kos’ salary and share option are relevant, but how would
         Sami be motivated?

      Accept any other relevant examination.

(e)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 4, advise
      Kos Palouk on Sami Taibi’s proposal.                                   [12 marks]

      It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers are likely to include a
      much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified below. There is no
      “correct” answer.

      Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and
      evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus materials.

      It is to be expected that the answer will include relevant information from the case
      study, extension material and Items 1–4 and employ a range of business concepts,
      tools and terminology.

      Sami’s proposal has advantages and disadvantages for Kos. In terms of
      advantages for Kos, the most important are that he would soon be part-owner of
      what one can assume to be an established business (Sami’s grocery store) and
      have considerable opportunity to see his own stake in the business increase (from
      25 % to 49 %). In addition, the two “divisions” of the proposed business are
      complementary. The wholesale division will immediately strengthen the grocery
      store operation, providing it with a reliable source of fresh produce at low prices.
      The balance sheet of the two operations would also be complementary. Grocery
      stores typically operate with positive working capital (because sales are cash),
      while wholesale operations such as Kos’ have working capital requirements.

      In addition, because the wholesale operation will have to purchase for both Sami’s
      grocery store as well as the other retail outlets that Kos plans to sell to, Kos’
      operation should be able to negotiate favourable prices when purchasing
      (purchasing economies of scale). The size of the business is a benefit for another
      reason: to support two lorries. With only one lorry, periods of vehicle
      maintenance would mean interruption of Kos’ service to his customers. There
      would be other benefits of the merger as well: a deeper management pool, the
      combined business networks of both principals, a cleaner path to management
      continuity if one of the principals were to get sick or pass away.

      All of these benefits, however, can obscure one significant potential negative:
      Kos would not be his own boss. Though the structure of the merger would give
      Kos considerable incentive to work hard and, in certain respects, elements of his
      future are in his own hands, Sami will still be his boss and will still own the
      majority of the company (75 % initially and 51 % if Kos does meet the
      performance targets). At Kos’ age, accustomed to running his own small business
      and seriously entertaining the idea of going on his own full-time, he may chafe
      having to work for someone else (to be sure, he has done so working in the
      officers’ dining facility at the UWP Mission, but that was a minor position).
      Under Sami’s proposal, Kos would be working full-time for the new business and
      have to answer to Sami.
                                     – 20 –           M12/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Though the two men have known each other, and presumably discussed many
issues to make sure that they could work well together, actually working together
may prove challenging. Sami has always owned 100 % of his business, and his
leadership style over the years may have developed in a non-democratic direction.
His leadership style in general may not dovetail with Kos’. There could well be
times when Kos, as 25 % owner, may have to make supervisory decisions in
Sami’s absence. Will Kos exercise his managerial authority in a manner
consistent with Sami’s?

Another major consideration is the actual business plan. The deterioration of the
situation in the countryside could be a challenge for Kos. As excited as he is
about the business opportunity, he is not young (mid-50s) and the situation in the
countryside is deteriorating, which could make for dangerous work and, possibly,
more physically demanding work than he wants or should do (long detours on
rough roads, changing tyres/managing minor repairs in difficult circumstances,
etc.). The deterioration of the situation in the countryside could also make
reaching the sales targets more difficult than he thinks, which could mean that he
does not eventually get the 49 % ownership in the business that he wants.

There are many other advantages and disadvantages to Sami’s proposal.

Accept any other relevant advice.
