1.   Explain briefly the meaning of the following terms in Source B:

     (a)   Obedience (line 1)                                                            [2 marks]

           The candidate will gain [1 mark] for a sufficient explanation of the word “obedience”
           such as “Obedience means listening to and doing what others tell you regardless of your
           own opinion.” The candidate will gain [2 marks] for giving a more academic definition
           (e.g. “A change in belief or behaviour in response to actual direction by a recognized
           authoritative figure”).

     (b)   Legitimate authority (line 5)                                                 [2 marks]

           The candidate who simply rephrases the term (e.g. “An authority that is considered
           legitimate”) will gain [0 marks]. The candidate will gain [1 mark] for a brief
           explanation of the term. The candidate will gain [2 marks] for demonstrating a more
           thorough understanding of the term, or one related directly to Milgram’s experiment.



2.   Analyse the following statement from Source A, “There‟s no opportunity for
     them to say „What‟s my moral stance on this?‟” (lines 22–23). Answer with
     reference to Source A and to the other sources where relevant.                      [4 marks]

     [1 mark] will be awarded for a superficial attempt to answer the question. Answers that only
     explain what the author might mean will gain up to [2 marks]. For [3 marks], the candidate
     will analyse the statement in the context of studies in obedience and, possibly, conformity,
     referring effectively to the sources provided in this paper. [4 marks] will be awarded for an
     exemplary answer, showing a deeper understanding of experiments in obedience to authority
     and making effective use of the source(s).



3.   Compare and contrast the opinion expressed by Dr Bernard Starr in
     Source D with those put forward in Sources A and C.                                 [4 marks]

     Candidates must relate the statement of Source D to both Sources A and C. Answers relating
     to only Source A or Source C will be awarded a maximum of [2 marks]. Answers should
     focus on significant differences and similarities between Starr’s position in Source D and the
     positions expressed in Sources A and C. [1 mark] will be awarded for a superficial attempt to
     answer the question. Answers that only mention differences or similarities will receive a
     maximum of [2 marks]. For [2 marks], the candidate will mention the main similarity and
     difference between Source D and Sources A and C. For [3 marks], the candidate will
     mention at least two similarities and two differences between these sources. [4 marks] will be
     awarded for an exemplary answer, showing a deep understanding of the interrelations of the
     three sources.
                                              –4–           M12/3/PCONS/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



4.   To what extent can psychological studies give a convincing explanation for
     human cruelty? Answer with reference to the sources and to your own
     knowledge.                                                                         [8 marks]

     This is a mini-essay. Candidates should analyse the strengths and weaknesses of obedience
     studies such as the ones conducted by Stanley Milgram, and relate these to recent
     “reproductions” and related studies such as those conducted by Asch as discussed in
     Source C. Answers that use only own knowledge or only information from the sources will
     receive a maximum of [4 marks]. For [1–2 marks], the candidate must examine these issues
     superficially. For [3–4 marks], the candidate must answer the question with satisfactory but
     limited arguments or with little reference to the sources. [5–6 marks] will be awarded if the
     candidate analyses the strengths and weaknesses in a relevant and accurate way.
     The candidate must develop a solid thesis followed by a compelling and relevant argument.
     [7–8 marks] will be awarded if the candidate offers deeper insight beyond these references.
     Full marks can also be awarded to answers challenging the assumptions made in one or more
     of the sources in a profound way, showing insights beyond the demands of the question.
