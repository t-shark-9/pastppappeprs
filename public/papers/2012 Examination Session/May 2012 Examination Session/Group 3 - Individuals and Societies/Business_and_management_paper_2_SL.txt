2.    Bangkok Shrimp (BS)

      In 2011, an environmental catastrophe contaminated the waters off the
      coast of South America, one of the main fishing areas of the world.
      As a result of the catastrophe (and the resulting lower supply of shrimp),
      the price of shrimp worldwide increased by 30 %. Aroon Bhuvanadh,
      owner of Bangkok Shrimp (BS) located in Thailand, saw this as an
      excellent opportunity to expand his business. He decided to increase
      the number of his shrimp boats from two to three in order to benefit
      from the higher prices and profits.                                  [image: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/
                                                                               File:Prawn_%28PSF%29.png; Pearson Scott
                                                                                             Foresman]

      The price of the new shrimp boat is $175 000. If the selling price of shrimp remains at the current
      high levels, anticipated profits per boat after all expenses would be $35 000 per year. If prices fall to
      pre-2011 levels, the profit would decrease to $10 000. Aroon’s bank will provide finance for the new
      boat. If the new boat is properly maintained, it will last longer than the proposed seven-year term of
      the bank loan.

      Aroon captains one of the existing boats. He currently employs an experienced captain for the second
      boat, and he will have to recruit an additional experienced captain for the third boat.

      Aroon’s wife Kanya is worried that the price of shrimp may return to pre-2011 levels before the
      bank loan is repaid. For this reason, she wants to change the legal structure of the business from a
      sole trader to a private limited company.

      Aroon has a vision: by taking advantage of the opportunity of the current high shrimp prices, he will
      own three shrimp boats and, later, can leave one boat to each of his three sons when he and Kanya
      retire in 2017.



                                                                (This question continues on the following page)

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Hands

      Hands, a partnership set up in 1968 in southern Argentina, manufactures hand-knitted items such as
      sweaters, scarves, bags, carpets and blankets produced under job production methods. It employs
      around 300 craftswomen from the rural areas of Patagonia. Workers are paid on a piece rate basis.

      The business has faced several challenges over the years such as a lack of finance and economic
      recessions. Elizabeth Sosa, managing partner, said that Hands survival depended not only on the
      product, but also on the craftswomen’s loyalty to the business and the partners’ democratic leadership
      style. She said “our workers have developed a strong sense of belonging to Hands. We are a team,
      everyone’s opinion is heard”.

      The partners wanted Hands to enter into international markets. They consulted with the craftswomen
      several times over this idea. Reaching a consensus on the decision took a long time. For Hands to
      compete effectively in international markets, some craftswomen would have to be given managerial
      authority. Many craftswomen expressed concern over these proposed organizational changes.

      Despite fierce competition from hand-knitting companies in India, New Zealand and Uruguay,
      within two years Hands had entered both the American and European markets by using high quality
      raw material and quality control methods. It now supplies its products to well-known companies
      and designers such as Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, and Polo Ralph Lauren. These new customers
      are outside the regional trading bloc Mercosur, where Hands is located, requiring new distribution
      channels. Consequently, Hands’ working capital needs have increased.

                                                [Used with permission.]



      (a)   Identify two features of quality control.                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain one advantage and two disadvantages to Hands of using a piece rate
            rewards package for its workers.                                                     [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse two challenges that Hands may have faced entering into international
            markets.                                                                             [5 marks]

      (d)   Evaluate the effectiveness of the democratic leadership style of the partners
            at Hands.                                                                            [7 marks]

4.    Peace Frogs (PF)

      Peace Frogs (PF) is an American company selling clothes and
      accessories that are branded by a frog making the “peace sign”.                              Content removed for
      PF specializes in teenage and young-adult clothing.                                          copyright reasons.

      The company started operations in 1985 with the sale of multi-coloured
      shorts designed after various national flags from around the world.
      Founder Catesby Jones chose the name Peace Frogs because the
      frog is a Native American (American Indian) symbol for peace and, in some cultures, a symbol for
      good luck. As the shorts reached maturity in the product life cycle, the company shifted to selling
      other items, always branded with the image of the “Peace Frog”.

      PF products include T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, swimsuits, stickers and other items. In 2007 the
      company introduced organic cotton T-shirts to its branded product line. The cotton meets rigorous
      organic certification standards. The T-shirts are made without using chemicals harmful to the
      environment. The company refuses to purchase clothing from manufacturers that employ children or
      who do not maintain rigorous safety standards.

      PF uses e-commerce and has its own retail stores in eleven American states. Since 1998 the company
      has had multi-coloured vans that drive to shopping centres, concerts and theme parks around the
      country. Drivers then sell PF branded products, using the van as a retail store.

      A concern among environmentalists is the decline in the number of species of frogs worldwide.
      At present, several species of frogs face extinction. The destruction of their natural habitat is the
      main threat for them. PF makes financial contributions to several organizations committed to
      environmental protection, which strengthens PF’s brand.

5.    Maquinaria de la Oficina de Santiago, Ltda. (MOS)

      Maquinaria de la Oficina de Santiago, Ltda. (Office Machinery
      of Santiago Ltd., MOS) is a private limited company run by
      Maria Salazar, who in 2009 became Chief Executive Officer
      (CEO) of the company after her father, Martino, retired.
      When Martino opened the business in 1959, he mainly sold
      typewriters*. Now MOS sells the following for personal and
      small business use:
      • modern mobile telephones (for example Apple iPhones)
      • portable DVD players
      • personal computers                                                                    [Image: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/
      • typewriters.                                                                                    File:Underwoodfive.jpg]

      Because of liquidity problems when she became CEO, Maria conducted a detailed analysis of sales
      and stock (inventory). She discovered the following:

                                % of            % of         Sales, 2011           % of         Average stock,
                                sales,          sales,          in $              stock,          2011 in $
                                2009            2011                               2011

       DVD players
       Personal                   55              50          6 000 000              50              304 000
       computers
       Typewriters                3               1             120 000              7                43 000
       Total                    100             100          12 000 000            100               608 000

      Maria concluded that MOS should stop selling typewriters, as they are at the end of their product
      life cycle. Reducing the stock of these items would release funds to help with the liquidity problem.

      The gross profit margin for the company on all products is 50 %, whereas for typewriters it is 60 %.

      Maria wants to modernize the image of MOS. She would like to change the name of the company
      to Electrónica Moderna de Santiago, Ltda. (Modern Electronics of Santiago Ltd.). Her father,
      a major shareholder in the company, dislikes the idea. He argues that too many loyal customers still
      use typewriters and that the company’s name is well-known in the Santiago business community.
      The legal and other costs of changing the name would use up all the funds released by the
      reduction in typewriter stock.



      * typewriters: machines for writing in letters and characters. Typewriters operate mechanically. Since the 1980s, the typewriter
            has become largely, though not entirely, obsolete because of the word processing function of computers


                                                                             (This question continues on the following page)
