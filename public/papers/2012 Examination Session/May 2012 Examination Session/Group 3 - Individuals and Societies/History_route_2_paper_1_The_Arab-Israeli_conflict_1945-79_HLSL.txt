Ironically Sadat’s search for peace and willingness to negotiate with Israel led to the Arab–Israeli war
of 1973. Shortly after Sadat succeeded Nasser he made contact with the Americans to test the waters
[check responses] in regard to realigning Egypt with the West and negotiating with Israel. Sadat believed
peace with Israel would allow him to regain the Sinai and result in a reduction of Egypt’s defence burden,
create stability at home and attract foreign investment and American aid.

He proposed a ceasefire and to re-open the Suez Canal and to negotiate on the basis of resolution 242.
Israel rejected these proposals and as a result Sadat started planning a war in order to persuade Israel to
make peace on terms acceptable to the Arabs and in order to attract the attention of the US which was
focused on Vietnam and détente at the time.

SOURCE C                Extract from The Near East Since the First World War: A History to 1995, by M. E.

The deadlock in the near east was broken by Egypt and Syria when they attacked Israel in October 1973.
Sadat had become convinced of the necessity of a limited war to persuade Israel to make peace on terms
that would be acceptable to the Arab world and to persuade the world to support a peace settlement.
Egypt was supported by Syria in the Golan Heights … and Saudi Arabia agreed to support an oil embargo.

During the first three days the war went well, Egypt seized the east bank of the Suez Canal and Syria broke
through in the Golan. Then Israel recovered; Syrian forces were pushed back and Egyptian forces were in
danger of being cut off by the Israeli advance. During the course of the 1973 war both superpowers had
supported their client states with fresh supplies of arms and diplomatic support. But they had also agreed
on concerted [joint] action through the UN to achieve a ceasefire.


SOURCE D                A History of the Arab Peoples by Albert Hourani, Faber & Faber, London, 1992.

In October 1973 Egypt launched a sudden attack on Israeli forces on the east bank of the Suez Canal at the
same moment, by agreement, the Syrians attacked Israel. The Egyptian army succeeded in establishing a
bridgehead on the east bank and the Syrians occupied parts of the Jawlan.

In the next few days the military tide turned, Israeli forces crossed the canal and also drove the Syrians
back towards Damascus. Their success was due to equipment sent by the Americans and partly due to
policy differences between Egypt and Syria …

But neither in the eyes of the Arabs nor those of the world did the war seem to be a defeat. They had attracted
sympathy and financial and military help from other Arab countries, it ended in a ceasefire imposed by the
superpowers which showed that while the US would not allow Israel to be defeated neither would it or the
USSR allow Egypt to be defeated.


SOURCE E                Used with permission.

The Security Council:
1.   calls upon all parties to the present fighting to cease all firing and terminate all military activity
     immediately, no later than 12 hours after the adoption of this decision; in the positions they now occupy.

2.    calls upon the parties concerned to start immediately after the ceasefire the implementation of Security
      Council resolution 242 in all of its parts.

3.    decides that, immediately and concurrently with the ceasefire, negotiations start between the parties
      concerned under the appropriate auspices aimed at establishing a just, durable peace in the Middle East.
