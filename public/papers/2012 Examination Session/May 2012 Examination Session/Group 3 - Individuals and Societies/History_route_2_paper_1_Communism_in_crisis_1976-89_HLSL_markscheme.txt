work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What does Source A suggest about Hua Guofeng’s (Hua Kuo-Feng’s)
           weaknesses?                                                                     [3 marks]

            Hua attempted to take a middle road which did not satisfy either of the rival factions;
            Hua appeared contradictory in criticising the Gang of Four but praising the Cultural
             Revolution;
            He continued to associate himself with Maoist models for agriculture and industry
             with high targets;
            He lacked the political skill, experience and ruthless determination of Deng.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                       [2 marks]

            The Gang of Four had lost popularity at the time/were no longer trusted;
            Each member of the Gang of Four had been accused of a counter-revolutionary
             activity; four different counter-revolutionary attributes are detailed: nationalist spy,
             bourgeois, traitor and anti-proletarian;
            Gang of Four depicted not working together/lack of unity.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about the
     struggle for power following the death of Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung).                [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources suggest strengths of Hua;
      Both Source C and Source D refer to the fact that the arrest of the Gang of Four was swift;
      Both documents talk negatively of Lin Piao (Lin Biao);
      Both identify divisions/disunity within the party.

     For “contrast”
      Source C implies that Hua benefited from being Mao’s heir, whereas Source D claims that
       being Mao’s heir was becoming a liability;
      Source C suggests Mao’s policies will continue, whereas Source D indicates that China
       was moving away from Mao’s policies;
      Source C focuses on central role of the party but focus of Source D is the role of
       individuals;
      Source C suggests factions have been overcome, for example victory over the Gang of
       Four, whereas in D divisions are unresolved, power struggle continues;
      Source D suggests importance of Deng but Deng is not mentioned in Source C.

      End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
      element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources
      are used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum
      of [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
      comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
      [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source B for historians studying the struggle for power
     following the death of Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung).                                     [6 marks]

     Source A:
     Origin:        This is from China Against the Tides by Marc Blecher, professor of Politics
                    and East Asian Studies at Oberlin College, Ohio, USA, published in 2010.

     Purpose:       Its purpose is to present a recent political history of China from an academic
                    viewpoint.

     Value:         As Blecher is a professional academic and an expert in East Asian studies his
                    work is likely to be well researched, making use of a range of sources
                    Sufficient time will have elapsed in relation to this particular period for him to
                    have had the benefit of hindsight.

     Limitations:   Full evidence on the subject may still not be available due to censorship in
                    China. The author may have a western perspective of China.

     Source B:
     Origin:        This is from The New Emperors by Harrison E Salisbury, published in London
                    in 1992, author and one-time Moscow correspondent for the New York Times.

     Purpose:       Salisbury’s aim will be to convey his view of modern Chinese leaders to his
                    readership.

     Value:         He will have had the benefit of hindsight by 1992. As he had been a foreign
                    correspondent based in Moscow he may have a sound understanding of the
                    politics of communist states.

     Limitations:   Salisbury may not be a trained historian. Full evidence on the subject maybe
                    limited due to censorship in China. As he had been a correspondent in
                    Moscow he may have been influenced by the Soviet perspective on China.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree
     that the weaknesses of others aided Deng Xiaoping’s (Teng Hsiao-p’ing’s)
     rise to power?                                                                     [8 marks]

     Source A:     This source outlines some of Hua’s weaknesses: Hua attempted to take a
                   middle road which did not satisfy either of the rival factions, he continued to
                   associate himself with Maoist ideas and he lacked determination, experience
                   and political support. Deng’s relative political strengths and determination are
                   highlighted.

     Source B:     This source shows how Jiang Qing [Chiang Ch’ing] was not trusted by Mao
                   which was a weakness for the Gang of Four. Media reports designed to
                   damage Deng had had the opposite effect.

     Source C:     This source suggests that the Gang of Four was quickly eliminated. It outlines
                   Hua’s focus on the gang of four and Lin Piao [Lin Biao] in first phase of the
                   power struggle. The idea that the party has overcome its divisions and Hua is
                   in a position of strength is presented.

     Source D:     This source also shows how the Gang of Four was quickly eliminated from
                   the contest. Mao had chosen Hua as his successor, initially identified as a
                   strength but this is later seen as a weakness. Deng’s political skill is shown,
                   in blaming Lin Biao and the Gang of Four and not Mao for “excesses”.

     Source E:     This source shows how the different members of the Gang of Four were
                   perceived in March 1977 and consequently that they had lost any popularity
                   they may have had.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: contestants’ attitudes to economic reform and improved
     foreign relations. The activities of the contestants during the Cultural Revolution could be
     discussed to highlight strengths and weaknesses. There may be brief explanation as to the
     role of the Gang of Four after Mao’s death and why they were eliminated so quickly from the
     leadership contest. There may be further development of Hua’s and Deng’s relative strengths
     and weaknesses for example, military support shifting after the removal of the Gang of Four,
     Deng’s economic experience – development of “four modernizations” and Deng’s foreign
     policy experience e.g. leading delegations to Japan and USA. Resolutions at Third Plenum in
     December, 1978.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
