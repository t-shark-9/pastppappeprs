Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is well
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

Colonialism in South and Southeast Asia and Oceania — late eighteenth to the mid nineteenth
century

1.   Compare and contrast the reasons for, and the effects of, colonial rule from the late
     eighteenth century until the mid nineteenth century in two of the following: Indo-China; the
     Philippines; Indonesia; Australia; New Zealand.

     Candidates may first identify and discuss what they consider to be the main reasons why imperial
     powers established their rule in two countries. These may include: strategic reasons; trade and
     commerce; increasing industrialisation in Europe and the desire for new markets as well as the
     search for raw materials; and emigration and settlement schemes. Candidates will also need to
     examine the effects of colonial rule in these two countries. This may include an examination of the
     impact of the imperial powers’ presence: the political structure; the type of rule, direct or indirect;
     the structure of the bureaucracy; the economy, including land distribution and the effect on local
     agriculture; trade and commerce; the lifestyles of the colonial masters; the presence and activities of
     missionaries; further immigration, particularly in the mid nineteenth century; and the attempt to
     replicate the society and institutions of the mother country. The official policies towards the
     indigenous/colonial people may be compared and contrasted, but also how these were implemented:
     the way the imperial powers may have handled rebellions and resistance; and the level of violence
     used to control the colonized people. Answers may focus on the military strengths and the
     technological advancement of the colonizers. Candidates may identify the relative popularity of the
     rule of the imperialist powers in some sectors of the indigenous/colonial population. The colonial
     powers’ policies of divide and rule and the diversity of some societies such as religious and ethnic
     differences made unified resistance more difficult. There are a few examples where revolts and
     resistance occurred. There was resistance to the Dutch in Java in 1825. In the Philippines there
     was a steady resistance on a small scale ever since the arrival of the Spanish: the Palaris Revolt of
     1762–1765 was the largest revolt and then the Ambaristo Revolt in 1807. The Spanish policies of
     repression both helped cause as well as curb resistance in the Philippines.

     For Australia: there were six colonies established, each for different reasons; South Australia was
     the only one free of convict transportation; there were no formal treaties with the indigenous people.
     For New Zealand: it was initially considered part of New South Wales until 1841; the 1840 Treaty
     of Waitangi was a formal treaty with Maoris, but there was the First Maori War (1843–1848).
     Essentially, these two became European settler societies.

     Answers may focus on comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified.

     If only reasons or effects is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

     If only one colony is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

2.   ―The Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) of 1857 was a turning point in the British administration
     of India.‖ To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates may initially establish how India was governed before the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny)
     of 1857, but the main focus of the response should be on whether there was significant change in
     the way the British governed India afterwards. Prior to the Great Revolt the British administration
     was essentially the operations of the British East India Company under the auspices of the Crown
     rather than a colonial settlement. Candidates may refer to differing polices of various
     Governor-Generals: Wellesley created subsidiary alliances with the princes; Bentinck’s “reforms”
     included the abolition of sati and thuggee, marriage reform and the extension of education;
     Dalhousie introduced the Doctrine of Lapse which annexed the princely states without heirs.
     The economic changes such as the opening of India to free trade had a negative impact on native
     industry and production; land reform and land taxation also caused difficulties for Indian peasants.
     The nature of the administration was paternalistic. British policies could all be considered as being
     aimed at extending and consolidating British trade. After the Great Revolt, the British East India
     Company was abolished and the British government took direct control of areas previously
     administered by it and established indirect control over the princely states. The Government of
     India Act 1858 created a new British government office and the Governor-General became the
     Viceroy and was answerable to the Secretary of State for India. The nature of the relationship
     between the British and Indians changed and, although the British became increasingly more
     socially elitist, the government policy aimed to involve Indians in administration and this led to the
     opening of entry into the Indian Civil Service. There was a growth in secular education, including
     universities, for Indians and the rise of a new Indian middle class and intelligentsia. Religious
     tolerance was decreed. The changes in infrastructure and communications contributed to the
     increase in prosperity for some and to a growing sense of Indian national identity. Candidates
     should make some assessment of the extent to which the Great Revolt was a turning point.

Traditional East Asian societies — late eighteenth to the mid nineteenth century

3.   To what extent did the outcome of the First Opium War contribute to the causes of the
     Second Opium War?

     Candidates may start by discussing the Treaty of Nanjing (Nanking) in 1842 and list the conditions:
     indemnity payments; abolition of the Canton system of trade; five treaty ports opened to the trade
     and residence of British officials and traders; Hong Kong was ceded to Britain; equality in status
     between British and Chinese officials recognized; a fixed tariff was established. This was followed
     by the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue in 1843 which also included most favoured nation status
     for Britain; extra-territoriality; allowed the presence of British warships in the treaty ports. In 1844,
     the Treaty of Wangxia (Wanghsia) with the United States was signed: banned the US opium trade;
     granted extra-territoriality; the right to maintain churches and hospitals in the treaty ports; a most
     favoured nation clause; and treaty revision in twelve years. The Treaty of Huangpu (Whampoa)
     with France was also in 1844 and this added the right to freely spread Catholicism. Candidates will
     need to examine whether the grievances of the Western powers that led to the First Opium War
     were satisfied by these treaties. The impact on China will also need to be assessed: humiliation;
     decay of the Qing dynasty; effects of the continuation of the opium trade; refusal to appreciate the
     cultural differences between China and the West; different commercial needs. Sino–Western
     relations deteriorated further between 1849 and 1856 due to a number of issues: the entry of the
     British into Guangzhou (Canton) city; foreign desire to extend trade beyond the five treaty ports;
     foreign demands for tariff revision; the request to establish foreign legations in Beijing (Peking);
     the Western desire for treaty revision; the coolie trade. The Arrow incident in 1856 was the catalyst
     that led to the Second Opium War. Candidates will need to come to a conclusion about the extent
     to which the Second Opium War was caused by the outcome of the First Opium War.


4.   In what ways, and to what extent, was the Tokugawa Shogunate’s authority undermined by
     forces from within Japan before the arrival of Commodore Perry in 1853?

     Candidates may discuss the nature of the isolation policy (shakoku) of the Tokugawa Shogunate and
     should show knowledge and understanding of how, by the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
     centuries after a long period of peace, internal changes in Japanese society challenged the
     Shogunate’s authority. Expect reference to the powerful Western tozama clans (Satsuma, Choshu,
     Hizen and Tosa) originally defeated at the beginning of the Tokugawa period; the rising cost of the
     alternative attendance of the daimyo; the changing social and economic status of the merchants and
     the samurai; the internal expansion of trade and commerce; currency changes; famine; debt;
     increased taxation; the increase in peasant rebellions; the floating world (ukiyo) and the counter
     culture. The Japanese had contact with Europe only through the Dutch trading factory at Deshima
     in Nagasaki harbour. By the nineteenth century this contact had prompted the rise of Dutch
     Learning (rangaku) amongst the samurai and this created an awareness that scientific and
     technological developments in the West posed a challenge to Japan. The social and economic
     changes had weakened the traditional feudal structures which supported the Tokugawa Shogunate
     and the National Learning (kokgaku) school of thought called for a restoration of the Emperor.
     Increasing pressure came from the Western powers, particularly Britain, Russia and the United
     States, for trade and some of the tozama clans already had some limited trade with them. Some
     assessment of the extent to which the Shogunate’s authority had been undermined is needed.
     Mention of the arrival of Commodore Perry and the opening of Japan to the West are relevant only
     in the context of an analysis of the weakness of the Shogunate’s rule.

     If only “ways” or “to what extent” is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Developing identities — mid nineteenth to early twentieth century

5.   Analyse the factors that contributed to the growth of national identity between the late
     nineteenth century and early twentieth century in one of the following: the Philippines;
     Australia; New Zealand.

     For the Philippines candidates may choose initially to discuss some factors that contributed to the
     growth of national identity during nineteenth century. Throughout the century there was increasing
     tension between the native born Filipinos of Spanish descent and the Spanish administrators of the
     colony. This led to many disputes: in the Church over the appointment of clergy; in the military
     there was the Cavite Mutiny in 1872 when the native born soldiers protested about a new tax.
     The Cavite Mutiny was put down brutally and the leaders were executed. The Spanish
     Governor-General’s intent was to crush the growth of Filipino nationalism. Some intellectuals of
     mixed descent were also drawn to the Filipino nationalist movement. Candidates may then identify
     the roles of various nationalist leaders who contributed to the growth of national identity at the end
     of the nineteenth century. Candidates may look at their beliefs about how independence should be
     achieved; their actions; and their deaths. Jose Rizal gained a reputation as a writer and poet. His
     1887 novel, Noli Me Tangere, described Filipino suffering under Spanish rule. He became a
     dedicated reformer, writing articles for La Solidaridad, the journal published by the Propaganda
     Movement, organized by Filipinos in Spain who wanted greater liberty for the Philippines. His
     second novel, El Filibusterismo, raised the question of revolution without advocating it. He
     returned from Spain in 1892, founded the Filipino League, an organization advocating peaceful
     reform, was arrested by the Spanish authorities and sent to Mindanao. In 1896, the Spanish
     authorities ordered the arrest of revolutionary leaders, sparking revolt. Although not involved in the
     revolt, Rizal was arrested, tried for treason and executed, making him a nationalist martyr. Andres
     Bonficiao was another leader, who initially joined Rizal’s Filipino League, but he became
     disillusioned and abandoned the idea of a peaceful struggle and founded the Katipunan in 1892, a
     secret society dedicated to rebellion. He also published his ideas and supported the Revolution
     which began in 1896. The Katipunan split into two groups and leadership conflicts between Emilo
     Aguinaldo and Bonifacio culminated in the execution of Bonifacio in 1897. Aguinaldo and his
     followers surrendered to the authorities and went into exile in Hong Kong. In the meantime the
     Spanish-American War broke out. Aguinaldo became the President of the First Philippine Republic
     returned to the Philippines and led resistance to the Americans in the Philippine-American War,
     1899–1902. The United States took control of the Philippines until 1935, but in this time
     introduced the Philippine Assembly in 1907 and promised independence.
                                                 –8–               M12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M


     For Australia or New Zealand candidates may choose initially to analyse the factors that contributed
     to the growth of national identity before the First World War. In Australia: the movement towards
     and the achievement of Federation in 1901; the celebration of Australia’s uniqueness with reference
     to the flora and fauna; the adoption of the bushman image despite the fact that most people lived in
     towns and cities; the art and writing of this period; the different strands of nationalism, radical
     republicanism and dual loyalty to both Australia and the British Empire. In New Zealand a similar
     set of factors and sentiments prevailed: involvement in the Boer War; granting of Dominion status
     in 1907; the rugged and enterprising man alone versus nature; egalitarianism; double patriotism;
     cultural nationalism. The impact of Australia’s or New Zealand’s involvement in the First World
     War on the growth of national identity may then be discussed. For both: the initial enthusiasm for
     the war; the idea that Gallipoli was a defining moment in nationhood, for Australia “Baptism by
     fire” and for New Zealand “Baptism of blood”; the soldiers come to represent the typical Australian
     or New Zealander in uniform with his values of resourcefulness and mateship; war correspondents
     and cartoonists popularized this image. Despite the fact that the Gallipoli campaign ended in
     withdrawal, the Anzac legend came to symbolize Australia’s or New Zealand’s involvement in the
     First World War and subsequent wars and Anzac Day became a public holiday and de facto national
     day. After the war, in both countries, the sense of national identity was now linked with
     commemoration and remembrance and it became part of a conservative imperialist nationalism in
     the 1920s; an example of this was the establishment of returned servicemen’s associations which
     became the keepers of the legend.


6.   Explain why the Siamese monarchy was able to maintain its independence from full European
     control up to the end of the First World War.

     Candidates should be aware of the role and importance of the characters and policies of King
     Mongkut (1851–1868), King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910) and King Vajiravudh (1910–1925) in
     respect to Thailand retaining its independence from European rule. The Thai government was able
     to survive through a combination of good government and diplomacy until the height of European
     imperialism had passed. The reasons may include the policies of these monarchs to modernize the
     state; introduce reform measures; and make concessions of the less important areas of Siam to
     French and British interests. They realised that to ensure the survival of Thai independence
     modernisation was crucial and they were strategic enough to use Western advisers to help in this
     process. These reforms targeted the structure of government administration; promoted commerce;
     expanded transport and communications infrastructure; and developed education. The diplomatic
     agreements established Siam as a neutral area between the British territories of Burma and Malaya
     and French Indochina. Details about this diplomacy may include the treaty between Siam and Great
     Britain in 1855, which established terms favouring British trade and representation. In 1893, Siam
     signed a similar treaty with France and, in 1907, ceded the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap
     to France. In 1909, Siam ceded the provinces of Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Trengganu to Britain
     (today these are part of Malaysia). In 1917, the Siamese willingness to participate in the First
     World War strengthened the bonds of friendship between Siam, France and Great Britain. These
     territorial concessions were made by Siam in order to maintain its independence.

Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia — mid nineteenth to early twentieth century

7.   Analyse the reasons for, and the consequences of, the Boxer Rebellion (1900–1901) in China.

     Many candidates may use Immanuel Hsu’s overall analysis of why the Boxer Rebellion occurred:
     strong anti-foreign sentiment; national humiliation; antipathy towards Christianity and its spread;
     public anger about Western imperialism, particularly after the scramble for concessions of the late
     1890s; economic hardship caused by foreign domination of trade, domestic markets and industrial
     expansion; and natural disasters. The Boxers or the “Society of Harmonious Fists” originally
     emerged in Shandong (Shantung) province. They had links with earlier anti-Qing (anti-Ch’ing)
     secret societies, but by the late 1890s they had become pro-Qing (pro-Ch’ing) and anti-foreign
     militias, with the encouragement of the conservative Manchu Governors of the province. These
     governors were replaced due to foreign pressure and Yuan Shikai (Yuan Shih-K’ai) suppressed the
     Boxers in December 1899, but by 1900 the Empress Dowager, Cixi (Tz’u-hsu), and reactionary
     Manchu officials endorsed them. The Boxers advanced towards Beijing and demonstrated their
     hatred of foreign intervention by killing Christian missionaries and their converts and destroying
     railways and telegraph lines. They received considerable support along the way and in Beijing they
     besieged the foreign embassies. Amidst the chaos Cixi (Tz’u-hsu) and the Qing (Ch’ing) court fled
     to Xian (Sian). Foreign governments, including Japan, sent troops, lifted the siege and forced on
     the Chinese the humiliating Boxer Protocol. China had to pay huge indemnities; lost territory; a
     two year ban on the importation and manufacture of armaments was imposed; and its sovereignty
     was violated in that the forts could not be rebuilt, officials were to be punished, memorials had to be
     erected, the examination system was abolished, foreign troops were stationed indefinitely in Beijing
     (Peking) and other places to protect Western interests. Wider consequences include: the Late Qing
     Reform Movement that attempted to implement administrative, educational, military and
     constitutional changes; the railway recovery movement; the re-emergence of anti-Qing sentiment;
     and the growth of revolutionary attitudes, including Sun Yixian’s (Sun Yat-sen’s) Alliance League
     or Tongmenghui (T’ung-meng hui). Some candidates may argue that the 1911 Double Tenth
     Nationalist Revolution was a long-term consequence of the Boxer Rebellion. Others may mention
     that it contributed to the later warlordism because of the division amongst provincial leaders about
     how to handle the Boxers. Award discussion based upon historical evidence.

     If only reasons or consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

8.   Examine the causes, and the consequences for Korea and the region, of the Sino–Japanese
     War (1894–1895).

     Candidates may initially discuss the causes of the Sino–Japanese War. The rapidly industrializing
     and modernizing Meiji Japan was interested in Korea as a possible future possession: in order to
     emulate the imperialist nature of the Western powers; as a source of raw materials; as a steady
     market for Japanese exports; as a “granary” to feed the rising Japanese population; for protection
     from an expanding Russia; for strategic advantages in dealing with both Russia and China. Japan
     forced Korea to open its ports in 1876 with the Treaty of Kanghwa. Japan recognized Korea as an
     independent state, but Korea still considered itself to be under Chinese control. Within the Korean
     government different factions favoured either China or Japan. On several occasions prior to 1894
     Japan had sent troops to Korea to protect their interests. The presence of troops from both countries
     to help suppress the Tonghak Rebellion was the catalyst for the outbreak of war. Initially, China
     was expected to win the war, but Japanese modernisation in the decades prior to the war had been
     more thorough than China’s and its armed forces and their command were more efficient. Even so,
     Japan was ready to make peace in 1895 because of the economic effects of the war. China’s
     traditional claim to superiority had been decisively discredited. The Treaty of Shimonoseki was
     unequal in Japan’s favour with China being forced to concede territory, pay an indemnity, open new
     ports to Japanese trade and recognize the independence of Korea. The Treaty also gave Japan more
     trading ports in Korea. Japan began to dominate the internal politics of Korea. The Japanese
     murdered Empress Min who had sought Russian help. The Treaty of Portsmouth following the
     Russo–Japanese War (1904–1905) recognized Japan’s political, economic and military interests in
     Korea. Finally, Japan formally annexed Korea in 1910. Candidates need also to discuss the
     consequences for the region. In1894 the major powers in the region were Britain, France, the
     United States and Russia. The Triple Intervention in 1895 of Russia, France and Germany forced
     Japan to return the Liaodong (Liaotung) Peninsula to China. This indicated that Russia, in
     particular, was feeling threatened by Japan. After the Sino–Japanese War the balance of power had
     shifted towards Japan, to the extent that Britain saw it as a useful potential ally against her
     traditional rival, Russia. The Anglo–Japanese alliance of 1902 suited both Japan and Britain, but
     Japan was not regarded as an equal. The war with Russia in 1904–1905 further upset Western
     interests, because the defeat of Russia left Japan dominant in Northeast Asia.

     Weaker candidates may be fairly general about the consequences but better candidates should be
     specific about the consequences for both Korea and the region.

     If only causes or consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Impact of the World Wars on South and Southeast Asia to the mid twentieth century

9.   Evaluate the contribution of one leader to the achievement of independence for one country in
     South Asia between the end of the First World War and the mid twentieth century.

     Popular choices will probably be Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru for India or Jinnah for
     Pakistan.

     Gandhi
     Candidates may start by discussing his involvement in the Indian nationalist movement. This may
     include: Gandhi’s ideas and philosophy; first satyagraha campaign 1917; second and third
     satyagraha campaigns; Gandhi’s support for the Khilafat issue; his continuation of non-cooperation;

     Nehru; the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935 and those for and against; the impact of the
     Second World War; the role of Jinnah and the revival of the All India Muslim League; Gandhi’s

     government in Britain; Wavell and Mountbatten. Candidates will need to come to a conclusion as
     to how effective or otherwise Gandhi’s contribution was to the achievement of Indian independence
     in 1947. Better candidates may make distinction between Gandhi’s popular and symbolic appeal
     and the actual political process.

     Nehru
     Candidates may start by discussing his involvement in the Indian nationalist movement. This may
     include: his interest in Gandhi’s ideas and philosophy; his involvement in non-cooperation
     campaigns; his arrest and imprisonment by the British nine times; his role as Secretary of the United
     Provinces Congress Committee 1926–1928; his demand for full independence rather than Dominion
     status; his presidency of the Congress Party in 1929, 1936, 1937 and 1946; his involvement in the
     1942 Quit India Campaign; the part he played in the final negotiations with Wavell and
     Mountbatten. The importance of his contribution needs to be evaluated in the light of other factors
     which may have also contributed to the achievement of Indian independence in 1947. These may
     include: Nehru’s relationship with Gandhi; actions of other members of Congress; the role of his
     father, Motilal Nehru; the Government of India Acts 1919 and 1935 and those for and against; the
     impact of the Second World War; the role of Jinnah and the revival of the All India Muslim League;
     the demands for the creation of a separate Muslim state; Nehru’s relationship with Jinnah; the
     change of government in Britain after the Second World War. Nehru became India’s first Prime
     Minister on 15 August 1947. Candidates will need to come to a conclusion as to how significant
     Nehru’s contribution was in the achievement of Indian independence.

Jinnah
The role of Jinnah is of great importance in the creation of the independent state of Pakistan.
Candidates may start by discussing his life and political career and they should put it into the
context of the events in India at the time. Jinnah was initially an active member of the Indian
National Congress as well as joining the All India Muslim League in 1913. He was a supporter of
inclusive Indian nationalism, but in the 1920s he moved away from that position. The 1928 Nehru
Report did not endorse the continuation of separate Muslim electorates and it fuelled Muslim fears
about Hindu domination. During the late 1920s and early 1930s the relationship between Hindus
and Muslims deteriorated. In 1930 the President of the League, Iqbal, proposed the idea of a
separate Muslim state and his Two Nation Theory gained support. Jinnah became disillusioned
with politics and left India to practice law in Britain. He returned in 1935 to lead the League. The
importance of his contribution needs to be evaluated in the light of other factors which may have
also contributed to partition and the achievement of Pakistan’s independence in 1947. These may
include: the Government of India Act 1935 and those for and against; the role of Congress and
Nehru; the impact of the Second World War; the post-war change of government in Britain. The
League’s Lahore Resolution was adopted in 1940, and its principles formed the foundation for
Pakistan’s first constitution. During the Cripps mission in 1942, Jinnah demanded parity between
the number of Congress and League ministers, the League’s exclusive right to appoint Muslims and
a right for Muslim-majority provinces to secede, leading to the breakdown of talks. Jinnah
supported the British effort in the Second World War, and opposed the Indian National Congress’
Quit India Movement. Gandhi’s vision of an inclusive and united India may be mentioned. Talks
between Jinnah and Gandhi in 1944 failed to achieve agreement and this was the last attempt to
reach a single-state solution. Jinnah became Pakistan’s first Governor-General on 15 August 1947.
Candidates will need to come to a conclusion as to how significant Jinnah’s contribution was in the
achievement of Pakistan’s independence.

10.   Compare and contrast the impact of both the First World War and the Second World War on
      Indonesia and Vietnam.
      Candidates may initially discuss the way in which the First World War was a catalyst for the fledging
      nationalist movements in both Indonesia and Vietnam. A distinction may be made between the earlier
      resistance movements aimed at the foreign colonizers and the twentieth century goals to forge new
      nations. There are comparisons between Indonesia and Vietnam, which include repression and
      economic exploitation by the European colonial power, but also contrasts because in Indonesia religion
      played a significant role in the development of the nationalist movement and the Dutch tolerated more
      dissent than the French. In Indonesia the vast majority of the population was Muslim and in 1911
      Sarekat Islam was founded. Dutch creation of the Volksraad did not satisfy Indonesian nationalism,
      fanned by the effects of the First World War and the Russian Revolution of 1917. In 1918 Sarekat
      Islam adopted a socialist programme. In 1920 Semaun and Darsono formed the PKI or Communist
      Party of the Indies. PKI members were expelled from Sarekat Islam. The latter campaigned against the
      suppression of Indonesians, and Islamic ideology became the foundation of its political struggle. A PKI
      revolt in 1926 was crushed. Nationalist support turned to the Indonesian National Party (PNI) founded
      by Sukarno in 1927. Sukarno and other leaders were arrested in 1929 and the party banned in 1931. On
      his release in 1931 Sukarno formed the Indonesia Party (Partindo) but was exiled to New Guinea in
      1933. In 1934 Sarekat Islam split between Muslim conservatives and socialists. Moderate nationalists
      attempted to work through the Volksraad but their calls for a transition to independence were rejected.
      In 1939 they formed the Gobongan Politek Indonesia (GAPI).

      Vietnam was the most important colony in Indo-China and French policies concentrated on the
      consolidation of political authority, assimilation and economic exploitation. Prior to the First World
      War there were numerous resistance groups and uprisings. Ho Chi Minh was influenced by the First
      World War and the Russian Revolution and in 1925 he created the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth
      League in China. This put him into conflict with an early leader, Phan Boi Chau, who was influenced
      by Sun Yatsen’s ideas, and whom he betrayed to the French authorities. In 1927 another group, the Viet
      Nam Quoc Dan Dang (VNQDD), modelled on the Guomindang, was formed and it led violent protests,
      but was crushed by the French in 1930. Ho Ch Minh founded the Indochinese Communist Party and
      they developed peasant support throughout the 1930s. A communist led coalition of Vietnamese
      nationalists, the Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh (Vietnamese Independence League), known as the Viet
      Minh, was formed by Ho Chi Minh in 1941 with the aim of fighting both the French and the Japanese.

      The Second World War and Japanese occupation may be seen as a watershed with the pre-war period
      of colonial rule where the nationalist movements initially developed. Although the nationalist
      movements in Indonesia and Vietnam did not follow exactly the same path there are some common
      themes. The Japanese expansion into both countries and the nature of the occupation will need to be
      examined. This may include: Japanese atrocities; resistance to Japanese rule; the way the Japanese
      used the colonial administration of both countries which were occupied by the Nazis; the
      opportunities for nationalists to acquire experience in administration and in the military; the impact of
      Japanese ideas such as “Asia for the Asians”; Japanese support for independence from Western
      colonial rule; the immediate declaration of independence after the defeat of the Japanese in an attempt
      to pre-empt the return of the colonial power; the subsequent struggle with the colonial power until the
      final achievement of independence. Candidates may also compare and contrast the roles of the
      charismatic nationalist leaders: Sukarno (Indonesia) and Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam).

      Many answers will focus on comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified.

      There does not need to be an equal amount of material on both wars, bit if only one war is discussed
      mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

The Republic of China 1912–1949 and the rise of Communism

11.   Why did the First United Front (1924–1927) between the Chinese Communist Party and the
      Guomindang (Kuomintang) fail?

      Candidates may initially identify the reasons for First United Front. The Chinese Communist Party
      (CCP) was formed in 1921 and this fledging party was supported by the Comintern. Sun Yixian
      (Sun Yat-sen) started to reorganize the Guomindang (Kuomintang) in 1923 and entered into
      negotiations with the Soviet Union for aid. The 1923 Sun-Joffe Declaration agreed that whilst
      Communism would not be substituted for Sun’s Three Principles, there were certain shared aims for
      the GMD and the CCP. These included nationalism, ridding China of foreign domination,
      socialism, defeat of the warlords and the establishment of a unified government for China. Despite
      some objections the CCP members were ordered by Comintern to join with the GMD. Both parties
      differed about the ultimate form of government for China and they used the First United Front to
      further their own goals. The CCP members had to join the GMD as individuals and they could see
      the value of being part of a stronger party. The CCP and Comintern believed that the GMD could
      be subverted from within. Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) was fairly idealistc and he wanted to utilize
      the CCP’s support among the peasantry and workers to gain popular support. The GMD felt that
      this would give impetus to the military advance against the warlords in the North. The CCP saw the
      opportunities created by the Northern advance to spread their ideology among the people. Support
      for the GMD came largely from the urban areas and the commercial classes. After Sun’s death in
      1925, tensions between the left and right factions within the GMD developed and Jiang Jieshi
      (Chiang Kai-shek) became leader and military commander. Tensions were developing between the
      CCP members and the GMD over the issue of dual membership and the Communists’ influence
      within the organisation. Resolutions were passed to limit the number of official positions they
      could hold. Stalin ordered the CCP members to accept this and remain in the GMD. The Northern
      Expedition 1926–1927 was successful and with the capture of Shanghai, Jiang gained access to the
      wealth and influence of the powerful business interests who were opposed to the trade union
      movements. With their support he turned on the Communists in the 1927 White Terror and the
      surviving CCP members fled to the countryside. Candidates may note that the purge of the
      Communists signified the failure of the First United Front despite Stalin continuing to support it.
      Candidates may conclude the failure was to due to each party having its own agenda and that failure
      was the most likely outcome even if Jiang had not struck first. Some candidates may also examine
      the role of the leaders of each party and of the Comintern in the eventual failure.

      Award credit for reasoned discussion based upon historical evidence. Candidates will need to come
      to a conclusion about why the First United front failed.

12.   ―The main reason why the Guomindang (Kuomintang) lost the Chinese Civil War
      (1946–1949) to the Communists was that they were exhausted after fighting the Japanese in
      the Sino–Japanese War (1937–1945).‖ To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates may initially discuss the situation at the end of the Sino–Japanese War. The Second
      United Front collapsed during the Sino–Japanese War (1937–1945) and the Guomindang
      (Kuomintang) and the Chinese Communist Party forces each had control of different areas of
      China. The United States supported Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) to accept the Japanese
      surrender. Marshall, on behalf of the US government, attempted to reconcile the two parties, but
      the talks broke down and the Civil War began in 1946. Despite their military superiority, US aid
      and their early victories the GMD (KMT) soon lost ground. Candidates may identify a variety of
      reasons: the narrow urban GMD (KMT) support base; the authoritarian nature of Jiang’s
      government; the corruption; the harsh treatment of the people; demoralized troops and mass
      defections; the failure to achieve Sun Yixian’s (Sun Yat-sen’s) Three Principles; the lack of
      political, economic and social reforms; and the withdrawal of effective US aid. On the other hand,
      the Sino–Japanese War had enabled the CCP to spread their influence and it had improved their
      military position, though initially the Red Army was smaller and less well-equipped. Other factors
      that may be considered are: the CCP’s ideological appeal based on their pro-peasant policies in the
      areas they controlled; their promises of land reform; their high morale; strong leadership; their
      freedom from corruption; their effective propaganda; Nationalist troop defections to the Red Army
      and the capture of much GMD (KMT) military equipment during the latter stages of the Civil War;
      and the favourable impression they had made upon Western journalists and observers. Mid 1947
      was a turning point in the progress of the Civil War with the Red Army going on the offensive and
      winning several significant victories by January 1949 when Mao entered Beijing (Peking). Many
      candidates may use Immanuel Hsu’s overall analysis to structure their response: the deceptive
      impression of Nationalist military strength, war weariness and failures in Nationalist strategy;
      inflation and economic collapse; loss of public confidence and respect; the failure of American
      mediation and aid; and the retardation of social and economic reforms.

      Candidates will need to address the question and discussion that is solely based on events in the
      1930s should not score highly.

Imperial Japan: empire and aftermath 1912–1952

13.   Evaluate the influence of the army on Japanese politics in the period 1927–1937.

      Candidates may initially mention that during the 1920s Japan appeared to be developing as a liberal
      democracy. Universal male suffrage in 1925 introduced into political life a mass electorate which
      could assert influence at elections and was open to manipulation by nationalistic and militaristic
      politicians and spokesmen for expansionist policies. Various army reforms also made access to
      officer ranks easier for young men of the urban and rural lower middle classes. Tanaka Giichi
      became Prime Minister in 1927 and he was pressured by the army to adopt more aggressive
      policies to protect Japanese interests in Manchuria in the face of the advance of Jiang Jieshi’s
      (Chiang Kai-shek’s) Northern Expedition. This led to the assassination of Zhang Zoulin
      (Chang Tso-lin) in Manchuria in 1928. Tanaka was forced to resign due to the Emperor’s
      disapproval, but the influence of the army continued to increase. The collapse of the world
      economy in 1929 had a great impact on Japan and the new electorate turned against the often
      corrupt civilian politicians. There was opposition in Japan to the government’s acceptance of the
      terms of the Washington Naval Conference in 1930. The rise of militarism and of political
      conservatism with its return to traditional Japanese values encouraged the invasion of Manchuria in
      1931 and the creation of Manchuko in 1932 as a means of acquiring land for Japan’s crowded
      population, minerals for its industries and a safe field for investment. There was also the attack on
      Shanghai in 1932 and Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1933. During the early 1930s
      there was a struggle in the army between the radical Koda-ha or Imperial Way faction and the
      Tosei-ha or Control Way faction of older more conservative officers. This led to a number of
      political assassinations and attempted military coups. The failed coup of 26 February 1936 routed
      the Imperial Way faction and the Control faction dominated the army and exerted power in politics.
      Under Prime Minister Hirota Koki the civilian element in the government was weakened. After this
      Japan turned to rearmament to encourage its industries; there was a revival of nationalism based on
      the military and the Emperor; strict control of education was introduced; the Anti-Comintern Pact
      with Hitler was signed in 1936; and there was a push for expansion into China for raw materials and
      markets. Opposition from the Diet proved ineffectual and war with China started in 1937.

14.   Explain why, and with what success, Japan established the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the region
      between 1940 and 1945.

      Candidates may identify a number of factors that gave rise to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity
      Sphere. Japan had suffered from the effects of the Great Depression in the early 1930s and the
      failure of the rice crop in 1931. Both led to a desire for expansion into China and Southeast Asia
      for raw materials and markets to bolster its economy at home. The occupation of Manchuria in
      1931 and the creation of Manchukuo in 1932 extended Japanese influence commercially and
      politically. Socially and politically the rise of militarism and extreme nationalism were strong
      influences. Powerful military interests controlled the government and after the invasion of China in
      1937 it announced in 1938 the New Order in East Asia which was to be a mutually beneficial
      political, cultural and economic union of Japan, Manchukuo and China. The United States, opposed
      to the expansion, imposed trade embargoes in July 1940 and this intensified Japan’s need for other
      sources of raw materials. In August 1940 the government announced that the New Order had been
      replaced by the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and this endorsed Japan’s imperialist
      ambitions and expansion into Southeast Asia. Military expenditure would boost the economy and
      provide employment in industry. Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy in
      September 1940 and remained in dispute with the US over the trade boycott. Japan attacked Pearl
      Harbor in December 1941 and by May 1942 had control over the Eastern seaboard of China,
      Southeast Asia and many Pacific islands. Japan’s initial victories resulted from its well-planned
      and coordinated surprise attacks by well-trained, experienced forces upon relatively weak and
      unprepared opponents at a time when the European colonial powers were either under German
      domination or, in the case of Britain, facing the threat of invasion. A significant factor in Japan’s
      eventual failure was its inability to win the solid and active support of the colonial peoples in the
      territories it had “liberated” from the European powers. The Japanese slogan “Asia for the Asians”
      did inspire some local nationalist movements, but they viewed the notion of the Greater East Asia
      Co-Prosperity Sphere with suspicion and saw Japan as another imperialist nation. Other factors that
      contributed to Japan’s failure were: lack of resources for a long war against a rapidly rearmed
      United States and its allies; overextension of its forces over a large area against persistent local
      resistance; and the loss of its most experienced personnel in the earlier fighting. The atomic bombs
      in 1945 ended an empire which was already doomed. Candidates will need to come to a conclusion
      about the success or otherwise of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.

Developments in Australia and New Zealand, and in the Pacific Islands 1941–2000

15.   ―Australia looks to America, free from any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with
      the United Kingdom.‖ Assess the reasons for, and the consequences up to 1971 of, this
      statement made in December 1941 by Prime Minister Curtin.

      Candidates may start by identifying why Curtin made this statement in December 1941. When
      Britain entered the Second World War in September 1939, Australia’s Prime Minister Menzies
      immediately committed Australia. In 1940–1941 Australian troops were sent to Europe and the
      Middle East to support Britain. During this time the threat of Japanese expansion in the Pacific
      region grew and this led to doubts about Britain’s ability to protect Australia. When Menzies
      visited Britain early in 1941 he was concerned about the apparent British disregard for security in
      the Pacific. Menzies’ United Australia Party government collapsed and Curtin, Labor, became
      Prime Minister in October 1941. In December Japan attacked the United States’ naval base at Pearl
      Harbor and Australia felt threatened. This prompted Curtin’s speech. Japanese expansion was
      rapid and by May 1942 Japan had much territory in the Pacific and Southeast Asia and the north of
      Australia had been bombed. Curtin recalled Australian troops and refused to comply with British
      military requests. He forged an alliance with the US and allowed Australian troops to be put under
      US command. The Pacific War caused Australia to realize that it could not depend on Britain and
      therefore Australia and New Zealand entered the ANZUS pact with the United States in 1951
      providing for mutual defence. The rise of communism in Asia presented another perceived threat
      and again Australia allied with the US and others in order to meet it and formed the South East Asia
      Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in 1954. These agreements assumed a policy of forward defence so
      that Australia joined with the US to resist the invasion of South Korea by communist North Korea
      and the communist insurgency in Vietnam. Yet, Australia also supported Britain in Malaya and
      Borneo and remained a member of the British Commonwealth. Candidates may also note that
      independence from Britain was granted, in the period from 1947 to 1971, to many countries in the
      Indian sub-continent, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Therefore, Britain’s withdrawal of a military
      presence from east of Suez in 1971 confirmed Australia’s trend of moving away from reliance on
      Britain for defence. Economically, Australia also developed closer links with Asia. Culturally,
      however, Australia still had close links with Britain and, despite post-war immigration from
      many European countries; the large number of British migrants initially reinforced the traditional
      kinship ties. The extent to which the defence policies reflected a change of loyalties is one which
      candidates will need to address.

      If only reasons or consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

16.   ―After the Second World War the foreign and economic policies of New Zealand altered
      considerably and became focussed on Asia and the Pacific Islands.‖ To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      Candidates may note that the Second World War caused New Zealand to realize that they could not
      depend on Britain for defence. This led to the ANZUS pact between Australia, New Zealand and
      the United States providing mutual defence. The rise of Communism in Asia presented another
      perceived threat and again New Zealand joined with others in order to meet it, this time entering the
      South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO). These agreements assumed a policy of forward
      defence so that New Zealand sent forces to resist North Korea’s invasion of South Korea and to
      fight communist insurgents in Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam. New Zealand was involved with the
      Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries (Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia,
      Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei) and the Pacific Island states to promote regional cooperation
      on security issues. Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1972 reduced
      the access of former British colonies and dominions in the region to British trade and markets. This
      caused New Zealand to turn to East and South East Asia as economic partners, particularly to
      China. New Zealand formally recognized the People’s Republic of China in 1972 and this bilateral
      relationship grew to become one of New Zealand’s most important. New Zealand played a key role
      in the Colombo Plan, which provided developing nations in the region with aid and expertise.
      New Zealand was instrumental in establishing the South Pacific Forum in 1971, which in 1999
      became the Pacific Island Forum. This group met annually to discuss issues of mutual concern to
      the region such as economic development, tourism, trade, security and education. New Zealand’s
      foreign policy did not vary greatly and there was a degree of consensus amongst the major political
      parties. Much of New Zealand’s foreign policy was focused on the Pacific region and economic
      assistance was given to projects in the South Pacific Island states. In the late twentieth century New
      Zealand followed an increasingly isolationist policy and a strong anti-nuclear stance opposed to
      French and US policies in the region. Despite these foreign policy and economic shifts,
      membership of the British Commonwealth still remained significant to New Zealand. Candidates
      will have to come to a conclusion about the extent to which New Zealand’s foreign and economic
      policies altered.

Developments in South and Southeast Asia from mid twentieth century to 2000

17.   Analyse the policies and achievements of either Rajiv Gandhi (1984–1991) in India or Zia
      (1977–1988) in Pakistan.

      Rajiv Gandhi
      Candidates may start by outlining his political career. This may include: the pressure place on him
      by his mother, Indira Gandhi, and the Indian National Congress Party to enter politics after the
      death of his brother, Sanjay, in 1980; his election to Parliament in 1981; being chosen by the
      Congress Party as Prime Minister after the assassination of his mother in 1984; the landslide victory
      of the elections shortly after in 1984; the Bofors corruption scandal that contributed to his defeat in
      1989; and his assassination by a Tamil supporter whist campaigning in 1991. Candidates will need
      to analyse his policies and achievements. Rajiv Gandhi moved away from the more socialist
      policies of his mother and encouraged the development of small businesses. He reduced taxes and
      import quotas on consumer goods and developed the information technology and
      telecommunications industries. Yet, during the course of his rule the value of the rupee dropped
      considerably. In education he gave support to science and technology, expanded higher education
      and established a programme to promote secondary education in rural areas. Internal security in the
      Punjab was a major issue and his government imposed martial law which was controversial. Rajiv
      Gandhi improved India’s relationship with the US, whilst still maintaining friendship with the
      USSR. The most contentious of his policies was his government’s involvement in the civil war in
      Sri Lanka. Under his mother’s government India had supported the Tamil rebels, but after the
      Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord in 1987 the support shifted to the Sri Lankan government. The Indian
      Peace Keeping Force aimed to disarm the rebels and get them to accept the Accord. This proved
      unpopular in India and contributed to Rajiv Gandhi’s defeat in 1989 and his death in 1991.

      Zia
      Candidates may start by outlining his political career. Zia was the Chief of the Army under
      Bhutto’s government. Democratic elections were held in 1977 and the Pakistan People’s Party
      won, but this was challenged by the opposition. Bhutto was accused of rigging the vote and was
      implicated in the murder of a political opponent. The military, led by General Zia, staged a coup,
      relieved Bhutto of power and had him executed for murder in 1979. Zia initially promised to hold
      new elections, but these were postponed and he maintained martial law. He became President in
      1978, consolidated his power as head of state and introduced Islamic law. From 1980 to 1985 he
      ruled with the help of an advisory body, the Shoora, made up of intellectuals, technocrats and
      economists. In 1984 he held a referendum to ensure his continuation as head of state and then
      allowed elections in 1985. The new government ended martial law, but was essentially controlled
      by Zia. In 1988 he dissolved this government and promised to hold elections within 90 days, but he
      was killed in a suspicious aeroplane crash. Candidates will need to analyse his policies and
      achievements. Zia’s government consolidated Pakistan’s nuclear programme begun under Bhutto,
      but it changed his socialist policies and successfully encouraged private enterprize and the growth
      of industry. His government developed closer relations with the US and Pakistan benefitted from
      US aid. In part this was due to Zia’s stance on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. He was
      anti-communist and supported the mujahedeen resistance. This gained the financial backing of the
      US under President Reagan. These policies are considered controversial because they encouraged
      Islamic fundamentalism and endorsed violence. This led to a more divided Pakistan and increased
      support for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in the 1990s.

18.   ―The war in Vietnam (1955–1975) was a conflict about ideology not nationalism.‖ To what
      extent do you agree with this assessment of the Vietnam War?

      Candidates may initially establish that the Vietnamese nationalist struggle began against the French
      and resulted in victory in the 1946–1954 First Indo-China War and then make comments to the
      effect that the Vietnam War (1955–1975) developed from the unsatisfactory resolution of this
      conflict at the 1954 Geneva Conference. Relevant points that may be considered include: Ho Chi
      Minh’s declaration of independence on 2 September 1945; President Truman ignored Ho’s letters
      and did not recognize the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; the 1954 Geneva Conference split
      Vietnam at the seventeenth parallel; South Vietnam was proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam
      (RVN) in 1955 under Ngo Dinh Diem and the United States began to provide military and
      economic aid; the elections promised for 1956 and the reunification of the country did not happen
      because both Diem and the US feared a communist victory. The regime in South Vietnam was
      unpopular: there was chaos and corruption; communist insurgencies were supported by North
      Vietnam and in 1960 Ho Chi Minh established the National Liberation Front (NLF) in South
      Vietnam; self-immolation protests against the Diem government by Buddhist monks; US Central
      Intelligence Agency (CIA) was implicated in the assassination of Diem in 1963. The reasons why
      the United States entered the conflict should be linked to the Cold War: the US viewed Ho Chi
      Minh as a communist threat in the light of the emerging Cold War tensions; 1947 Truman Doctrine,
      policy of containment; end of the Korean War in 1953 and the stalemate which existed there; the
      domino theory and the rollback policy of Eisenhower and Dulles; Kennedy’s commitment to
      liberty; the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution legitimized the introduction of US troops. In 1965 US
      forces and their allies arrived in South Vietnam. The USSR and China provided aid to North
      Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Ho Chi Minh was a charismatic nationalist leader. The widespread
      use of propaganda in North Vietnam depicted the war as both a nationalist and an ideological
      struggle. President Nixon’s Vietnamisation policy in 1969 initiated the beginning of the US
      withdrawal. The war ended with the defeat of South Vietnamese forces and the fall of Saigon to the
      communists in 1975. There is wide scope for candidates to discuss the ideological and nationalist
      aspects of the war and both should be addressed. Many students may challenge the assumption
      inherent in the question. Expect a variety of material and reward all relevant comment.

China: the regional superpower from mid twentieth century to 2000

19.   ―Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) was disappointingly inconsistent as a nation builder.‖ Is this a
      fair appraisal of Mao’s leadership between 1949 and 1976?

      This is a broad question and candidates may cover a lot of material in their responses. Candidates
      may make a distinction between Mao, the popular revolutionary leader who gains power in 1949
      and Mao, the nation builder who makes mistakes. Some candidates may initially discuss Maoism:
      concepts of land redistribution, peasant socialism, working alongside the peasants, class struggle,
      gender equality, right thinking, rectification, continuous revolution, the mass line, the Yanan
      (Yenan) Spirit and Chinese nationalism; and assess the extent to which Mao disappointed in the
      application and achievement of these as a nation builder. Candidates’ responses will need to
      address both the positive and the negative aspects of Mao Zedong’s (Mao Tse-tung’s) rule in
      the People’s Republic of China 1949–1946. Expect candidates to discuss Mao’s policies and
      campaigns throughout the 27 year period: the New China reconstruction period 1949–1952;
      the First Five Year Plan 1952–1957; the 100 Flowers and Anti-Rightist Campaigns 1956–1957;
      the Great Leap Forward 1958–1961; the moderate period 1961–1965; the Socialist Education
      Movement 1962; and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution 1966–1976. Candidates may also
      discuss Mao’s leadership in relation to the roles of other leaders such as Lin Biao (Lin Piao),
      Liu Shaoqi (Liu Shao-ch’i), Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing), Zhou Enlai (Chou En-lai),
      Peng Dehuai (P’eng Te-huai) and Jiang Qing (Chiang Ch’ing). Foreign policy may also be
      discussed, including Mao’s rapprochement with the United States in 1972. Candidates may
      recognize that Mao continued to assert an influence after his death in that his legacy and the cult
      that had surrounded him could not immediately be ignored. Some may mention the CCP
      reassessment of Mao in July 1981 and that the split of 70 % good and 30 % bad has become the
      accepted Chinese official assessment of Mao. Expect reasoned and balanced discussion based on
      evidence and knowledge and reward originality. Candidates should provide an assessment of
      Mao’s leadership and will need to come to a conclusion about the extent to which they agree with
      the assertion in the question.
                                                 – 23 –             M12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M


20.   Assess the political developments in China under Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing)
      (1976–1997).

      This is a question about the political developments under Deng’s leadership so extensive discussion
      about economic issues should not be the main focus of the answer. Candidates may initially discuss
      Deng’s (Teng’s) return to political affairs after the Cultural Revolution (1966–1969) and identify
      this as the beginning of Deng’s political power. Zhou Enlai (Chou En-lai), China’s Foreign
      Minister and Premier used his influence with Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) to have Deng re-instated
      as Vice-Premier in 1974. In 1975 Deng (Teng) worked with Zhou (Chou) drafting the Four
      Modernizations, a new economic reform programme. Mao distrusted Deng’s (Teng’s) confidence
      and felt he was reversing the Cultural Revolution. In January 1976 Zhou Enlai (Chou En-lai) died
      and in April, 1976 thousands rallied in Tiananmen Square in memory of him. The Gang of Four
      blamed Deng (Teng) and he was dismissed from all his posts whilst Hua Guofeng (Hua Kuo-feng)
      was promoted to Premier. Mao died in September 1976 and Hua arrested the Gang of Four in
      October. After this, calls to reinstate Deng were made by the people and from inside the
      Party. One year after Zhou’s death, Tiananmen Square again filled with pro-Deng (Teng) rallies.
      In July 1977, Deng (Teng) returned to all his former posts and he proceeded to undermine Hua’s
      authority. In preparation for the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Party National People’s Congress in
      1978 Deng (Teng) criticized Hua’s adherence to Mao’s ideology and advocated new directions.
      The Four Modernizations were accepted at this meeting as the basis for future economic
      development. Hua was removed from office by 1982. Hu Yaobang (Hu Yao-pang) and Zhao
      Ziyang (Chao Tzu-yang), supporters of Deng (Teng), were appointed to senior leadership positions.
      The Gang of Four were tried and sentenced in 1980–1981. Initially, Deng (Teng) tolerated the
      existence of the Democracy Wall where criticisms of the Left and demands for reform within the
      Party were posted. However, once the political reformers demanded a “Fifth Modernization”,
      political democracy, Deng (Teng) closed the Democracy Wall and the main dissident Wei
      Jingsheng (Wei Ching-sheng) was jailed for 15 years. Deng (Teng) advocated “people’s
      democracy”, but he did not support the idea of a Western liberal multi-party democracy. He
      adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles that he restated in 1979: “keeping to the socialist road”;
      “upholding the people’s democratic dictatorship”; upholding leadership by the Communist Party’;
      and “upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought”. Nevertheless, a fledgling
      pro-democracy movement developed and in 1986 there were student protests. Hu Yaobang
      (Hu Yao-pang) supported the protesters, but was subsequently removed from office. His death in
      April 1989 sparked student unrest in Tiananmen Square. There were a number of factors that
      eventually led to the massacre in June: the visit of Gorbachev; the humiliation felt by Deng (Teng);
      the rift between the more liberal General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang (Chao Tzu-yang) and the
      conservative Premier, Li Peng; Zhao’s (Chao’s) dismissal; the imposition of martial law; and the
      students’ refusal to disperse. In the aftermath Deng’s (Teng’s) government treated dissidents
      harshly. Deng (Teng) may have introduced economic reforms which transformed the lives of many
      Chinese, but he believed in the authority of the Chinese Communist Party as the only legitimate
      power. He wanted internal stability after the upheavals of the Mao years.

Global impact of the region in the second half of the twentieth century
21.   Compare and contrast the economic development between 1945 and 2000 in two of the following
      countries: Japan; Taiwan; Hong Kong; South Korea; Singapore; Malaysia; Thailand.
      Candidates may choose any two of the countries listed in the question and their responses should
      compare and contrast the economic development in both. There should be some attempt to define
      what is meant by the term “economic development” and candidates should identify the factors that
      contributed to this in the chosen countries. Popular choices will probably be Japan, Taiwan, Hong
      Kong, South Korea and Singapore. Many countries have adopted capitalist systems which generally
      share the characteristics of private ownership of property and the means of production and the
      encouragement of private enterprize to respond to market forces, but there is variation amongst these
      countries over the nature and degree of state control and intervention in economic planning and
      development. Other factors apart from the state should be indicated: outside forces such as a steady
      expansion of world trade; globalization and the tendency for large multinational companies to grow to
      service global markets; the ease of access to foreign markets; and the role and influence of the
      American market. Cultural traditions may also have contributed significantly to promoting economic
      development: Confucian values may have favoured labour discipline; the postponement of personal
      gratification for the national good; the reliance upon family, clan and community support systems.
      Japan
      Will be a popular choice as it has dominated the Pacific Asian economy and the role of the state has
      been significant in determining the success of economic development. After the Second World War
      Japan’s major trading partner was the US. To maintain their price advantage with the West, Japan
      moved production facilities to other Asian countries as costs rose domestically in the latter part of
      the twentieth century. Japan effectively expanded its available labour force to include those of
      other Asian countries as well. Japan has diversified economic production to sell Japanese products
      for foreign markets, ranging from children’s toys to electronics and automobiles. Globalisation has
      played a key role in the economic development of Japan.
      South Korea
      Initially exercised heavy state control of its economy, but by the end of the twentieth century this
      had lessened. There was rapid industrialisation based on foreign investment. Ship building,
      automobiles, construction, armaments and advanced technology all developed in response to global
      markets and also increased the growth in the economy and the standard of living in South Korea.
      Taiwan
      Benefited from economic and military aid from the United States and from investment from Chinese
      people living overseas. Taiwan also had access to highly trained management and business personnel
      from overseas. By 1968 some 90 % of farming land was owned by those who worked it. Four Year
      Plans for industry produced an annual growth rate of 9.7 % in the ten year period after 1963. Changes
      in mainland China’s economy since the 1980s have provided investment opportunities there for the
      Taiwanese. Taiwan became highly industrialized and specialized in information technology.
      Singapore and Hong Kong
      Were initially British colonies. Singapore became independent in 1965 and Britain handed over
      Hong Kong to China in 1997. Both had large Chinese populations who dominated the commercial
      sector. Each developed as a major port for its region and as a centre of commerce, trade and
      banking and both encouraged industry, communications and their national infrastructure.
      Award credit for reasoned discussion based upon historical evidence. Many answers will focus on
      comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified.
      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

22.   To what extent did religion influence relations between countries of the region during the
      second half of the twentieth century?

      Candidates may consider the influence of religion along with other aspects of the relations between
      countries in the region. Do not expect candidates to discuss all the countries in the region, they may
      use various case studies, but they should discuss more than one country. Popular choices may be
      India and Pakistan; Indonesia and Australia; Burma and Thailand, but reward any appropriate
      choice of countries.

      India and Pakistan both gained independence after the British partition of India in 1947. Pakistan
      became a Muslim state, which eventually had authoritarian governments, whilst India became a
      secular democracy with a Hindu majority. Partition caused millions of people to be displaced. This
      whole process led to many violent clashes and massacres. Since 1947 relations between India and
      Pakistan have remained tense. The control of the different Muslim and Hindu regions of Kashmir
      was the focal point of much conflict leading to wars in 1947, 1965 and 1999. In the 1971
      Indo-Pakistan War, India supported the liberation of Bangladesh. India recognized the Soviet
      backed government of Afghanistan whilst Pakistan supported the resistance to the Soviet invasion
      of Afghanistan in 1979. In the late twentieth century the rise of Islamic fundamentalism with links
      to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda flourished in Pakistan with India being opposed to the Taliban in
      Afghanistan. Pakistan was blamed for several acts of terrorism in India in the 1990s.

      Indonesia declared independence in August 1945 under President Sukarno, but only in 1949 was
      war with the Dutch ended and independence officially recognized. The new state was a federation
      of the separate islands and provinces but became a unitary state in 1950. Islam had played an
      important part in the drive for independence and Sukarno provided charismatic leadership, the
      symbols of nationalism and the national language (Malay) were taught and opposition in the outer
      islands brought under control. As president, he embodied the state and attempted to balance the
      army, the Muslims and communist threats. In 1962, Indonesia acquired Irian Jaya (West New
      Guinea) from the Dutch and in 1963 confronted Malaysia. The Indonesian constitution guarantees
      freedom of religion, but only six major religious groups are recognized, Islam, Protestant
      Christianity, Roman Catholicism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Confucianism. The tensions between
      the Islamic majority, which is nearly 90 % and minority religious groups often occurred. During
      the 1960s, Suharto tried to create a more secular state and include members of other religious
      groups in his government. In the late twentieth century the treatment of Christians in Aceh; the
      issue of the independence of the largely Roman Catholic East Timor; and the rise of Islamic
      fundamentalism and terrorism affected Indonesia’s relations with other countries in the region,
      including Australia.

      Burma achieved independence in 1948 and factional rivalry leading to violence was prevalent in
      Burmese politics causing Ne Win to seize power in 1962 and set up a Revolutionary Council to
      govern the country. Burma became a single-party state under the Burma Socialist Programme
      Party, which created an ideology based on a mixture of Marxist and Buddhist principles. This led
      to economic decline, isolation and repression, particularly of Christian minority groups who were
      deemed to symbolize Western imperialism. Also targeted have been the ethnic Karen people, of
      whom 40 % are Christian. The Karen refugees have fled to Thailand and this has led to tensions
      between the two countries.

      If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

Social and economic developments 1945–2000

23.   Discuss the extent to which the traditional arts and culture of one country of the region were
      affected by outside influences between 1945 and 2000.

      Candidates may choose any country from the region. They will need to define what they consider
      to be “outside influences”. Possible choices may include: the globalisation of the economy; the use
      of English as an international language; the globalisation of popular culture through television, film
      and music; international sport; tourism; and immigration. Globalisation of the economy may have
      impacted on the traditional arts and culture in a number of ways: a uniformity of products available;
      the creation of consumer markets; changes in customs and the institution of the family; changing
      levels of education; the impact on sport and leisure pursuits; the impact on religious observance and
      values. The widespread use of English means that since 1945 popular Western culture, particularly
      American, has penetrated many countries through television, film, popular music and more recently
      the internet. Many candidates may argue that this has had a negative impact on the traditional arts
      and crafts, music, drama, beliefs and practices so that these have become largely part of the tourist
      industry rather than everyday life. Better candidates may realize that the global culture has been
      only accessible to certain segments of the population and that the poor may have remained fairly
      traditional. International sport has become an important focus in the region since 1945 and sporting
      events are often occasions where aspects of national culture are highlighted. Examples of this are:
      the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games and the Commonwealth Games; the New Zealand
      All Blacks rugby team. With newly independent nations, traditional songs, dances and art forms
      may be taken from their localized settings and incorporated into ceremonies linked to sporting
      events to produce a sense of national identity and recognition internationally. In Australia, the
      1972–1975 Whitlam Government adopted the policy of multiculturalism. European and Asian
      immigration contributed cultural change in Australian society which was apparent by the 1980s and
      1990s: in food and in eating out in cafes and restaurants; in liquor licensing laws; in the diversity of
      sports played; in the variety and the appreciation of all forms of the arts; in religious composition.
      Yet the basic British heritage of institutions such as the legal system; education; and government
      administration still remain. Indigenous arts and crafts are part of the tourism industry but beyond
      that a vibrant indigenous artistic culture has been revived. In New Zealand a similar pattern
      occurred, though the New Zealand culture was also shaped by the immigration of Pacific Islanders
      by the end of the twentieth century.

      Award reasoned and balanced argument based on evidence and a historical perspective relating to
      the country chosen.

24.   In what ways, and with what consequences, did technology change the social structures and
      the economy of one country of the region in the second half of the twentieth century?

      Candidates may choose any country from the region. Responses need to show a clear
      understanding of what is meant by the term “technology”. This may include computer technology
      and the internet, television and films; mobile telephones, automation in industry; satellite
      communications; transport; farm machinery; and medical equipment. Candidates need to
      demonstrate the links between technological change and the social and economic changes that have
      taken place in the chosen country since the Second World War. Technological change often means
      that there is considerable upheaval and change in a society. This may be both positive and negative.
      Social structures refer to the distinctive, stable arrangement of institutions whereby human beings in
      a society interact and live together. Candidates may refer to a range of changes in the social
      structure that have come about as a result of technological change: the position of women; social
      mobility; population growth and distribution; migration from the countryside to cities; accessibility
      to education; accessibility to better health care; effects upon rural and regional areas; community
      and political organizations; crime rates; rise of a new middle class; the traditional culture and
      lifestyle may have been undermined; greater exposure to a global culture; the development of a
      youth culture; the state may have more control over people’s lives; a stronger sense of national
      identity and greater national cohesion may emerge. Changes to the economy may vary: poverty and
      wealth will both have developed; new jobs may have been created; more efficient systems may
      have developed in business, agriculture, fishing and mining that stimulate the economy; rural areas
      may have thrived or become depressed; redundancies and unemployment may have occurred;
      globalisation of the country’s economy; the entertainment industry may have flourished; tourism
      and leisure activities may or may not have benefitted.

      Look for clarity of thought, the statement of opinion based upon factual knowledge and specific
      reference. Weaker candidates will make sweeping generalisations with little factual reference.
      Better candidates should reveal knowledge, backed with evidence, of what technological change
      entails and its impact for good or bad upon the people of the country chosen. They should be able
      to identify and discuss the consequences on both the social structures and the economy

      If only ways or consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
