          a definition of devaluation

          an explanation of devaluation
          an explanation that as depreciation/devaluation occurs import prices will rise and less imports
            will be purchased while more exports will be sold due to decreased prices. An improvement of
            the current account will result
          an explanation of the importance of elasticities and that if exports and imports are price inelastic
            and the sum of price elasticity of exports and imports (in absolute value) is greater than 1 then an
            improvement in the current account is possible.

         A full explanation of the Marshall-Lerner condition or of the J-curve is not required but it should be
         taken into consideration when included. Based on the quality of the response, it is possible to
         award full marks even if the Marshall-Lerner condition is not mentioned.
