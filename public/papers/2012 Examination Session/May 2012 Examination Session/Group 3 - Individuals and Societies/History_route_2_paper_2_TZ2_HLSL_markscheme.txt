uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present, as will understanding of historical
        processes, but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations but they are
        not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied as
        evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented.
 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and, if appropriate, may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
        evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and
        contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1       Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   “The success of guerrilla movements depends on the leader’s ability to maintain discipline
     and the support of their followers.” With reference to two guerrilla wars, assess the validity of
     this statement.

     Popular choices will be: Vietnam, China, Cuba, Afghanistan (1979–1989), Algeria, Nicaragua but
     any valid examples may be used.

     The role of the leader should be addressed, even if only to show that it is less crucial than other
     factors.

     The leader’s role, apart from developing the aims and policies of the movement and recruiting key
     supporters, is to maintain the morale, dedication and focus of the members of the movement.
     The length of the struggle and the military power of the enemy may prove demoralizing to some
     and so the leader must work to maintain the morale of his followers and their dedication to, and
     understanding of, the political, economic and social goals of the movement. Guerrilla movements
     depend on popular support and the leader must make sure that his followers gain and retain popular
     support or the populace will not see the guerrillas as offering anything better and may not support
     them. Examples of methods used to maintain discipline may include: summary execution of
     disloyal followers; political re-education; punishment for failure to adhere to the goals and
     principles of the movement.

     The other factors that may play a role in the success of a guerrilla movement may include: strength
     or weakness of the opposing regime; foreign intervention or assistance; the program offered by the
     guerrillas and its appeal to the populace; the geography and terrain of the country; the social
     structure of the population; the ideology of the guerrillas; the mistakes or errors of the opposition in
     the course of the war.

     N.B. In the case of Vietnam and China, for example, the guerrilla wars were composed of two
     separate parts. Candidates may not choose two parts of the war in the same country to satisfy the
     two war requirement.

     If only one war is selected, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                  –5–               M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


2.   Analyse the social and economic effects of one war that occurred in the first half of the
     twentieth century.

     If the war chosen is from the second half of the twentieth century, the response should receive no
     credit.

     Candidates must limit their responses to social and economic effects. Unless explicitly linked to the
     question, discussions of political or constitutional changes or of military outcomes will probably not
     be relevant.

     Social effects may include: the impact of the war upon the following: gender issues; human rights;
     religious practice;, the interruption of education;, family or class structure;, demographic changes;,
     racial or ethnic issues.

     Economic effects may include: recession, inflation, trade issues, government involvement in the
     economy, taxation, standard of living, employment rise or decline of industry and agriculture.

     Students may choose to discuss the effects on one specific country or on several countries. Either
     approach is acceptable. It is also acceptable for students to discuss effects that continue beyond
     1950.

     N.B. Candidates may select a war that began between 1900 and 1950 but which did not conclude
     until after 1950. Examples would be the Korean War (1950–1953) or the first Vietnam war
     (1945–1954). As always the Cold War is not a war for the purposes of questions in this topic area.

     If only economic or social effects are addressed, mark out of [12 marks].


3.   Assess the reasons for either the Indo-Pakistan War (1947–1949) or the Gulf War (1991).

     Candidates must present a well-structured and supported analytical essay to explain the reasons
     for one of the wars. Simple narratives or descriptions of events leading up to the wars will not
     score well.

     The reasons for the Indo-Pakistan War may include: territorial disputes e.g. Kashmir; historical
     antipathy between Muslims and Hindus; a continuation of the communal violence which broke out
     when India and Pakistan gained independence, exacerbated by population migration; the failure of
     Britain to provide a peaceful transformation into two states. It may also be noted that radical
     religious groups, on both sides, served to inflame emotions and support violence.

     Reasons for the Gulf War may include: the consequences of the Iran-Iraq War that prompted the
     Iraqi invasion of Kuwait; threats to the Western oil supply; fear of Iraqi power and perceived threats
     to other states in the region by Iraq; a desire to restore a balance of power in the region after the
     Iran-Iraq war; the American decision to oppose Iraq and the formation of a broad coalition to do so;
     the end of the Cold War also meant that the US could act without fear of Soviet opposition.
                                                 –6–              M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


4.   For what reasons, and with what results, did foreign intervention occur in either the Spanish
     Civil War (1936–1939) or the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970)?

     Spain
     Reasons for foreign intervention in Spain could include: requests for aid from the opposing sides;
     the desire of foreign powers to expand their military, diplomatic and economic influence in Spain;
     support given for ideological reasons, as in the case of Germany, Italy and Portugal. Foreign
     intervention was possible because of the weakness of the League’s Non-Intervention Pact that was
     signed but ignored by Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union. British and French policy was to abide
     by the pact but in such a way that a “blind eye” was turned towards trangressors. The Soviet Union
     used Comintern to organize the International Brigades and also sold equipment to the Republican
     government. Candidates may point out that Soviet intervention was largely to ensure that the
     “right” kind of Communists were given aid and never enough to change the course of the war. The
     members of the International Brigades went to Spain for idealistic reasons and these ranged from
     the promotion of communism to a desire to protect democracy from fascism. Other reasons were
     Spain’s strategic importance and valuable resources, for example, Germany received imports of
     copper and iron ore in exchange for its support for the Nationalists. Also, some candidates may
     refer to the American Neutrality Acts that allowed US companies to trade with the Nationalists.

     Results: Franco’s victory was partially a consequence of military aid. Foreign intervention
     prolonged the war as aid was never enough to ensure a rapid victory – this increased the number of
     casualties and the damage to Spain’s infrastructure and economy. The economy was also damaged
     by the transfer, by the Republican government of Spain’s gold reserves to the Soviet Union.

     Franco’s victory also meant that Spain was relatively supportive of the Axis powers in the Second
     World War. The Non-Intervention Pact could also be said to have been an indication of the
     appeasement policies of France and Britain, with far-reaching consequences.

     Nigeria
     The intervention in the Nigerian Civil War was not as overt as that in Spain and many nations
     officially refused to become involved. Some nations supported both sides, often in a covert manner,
     until the likely outcome was clear or to exploit the situation for economic gain. Other states
     allowed their citizens to organize and dispatch aid in various forms to Biafra or to participate as
     mercenaries. This was true in a number of democratic states where the Biafran cause gained
     support on humanitarian grounds.

     The reasons for foreign intervention in the Nigerian Civil War may include: a desire to weaken a
     regional rival by certain West African states; a desire by some states to gain access to the oil
     reserves in Eastern Nigeria by supporting Biafra;, economic gain from selling armaments to either
     side. No foreign armies were dispatched to Nigeria but a number of volunteers and mercenaries
     fought for both sides, especially Biafra. Some of these mercenaries were supported by countries
     anxious to keep the war going for economic reasons or to support their belief in the legitimate
     aspirations of the Ibo people for independence. Many independent agencies and ad hoc relief
     groups intervened by flying in aid to Biafra, both military and humanitarian. These agencies had
     the covert support of governments in Europe and Africa.
                                                  –7–               M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


     The results of foreign intervention were to prolong the war. This extension of the war added a vast
     number of deaths through starvation, disease and combat. Foreign intervention probably did not
     change the outcome of the war. The government of Nigeria was accused of genocide as a result of
     its actions during the war.

     The question has two parts and candidates must address both of them.            If only one part is
     addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


5.   “Technology is a key factor in winning wars.” With reference to two wars that took place in
     the second half of the twentieth century, explain to what extent you agree with this statement.

     If the wars chosen are from the first half of the twentieth century, , the response should receive no
     credit.

     Wars that began before 1950 but continued past that year are eligible for consideration.

     Responses must be analytical, well-structured and supported by relevant detail. As this is a
     “to what extent” question, candidates must develop a clear thesis with respect to the statement.
     Candidates may choose to show that factors other than technology are more crucial to success in
     warfare. These might include: military leadership and strategy; morale; training of troops; civilian
     support for or opposition to either side; foreign assistance;, local knowledge and use of topography;
     economic wealth; access to armaments. No matter what view is taken,the candidate would need to
     address the issue of technology in their response.

     Examples of wars which may be appropriate choices include: Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Gulf
     War, Falklands/Malvinas.

     Vietnam and Afghanistan may be popular choices for those who wish to show that technology will
     not guarantee success. In each of these cases, the losing side had extensive modern technology but
     was not able to prevail through poor strategy, lack of popular support, topography, high morale
     of the opponents and resentment at foreign intervention. The Gulf War, Korea and the
     Falklands/Malvinas may offer better arguments that technology was the deciding factor, although
     candidates may point out that success was the result of other factors, in addition to technology.

     In any event, candidates should produce a well-reasoned and supported defence of the position that
     they have taken. They may show that the statement was valid with respect to one war and not
     another and demonstrate why.

     N.B. Candidates may select wars that began before 1950 as long as they continued into the second
     half of the twentieth century, for example, the first Vietnam War (1945–54);

     If only one eligible war is chosen, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                 –8–               M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


6.   Assess the importance of each of the following as causes of either the First World War or the
     Second World War: treaties; economic factors; ideology.

     Candidates must produce a response which deals with the categories stated in the question. There is
     no requirement to introduce other causes. Candidates who have pre-planned an essay on the causes
     of these wars may ignore the requirements of the question and simply produce a pre-learned
     response. This will not produce a good result as it will not address the demands of the question.

     Candidates should demonstrate an understanding of the terms mentioned in the question, in order to
     comment on their importance as causes of either war. These may be considered both as long-term
     and short-term causes.

     Treaties may be explained and used in a number of ways – these may include: alliances amongst
     nations; defensive agreements such as the 1839 treaty with Belgium that was the official reason for
     British entry into the First World War; treaties which created resentment and hostility such as the
     Paris peace treaties of 1919–20; the Nazi–Soviet pact. In relation to the Second World War,
     candidates may also consider the Munich agreement as a “treaty” and this would be acceptable.

     Economic factors may include a desire for resources, colonies or increased trade. It may also
     include war as a solution to economic problems such as weak economies, over-population,
     unemployment or, in the case of Germany, an overheated economy.

     Ideology may include: aggressive nationalist ideas; desire to destroy rival ideological systems such
     as Communism; desire to defend territory against the encroachment of new ideologies; theories of
     racial superiority/inferiority.

     Candidates may choose to focus on one part of their chosen war as providing the best examples of a
     particular factor. The Asia/Pacific theatre or Operation Barbarossa in the Second World War may,
     for example, be used as examples of war motivated by economic and ideological causes .

     If only one factor is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]. If only two are addressed,
     mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 2    Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   With reference to one democratic state (excluding Weimar Germany), analyse (a) the
     challenges they faced and (b) how successfully these challenges were overcome.

     Candidates will have a wide range of choices for this response. “Challenges” will probably be
     linked to: the economy; war; domestic insurrection and attempted overthrow of the democratic
     government; divisions caused by ethnic or religious strife; new ideologies that challenge democracy
     or promote violent conflict; the breakup of the state into several smaller parts; challenges to the
     existing status quo based on gender issues or demands for better social conditions.

     Popular choices will be countries impacted by the Great Depression, such as the US and the UK.
     Other possibilities include the separatist movements in Canada and the UK. Protest and extremist
     movements have threatened a number of countries at various times and these would provide
     material for responses.

     In all cases, candidates should focus on more than one type of challenge in the country that they
     have chosen.

     If only one part of the question is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


8.   “Full democracy undermined the state.” To what extent do you agree with this statement
     with reference to Germany (1919–1933)?

     This will be a popular question as many candidates will have studied this topic in relation to the rise
     of Hitler. This should not be seen as a question on the rise of Hitler but on the problems of the
     Weimar Republic. As this is a “ to what extent” question, candidates may introduce other factors to
     explain the collapse of the Weimar Republic, such as the effects of the Great Depression.
     Responses must be well-focused and analytical. A simple list of problems or a narrative on the rise
     of Hitler will not score well. Candidates could begin by explaining what they understand by the
     term, “full democracy”.

     The areas to consider may include: universal suffrage; proportional representation which enabled a
     wider representation of political ideas but often required the formation of coalitions to govern.
     Coalitions could, however, prevent decisive actions in times of crisis as seen in 1930. The free and
     open society alienated many traditionalists who were offended by the liberal nature of the new
     constitution. The plethora of political ideas that flourished could be seen as positive but also as a
     negative when different factions resorted to violence to pursue their ends.

     Candidates may also suggest that, because of Article 48, Weimar was not a “full democracy”.

     The question asks “to what extent” and so other areas to consider could include the following:
     the enduring unpopularity of the Versailles settlement; economic problems caused by the war;
     the severe economic dislocation of the 1923 inflation; the death of Stresemann in 1929, as he had
     been an important coalescing influence on Weimar politics; the effects of the Great Depression
     that contributed to the increased popularity of extremist attitudes on the Right and the Left; the
     anti-democratic values and poor judgment of certain individuals such as Von Papen, Von Schlei
     cher; the waning powers of President Hindenburg. In addition the continued existence of many
     anti-democratic elements within the army, the police, the bureaucracy and the legal profession
     undermined the support for the regime, particularly in times of crisis.
                                                  – 10 –             M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


9.   Analyse to what extent pressure (lobby/interest) groups may both strengthen and weaken a
     democratic state.

     This is a broad question which requires that students understand the nature and purpose
     of lobby/interest groups in a democratic state and perhaps the nature of democracy itself.
     Students may choose any state or states on which to base their response. They must deal with both
     parts of the question.

     The ways in which lobby/interest groups may strengthen a democratic state may include: the
     creation of opportunities for individual citizens to join with others of similar view to bring specific
     concerns to the attention of elected officials allowing individuals to have their voice heard by
     government; opportunities for the less powerful to gain the attention of and receive action by the
     government; the raising of awareness about a variety of issues that may have been overlooked, but
     which are important to society; the opportunity for groups, which have been overlooked to have a
     chance to be heard and have concerns addressed. Lobby groups may be able to mobilize the media
     to focus attention on the concerns of citizens and promote greater equality and fair treatment for all.
     All of these are ways to improve the quality of the democracy in a particular country.

     The ways in which lobby/pressure groups weaken a democratic state include: wealthy and powerful
     groups may use their economic power to influence the agenda of government in favour of a very
     narrow group; specific groups, whose interests may not be in the general interest, may corrupt the
     democratic process by bribing or otherwise influencing officials. Lobby groups may use money
     and power to control the government, rather than have it respond to the interests of the electorate.
     Lobby/interest groups may also contribute to an atmosphere of secrecy and hidden decision making
     that may undermine faith in the democratic process.

     In all cases, candidates should present a well-structured and supported response.

     If only one part of the question is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                 – 11 –             M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


10.   Assess how effectively the governments of either Canada (1968–1984) or Argentina
      (1983–1995) dealt with political and economic challenges.

      Candidates must confine their responses to the periods given in the question. There are two parts to
      the question; the first is to identify political and economic issues that posed a challenge to the
      society and then to assess how effectively the governments in power dealt with them.

      Canada
      Some of the political and economic issues may include the secession crisis in Quebec in the 1970s
      that led to violence and the election of a secessionist party in Quebec. This was followed by a
      referendum to determine whether Quebec would secede from Canada, posing a serious challenge to
      the unity of the country and provoking fierce debate. Economic challenges that may be mentioned
      include the energy crisis and stagflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. Disputes over the control of
      national resources, especially oil, also posed significant economic and political problems. The
      methods used to deal with these problems included the use of martial law to address the October
      Crisis and strong federal opposition to defeat the independence referendum in 1980. Economic
      crises were dealt with by wage and price control legislation to control inflation and increased
      government spending used to attack unemployment. A new national energy program was designed
      to deal with the energy crisis, although this proved unpopular in some areas and led to further
      political division. Canada acquired a new constitution in 1981, although Quebec refused to sign the
      document.

      Argentina
      The major political challenges to the Alfonsin government included: the decision to try military
      officers accused of human rights abuses during the previous regime; the need to put democracy on a
      firmer footing; the need to control serious inflation in the Argentinean economy. Essentially,
      Alfonsin was relatively unsuccessful as the military revolted against his plan to try a large number
      of officers and his economic plans had limited impact. He was replaced by Carlos Menem in 1989,
      although Menem faced the same problems. He was more successful, however, in maintaining
      democracy as he gained the support of the military by releasing convicted generals from prison.
      Menem also improved the Argentine economy by cutting government expenditure and removing
      government regulation. His policies proved popular and he was re-elected in 1995.

      If only political or economic challenges are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

11.   With reference to two democratic states, analyse the causes of political extremism and how
      successful the states were in dealing with it.

      Candidates may choose from any two democratic states. Popular choices might include the Weimar
      Republic, pre-fascist Italy, Canada in the FLQ period, Western European states in the 1960s,
      although any democratic state may be considered.

      The causes of political extremism may include: economic crises; military defeats; ethnic or
      religious divisions; demands for changes in public policy; nationalism; demands for independence
      by groups within the society; the introduction of new, populist ideologies; events in other countries
      which provide an inspiration to extremists; the emergence of individuals with extremist views,
      effects of modern communication on spreading new ideas.

      To assess the extent to which they were successful, candidates will need to consider whether or not
      extremism was successful in its goals, what methods or policies were introduced in response to the
      extremist challenges and how successful these were in defeating, defusing or modifying the
      challenge to democracy.

      If only one state is addressed or if only one part of the question is addressed, mark out of a
      maximum of [12 marks].

12.   Analyse how democracy was established in either South Africa after 1991 or Japan after 1945.

      Candidates must select one of the above and provide a well-structured and well-supported response.

      Japan
      Ways in which democracy was established may include: defeat in the war, which eliminated the
      military dictatorship; the American occupation and direction of the Japanese government after the
      Second World War, including the supervision of the establishment of a new government and
      constitution; the loss of power and status of the Emperor who became a constitutional monarch after
      the war; the revival of Japanese democracy that had been overthrown in the 1930s. The economic
      prosperity of the 1950s also encouraged support for the new democratic government as did fear of
      Communism and the continued American presence.

      South Africa
      The end of apartheid allowed all citizens to participate in the political process. The reasons for the
      establishment of democracy may include: the decision by the South African government to reach an
      agreement with the African majority to end apartheid and establish a new form of government;
      President de Klerk’s decision to free Mandela from prison and to enter into negotiations with him.
      The majority of white South Africans wanted to negotiate a new form of government and this was
      crucial to the success of a new democratic government. An interim constitution, as result of
      multiparty negotiations, was agreed upon in 1993. The white population approved the new
      constitution which made for a peaceful transition to democracy. Elections under universal suffrage
      were held in April 1994, but extremist parties did poorly and this further aided the establishment of
      democracy. Mandela had a key role throughout the process of establishing democracy. He insisted
      on reconciliation between the races and led a government of national unity to include all parties and
      to prevent factionalism and violence, which would threaten democracy. His personal status and
      influence was also a key factor in the constitutional negotiations and the implementation of a
      democratic system.

Topic 3        Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   With reference to the leaders of two single-party states, each chosen from a different region,
      analyse to what extent internal conflict and weak governments contributed to their rise to
      power.

      Candidates will need to choose two leaders , each from a different region, and present a
      well-structured analytical essay, supported by relevant content. The responses need to address the
      importance of the two causes mentioned in the question, even though other reasons may also be
      introduced. Narratives or simple descriptions of the rise to power of leaders in a particular state
      would be unlikely to score well. Popular choices may include Nazi Germany, Italy, Russia, Cuba,
      Argentina, Spain and China.

      Internal conflict may include: civil war; attempted or successful uprisings; demonstrations or coups
      d’état; military–civilian conflicts; class, religion or ethnic based conflict; ideological divisions; lack
      of cooperation among political parties.

      Ineffective government may include: poor economic decision-making; the inability to develop
      popular support; the absence of strong or experienced leaders; the failure to recognize and deal with
      economic or social problems; an unwillingness to respond to popular demands; the failure to act
      decisively to suppress dissent or opposition; the failure to introduce policies which would attract
      support. Candidates may also refer to foreign policy, but this is not required.

      N.B. This question refers to the rise to power of leaders and not their rule and therefore responses
      should credit only relevant material.

      If only one leader is chosen or if two states from the same region are chosen, mark out of a
      maximum of [12 marks].
                                                   – 15 –             M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


14.   Analyse the ways in which either Stalin or Nasser came to power.

      This question requires a well-structure analytical response. Simple descriptions of events leading to
      their rise to power will not score well.

      Stalin
      “Ways” may include: Stalin’s role as General Secretary, which allowed him to place his supporters
      in key positions and steadily increase their numbers; his skill at making alliances to eliminate his
      rivals one by one; his use of party rules, such as the ban on factionalism, that allowed him to isolate
      and eliminate his opponents; his focus on gaining political power rather than debating ideological
      questions also gave him an advantage. The mistakes of his opponents in not recognizing Stalin’s
      ambition allowed him to gain more power at their expense, as did his ability to portray himself as
      the chosen successor to Lenin. Expect answer to use detailed supporting evidence.

      Nasser
      The ways in which Nasser came to power may include: the unpopularity of the regime of King
      Farouk created a basis for revolt, especially amongst nationalists and those seeking a more
      democratic and progressive state; the discontent among army officers aroused by the lack of
      logistical support given during the Arab-Israeli War of 1948; the continued presence of Britain in
      the Canal Zone. Nasser was a young officer who was very popular amongst the young nationalists
      in the army and was able to mobilize them. The Free Officers Movement, within which Nasser was
      very influential, used a military coup to overthrow the monarchy; the FOM used General Naguib as
      a front man to give the revolution credibility, while Nasser worked to consolidate his power within
      the new government. To achieve this, his methods included the suppression of possible rivals, such
      as the Muslim Brotherhood and the nascent Communist Party and his appeal to the population with
      policies of nationalism and land reform. Also of importance was the conflict between Nasser and
      General Naguib who was forced to resign in 1954 after Nasser had ensured support within Egypt’s
      Revolutionary Command Council and, after an assassination attempt that sealed Nasser’s
      popularity. In 1955, he became President of the RCC but, officially, was not elected until 1956 as
      the President of a single party state. Candidates may also introduce material relating to Egypt’s
      relations with its Arab neighbours, as well as Israel, at this time. This would be relevant, although
      there is no requirement to address foreign policy.
                                                    – 16 –              M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


15.   Assess the importance of the use of force for the establishment of totalitarian control.

      Candidates should understand what is meant by the term totalitarian as an extreme policy which
      seeks to control every aspect of the life of the individual in a state. Responses should address,
      specifically, the role of force in the establishment of totalitarianism, as well as other factors that the
      candidate has chosen. Candidates may choose to address the question using one, or more, single
      party leaders.

      Force may include, but not be limited to: death or exile of opponents; the use of a secret police and
      special tribunals; the use of military power to cow opponents; the incarceration of opponents in
      prisons; various forms of physical intimidation that may include torture; the loss of employment and
      confiscation of property may also be used to enforce compliance with the regime.

      Candidates may also consider the following methods to balance their assessment of “force” such as
      the use of propaganda and censorship; the complete control of media, arts and communications; the
      manipulation of education; the development of leadership cults of a quasi-religious nature; mass
      campaigns to increase support for the regime and to identify dissenters; populist policies to increase
      support for the regime. Additionally, rewards for those who identify dissidents, as well as the use
      of technology to monitor the population may be mentioned along with peer pressure to conform and
      the encouragement of the population to mistrust others.

      Credit responses that also address the use of force in the rise to power of the chosen leader(s).


16.   Assess the importance of the cult of personality in the maintenance of power of one of the
      following: Mao; Castro; Perón.

      Candidates will need to consider the importance of personal qualities, characteristics or abilities of
      the leader relative to other reasons that may have accounted for the maintenance of power.

      The cult of personality could be developed by emphasis on: physical stature and appearance;
      communication skills e.g. speaking or writing; personal reputation as a warrior, patriot, scholar or
      an individual of integrity; the ability to develop and promote ideas and policies; the ability to recruit
      and motivate supporters; religious, family or ethnic connections. His stature in the outside world
      may also play a role, although, as this deals with foreign policy, do not expect this to be mentioned.

      Other factors that may be considered as helping to maintain power may include: the lack of an
      effective opposition; populist economic and social policies; the use of force or repressive strategies;
      censorship of the media; the elimination of opponents; support of religious or ethnic leaders; failure
      of opponents to unify; support from foreign countries or organizations.
                                                   – 17 –             M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


17.   Compare and contrast the treatment of religious groups in two single-party states, each
      chosen from a different region.

      A comparative structure could be used to good effect here as end on accounts are unlikely to offer
      sufficient scope for analysis. It is acceptable for candidates to discuss one group within each of the
      chosen states.

      Factors which may be considered may include: the ability of religious groups to maintain places of
      worship, schools or property; restrictions on public celebrations of faith; exile or expulsion of
      religious groups; denial of civil rights to religious groups; elimination or restriction of the work of
      the clergy through imprisonment, exile or censorship; the creation of an alternate religion by the
      state or the prohibition of all religious practice, as a result of state ideology or policy.

      Alternatively, the use of religion to bolster the power of the state or legitimize the ruling party may
      also be discussed as may the role of religious groups in assisting with state functions such as
      welfare, social services and education.

      If only one state, or two states from the same region, are discussed, mark out of a maximum of
      [7 marks].


18.   Assess the success of either Hitler or Nyerere in implementing their social and economic
      policies.

      Candidates are asked to assess the degree of success achieved by one of the above individuals in the
      implementation of their social and economic policies. Responses should be well-structured and
      analytical in nature and display a clear understanding of what is meant by social and economic
      policies.

      Candidates should identify the policies of their chosen leader in each area and then analyse the
      degree to which they may be considered to have been successful in achieving the goals of the
      policies.

      Examples of social policies may include those relating to racial, religious, family, youth and
      education. Additionally, candidates may discuss policies regarding social class structures, gender
      and racial issues.

      Examples of economic policies may include those relating to employment, trade development, the
      development of new industries, desire for self-sufficiency, changes in standards of living and
      property ownership. Government involvement in the economy, changing methods of production and
      (re-)distribution of wealth may also be relevant.

      If only social or economic policies are dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 4       Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central
              and Eastern European states

19.   Analyse the reasons for the growth of independence movements in one European colonial
      empire.

      Popular choices for this question will be the British, French, Dutch or Portuguese empires.

      The reasons for the growth of independence movements may include: growing feelings of
      nationalism in individual colonies; improvements in the education of the local population; the
      effects of both world wars. Post-war weakening of the financial and military might of the colonial
      power also encouraged independence movements. Also, of importance, were the introduction of
      new ideologies and the example of revolutionary movements elsewhere that encouraged action
      towards independence. In some cases, the leadership of influential individuals inspired local
      populations to demand more freedom, as did changing attitudes towards colonialism. Post-1945,
      the influence of the Cold War, as well as the increased wealth of the colonies, were influential.
      Moreover, colonial powers, increasingly, did not have the strength or desire to actively resist the
      demands of the local population.

      If only one independence movement is addressed, mark out of [12 marks].


20.   “Pakistan owes its independence to the work of Jinnah.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The influence of Jinnah in the creation of the state of Pakistan is undeniable and the factors which
      demonstrate his importance may include: his participation in the early movements for Indian
      independence, along with Gandhi and the Congress party; his break with the Congress Party over
      their methods and the fear that Muslims would become second class citizens in a Hindu dominated
      India; his leadership of the Muslim League, after 1935, increased its power and influence;
      his insistence on the division of India and the establishment of a separate state for Muslims.
      Candidates may also mention his legal and constitutional training, which made him a skilled
      negotiator, both with the Congress Party, and with the British, in constitutional discussions. His
      determination also influenced Britain to recognize that Muslims should have their own homeland
      and that India be divided.

      Candidates may challenge the statement by referring to other factors that may have contributed to
      the establishment of Pakistan such as: the British decision to grant Indian independence as a result
      of the Second World War; British fear of increased violence if Pakistan were not created; a British
      desire to manipulate the balance of power in the region; British desire to maintain good relations
      with Muslim states elsewhere in the world; the recognition of the contribution of Indian Muslims in
      the Second World War.

21.   Assess the factors which enabled one Eastern European state to gain independence from
      Soviet control.

      Candidates must select one state and assess the factors which led to its independence.
      Responses must be well-structured and supported by relevant content. Popular choices will be
      Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia. Yugoslavia post-1945, and up until its expulsion
      from Cominform in 1948, may also be selected as an appropriate example.

      Candidates will have a large number of points from which to choose and these may include: the
      growth of popular resistance movements within the country; economic conditions; the influence of
      different religious groups; resurgent nationalism; the emergence of leaders who were able to rally
      and inspire the public; external support and encouragement, particularly from the West; changing
      attitudes and waning strength of the USSR; media campaigns and increasing flow of external
      information through modern technology; the impact of foreign events, such as the Helsinki
      Accords.

      In the case of Yugoslavia, additional reference might be made to strategic location,
      military strength, the leadership of Tito and the economic assistance offered by the US.

22.   Analyse the importance of either Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam) or Nkrumah (Ghana) to the success
      of the independence movements in their respective countries.

      Responses must be analytical and focus on the importance of the leader in the movement. Simple
      narrative biographical studies or accounts of the independence movement will probably not score
      well.

      Ho Chi Minh
      His contributions to the independence movement include: establishing the Vietnamese Communist
      Party and launching attacks on the French colonial government. He established the Viet Minh to
      resist Japanese military occupation after 1940. He emphasized both nationalism and socialism in
      his policies and sought help from all sectors, including the US, in his struggle with Japan. He
      successfully created a coalition of anti-colonial forces, of all political views, to oppose the French
      and he continued the struggle that led to their departure in 1954. Although he had reservations
      about the subsequent establishment of North and South Vietnam, he led North Vietnam and the
      Vietnamese Communist party until his death. Candidates may also refer to other important factors
      that played a role in Vietnamese independence. These could include: support given by foreign
      countries; the importance of other skilled leaders, such as the military commander General Giap;
      the weakness of the French after the Second World War and failure of the US forces to achieve
      victory. Ho died before Vietnam was fully united under his regime and some candidates may see
      this as an indication that he was not entirely successful, although he left a legacy that was vital to
      the final unification of Vietnam in 1975.

      Nkrumah
      The important contributions of Nkrumah to the independence movement may include: his education
      in economics and political science in the US and Britain that gave him a strong understanding of the
      political process; his reputation as a strong supporter of African independence, as indicated by his
      being a founding member of the Pan-African Congress in 1945; his creation in 1949 of the
      Convention People’s Party that had a radical agenda and adopted tactics of mass action to force the
      pace of independence; his organisation of strikes, protests and demonstrations to pressure the
      government; his arrest by the British that made him a hero and popularised his party.

      The British were forced to recognize his power and placed him in charge of the government in 1951
      and he proceeded to negotiate a new constitution for an independent Ghana in 1954.

      Other factors that contributed to the independence of Ghana may include: the weakness of the UK
      after the Second World War that forced the British government to make new arrangements with
      their colonies; the independence of India increased pressure for independence elsewhere in the
      empire. Britain’s decision not to repress the protests but to work with the leaders to bring about a
      transition to independence as well as; the economic potential of Ghana, aided the process of
      independence, as did the absence of a white minority which might have opposed change.

23.   Why did post-colonial governments in Asia and Africa experience instability after gaining
      their independence?

      Candidates should assess the reasons that post-colonial governments experienced instability in the
      years after independence. These reasons may be both internal and external and include economic,
      social, ethnic, ideological and strategic factors. The reasons that post-colonial governments faced
      difficulties may include: economic problems caused by loss of trade links; reliance on raw materials
      as exports; internal divisions based on ethnic, religious or class conflict. Outbreaks of violence or
      civil war between rival groups may also have been significant, along with inexperienced
      governments leading to waste, corruption and fiscal mismanagement. External threats from
      neighbouring countries, as a result of territorial or other differences, may also have been important
      as well as the introduction of new ideologies and/or the interference of foreign countries or agencies
      leading to internal divisions and conflict.

      Instability may have occurred because of the state of the country when the colonial government
      departed for example, the poor quality infrastructure, influence of the military and, limited
      opportunities for education may have hindered development.

      If only a government from either Asia or Africa is addressed, mark out of [12 marks].


24.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Yugoslavia dissolve?

      There are both short and long-term causes for the dissolution of the Yugoslavian state.

      The long-term causes are related to the historical background and may including Yugoslavia’s
      creation as a multi-ethnic, multi-religious state after the First World War. The various ethnic and
      national groups of the state had long standing differences and antipathies towards each other. These
      differences were increased during the Second World War as some sided with the fascist regimes
      whilst others opposed them. These differences were never resolved, but were controlled by the
      dictatorship of Tito and the Communist party.

      The immediate causes of the dissolution of Yugoslavia may included the death of Tito; the demise
      of the Communist Party as a unifying force; resurgent religious and national consciousness amongst
      the various groups making up the state; renewed awareness of historical antipathy that dated back to
      the First World War and beyond; demands for freedom, democracy and individualism after the
      collapse of the USSR.

      The results of the dissolution of Yugoslavia may include: the creation of several independent states;
      widespread civil war and violence between the states; UN and NATO involvement to maintain
      peace and prevent further violence; the economic impact of dissolution was also significant,
      benefitting some but disadvantaging other states.

      If only reasons or results are dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 5        The Cold War

25.   “Conflicting views about the treatment of Germany were a major cause of the Cold War.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This will be a popular question but should not be treated as a simple analysis of the causes of the
      Cold War. Candidates should present a well-structured analytical response in which they assess the
      importance of the differing views on Germany as a cause of the Cold war. They may challenge the
      statement and introduce other causes, but they must take a position on the importance of differing
      views on Germany between the US and USSR as a major cause of the Cold war.

      The views of the US
      The US had a desire to rebuild the German economy and reunite Germany as a nation and this was
      demonstrated by the disagreement over reparations at Potsdam; the Byrnes speech in 1946 which
      supported a rebuilt German economy; Marshall Plan aid and currency changes in 1948. In addition,
      the decision to unify the three western zones into Bizonia and then Trizonia was a clear statement
      that the US wanted a strong and economically powerful Germany to assist US trade and to act as a
      bulwark against communism. The decision to create the Federal German Republic and to rearm
      Germany after 1951, and to allow them to join NATO in 1955, were all indicative of American
      support for German rebuilding and the lack of fear of a strong Germany. These actions caused fear
      and apprehension in the USSR, which felt that Germany might be used to launch an attack on the
      Soviet territories in Eastern Europe or the USSR itself. Such actions were also seen as an indication
      of possible US imperial motives in Europe.

      The views of the USSR
      The USSR demanded huge reparations both to weaken the German economy and help Soviet post-
      war recovery. The USSR did not wish to encourage German development and refused Marshall
      Aid for East Germany. It was clear that the USSR wanted Germany to remain poor and neutral to
      prevent another attack and, perhaps, to create conditions for a possible Communist takeover. These
      actions increased Western fears of further Soviet expansion in Europe. The Berlin blockade was
      seen as an example of Soviet aggression and hardened Western attitudes toward the USSR, leading
      to the formation of NATO and the further division of Europe into rival blocs.

      There is no endpoint stated but do not expect candidates to go beyond 1949, although it may be that
      some will discuss events up to 1961 and beyond.

26.   By what methods, and with what results, did the USSR impose control on Eastern Europe
      between 1945 and 1956?

      Methods
      Methods used to impose control may include: “liberation” by the Soviet army during the Second
      World War; the continued military presence of Soviet forces in all countries after the end of the
      war; Soviet military intervention to suppress uprising and protests – East Germany 1 the USSR;
      intimidation, such as the Show Trials of 1948 and after; the elimination of rival political groups or
      individuals; the, use of propaganda and censorship; the creation of organizations such as
      Cominform and Comecon, that extended Soviet influence and control; the elimination of, or close
      control over, all social and economic groups that might oppose the USSR, including churches.

      Results
      These could include: the creation of a Soviet controlled Eastern Bloc of states to support the USSR
      militarily and economically; the establishment of a buffer zone in case of invasion; the
      impoverishment of Eastern Europe as it was denied Marshall Aid and was exploited economically
      by the USSR; the establishment of Soviet style totalitarian governments; the suppression of
      churches; the persecution of religious leaders. Candidates may also mention protest movements
      that emerged in East Germany, Poland and Hungary against poverty and loss of freedom. Eastern
      European states were forced to become allies of the USSR through the Warsaw Pact of 1955.
      Overall, the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe raised tensions with the West and contributed to
      the continuation of the Cold War.

      If only methods or results are dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

27.   Analyse the reasons for, and the impact of, changes in US–Chinese relations in the 1970s.

      Candidates must address both reasons for, and the impact of, changed US–Chinese relations.

      US reasons
      American motives for improved relations: the need for help from China in ending the Vietnam War;
      fear of growing Soviet nuclear capability; concerns about Soviet ambitions in Africa and Asia; the
      need for a strategy to encourage the Soviets to reduce tensions and enter the détente process (a US–
      China relationship would frighten the Soviets and force them to negotiate arms control agreements);
      changing US views on Taiwan that reduced American hostility to China; Nixon and Kissinger were
      practitioners of Realpolitk and prepared to overlook ideological differences in the interests of the
      US.

      China’s reasons
      Chinese reasons for changing its relationship with the US were based on: its growing fear of the
      USSR, following the outbreak of armed conflict between the two powers in 1969; China’s
      weakness after the Cultural Revolution and its need for economic support, as well as a possible
      alliance; its belief that the USSR was considered a much greater enemy than the US; Mao’s
      impression that he could negotiate with Nixon.

      Results for the US
      The US began to trade with China and the Nixon visit, in 1972, signalled a new era. The US also
      accepted the “one-China” policy as a goal for the future and received some assistance in ending the
      Vietnam War. Improved relations with China also allowed the US to put pressure on the Soviet
      Union to enter into negotiations on a variety of issues. Domestically, the China trip increased the
      popularity of Nixon and contributed to his re-election in 1972. Cold War tensions were also
      reduced for the US as China was now no longer considered an enemy or threat, as it had been
      previously. The United States gained the potential for a strategic advantage against the USSR and
      the opportunity to profit from the sale of arms etc to China. Diplomatic relations with China were
      resumed in 1979.

      Results for China
      The results for China included: increased security in her disputes with the USSR as it would be
      inclined to be more conciliatory towards a China that was longer isolated internationally;
      a resolution of the Taiwan issue became a possibility; China could look forward to improvements in
      her economy through trade with and investment from the US; China joined the United Nations and
      took its seat on the Security Council.

      General results
      This was a revolution in the Cold War that made it a three sided game and the USSR would be at a
      serious disadvantage if the US and China cooperated. US policy towards China encouraged the
      USSR to enter into détente, to begin the disarmament process and to assist the US with their exit
      from Vietnam. The US initiative also complicated Soviet foreign policy and weakened their
      position overall.

28.   Assess the impact of the Cold War on the economies of two countries, each chosen from a
      different region.

      The economic effects of the Cold War may include: impact on foreign trade either by expanding or
      limiting it; increased government spending for armaments, wars and defence; increased government
      intervention in the economy to ensure production of specific goods or to control access to strategic
      materials; the opportunity for access to loans and economic support from other countries; the loss of
      foreign aid and financial support, as funds were diverted to Cold War purposes; costs to repair
      physical destruction/reconstruction in areas where wars had taken place; changes in the economic
      system as a result of adherence to new ideologies, changing focus of economic activity in the
      country.

      The specific effects and the supporting content will vary with the countries chosen. Responses must
      focus on economic impact, however, be analytical and supported by relevant content.

      If only one country is chosen, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks]. If two countries are chosen
      from the same region, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

29.   Analyse the impact of either Gorbachev or Reagan on the course of the Cold War in
      the 1980s.

      Candidates are asked to analyse how one of the above individuals influenced the direction and
      development of the Cold War in the 1980s. Candidates should focus on how the decisions of the
      chosen individual had an impact on the nature, and evolution of the Cold War.

      The impact of Reagan may include: his determination to move from détente to a more aggressive
      confrontation towards the Soviet Union in an attempt to weaken and ultimately undermine its
      power; his determination to increase US armaments dramatically and devote large sums of money
      to projects such as Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI) (or Star Wars) for missile defence. The
      USSR, meanwhile, were under increased economic pressure as they did not have the economic
      resources to compete and, furthermore, Reagan increased aid to Eastern European states in an
      attempt to undermine Soviet power in these countries. Reagan also increased aid to the mujahadin
      rebels in Afghanistan in an attempt to further weaken Soviet power and prestige and to make a
      Soviet victory in the war increasingly unlikely.

      More US missiles were deployed in Europe as part of a confrontation strategy to restore American
      power and prestige. Reagan was trying to win the Cold War by using American economic power to
      dominate the USSR. He also established a more aggressive attitude in US policy by identifying the
      Soviet Union as the “evil empire” and, inevitably, the Cold War became increasingly
      confrontational and the fear of conflict increased. This new American attitude posed a serious
      challenge for Mikhail Gorbachev when he became leader in 1985. The Soviet withdrawal from its
      attempt to compete with the US and its surrender of its world wide influence under Gorbachev by
      1991 are attributed by some historians to the policies of Ronald Reagan, making him the individual
      who brought an end to the Cold War by forcing a change in Soviet policy.

      The impact of Mikhail Gorbachev may be discussed with reference to his announcement of “New
      Thinking” in foreign affairs, which stated that the world was an interdependent place and that the
      traditional Soviet policies of confrontation were redundant and unrealistic. He also abandoned
      traditional Soviet policies, such as the export of communism and the support of revolutionary
      movements abroad, which had helped create or exacerbate the Cold War. He renounced the
      Brezhnev Doctrine and this contributed to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, signalled
      by the collapse of the Berlin Wall. Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the end of support for
      Communist regimes, such as Cuba, also alleviated tension. Gorbachev withdrew the Soviet Union
      from many areas in order to concentrate on internal social and economic issues, which had become
      critical. He was determined in his support of nuclear disarmament (especially after Chernobyl) and
      his influence on the direction of the Cold War is clear, in that he worked to reduce tensions by
      changing traditional policy and offering a new attitude. This in effect removed the premise on
      which the Cold War had been based from the Western perspective. The USSR was no longer an
      aggressive imperial power and therefore the confrontation, begun in 1945, was at an end. Some
      historians argue that Gorbachev had the most important influence on the direction of the Cold War,
      because of his decisions to change policies that had been in place for many years.

30.   Assess the impact of the Cold War on two non-aligned states, each chosen from a different
      region.

      Students should understand what is meant by the term non-aligned. These nations were
      occasionally referred to as the neutral nations to indicate that they were not linked to either side in
      the Cold War.

      The most prominent non-aligned states would include India, Egypt, Indonesia, Yugoslavia, Cuba as
      well as a number of African and Asian nations.

      The impact of the Cold War on these nations may include: economic effects such as trade, offers of
      financial support or aid in development; access to technology; opportunities to sell raw materials to
      the aligned states; increased defence costs in an increasingly confrontational world as a means to
      protect independence and neutrality. Non-aligned countries were also subjected to increased media
      and cultural pressures by the contending sides, hoping to gain their allegiance or support. They
      could be in strategic danger if one of their regional opponents received support from one of the
      major power blocs. Their leaders, at times, gained increased prestige and influence as mediators of
      international disputes or as models of more reasonable attitudes in international affairs.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks]. If two states from the same
      region are chosen, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
