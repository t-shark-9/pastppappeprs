                                                SECTION A

Prescribed subject 1           The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

These questions relate to the battle of Siffin and negotiations between Ali ibn Abi Talib and Mu„awiya ibn
Abi Sufyan.

1.    (a)   Identify the key points made in Source D concerning the sources of dispute
            between Ali and his Iraqi allies, and Mu„awiya and his Syrian allies.                [3 marks]

             The Iraqi factions had gained a certain independence in the time of Uthman. The Syrian
              factions wanted to have a similar arrangement;
             The Syrians opposed Ali because they thought that a strong caliph was more likely to
              reduce their independence;
             It was not a dispute about who was to be the ruler, but about political and monetary
              concerns between Ali, Mu„awiya and their respective factions.

        Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


     (b)    What is the message conveyed by the images in Source E?                             [2 marks]

               Since his death to the present day, Ali has continued to be a revered figure;
               Ali‟s alleged burial places are the sites of large and important shrines;
               These shrines, named after Ali, are considered holy centres of pilgrimage;
               His final burial place is disputed.

        Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about relations
     between Ali, Mu„awiya, and their respective allies.                         [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources mention that Ali‟s allies were not united;
      Both sources mention that a religious issue was a cause of division in Ali‟s forces;
      Both sources mention the Battle of Siffin, which involved Mu„awiya and his Syrian supporters
       versus Ali and his Iraqi supporters, and explain possible reasons for the outcome.

     For “contrast”
      Source A states that the reason for arbitration was a general dislike of the fighting; Source B
       claims that the Syrians started to negotiate because they were losing the battle;
      Source A states that factions within Ali‟s army rebelled against him of their own accord;
       Source B states that Mu„awiya tried to divide Ali‟s forces by putting copies of the Qur‟an on
       their lances;
      Source A mentions two envoys who negotiated a signed truce prior to the negotiations;
       Source B does not mention this;
      Source A mentions the Kharijites Affair; Source B does not.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative element is
     only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are used with a good
     running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of [4–5 marks]. For the
     maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running, comparison and contrast.
     If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of
     Source C and Source D for historians studying the leadership of Ali.                        [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        A narrative compilation from a well-known, medieval Arabic source.

     Purpose:       To give an account of the history of the First Civil War.

     Value:         Al-Tabari was a Muslim who wrote a vast history. He is one of the earliest
                    historians of the Islamic Empire. The source concentrates on the First Civil War.

     Limitations:   Al-Tabari was not a contemporary observer. He was writing from within his own
                    frames of reference which may have been biased. The source is an English
                    translation and may not necessarily be accurate. Al-Tabari was the court historian of
                    the Abbasids and may have a bias against Mu„awiya.

     Source D
     Origin:        An academic book dealing with medieval regional and religious history, first
                    published in the UK in 1986.

     Purpose:       To provide a historically critical interpretation of the first four centuries of Islamic
                    history.

     Value:         A modern and up-to-date account written by an established historian of Islam, whose
                    book is a product of much research and reflection.

     Limitations:   The author is distant in time and place from the events about which he writes.
                    He was writing from within his own frames of reference which may have been
                    biased.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, assess to what extent they are
     important for understanding the reasons for conflict between Ali and
     Mu„awiya.                                                                               [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source emphasizes the attempts by both sides to resolve the dispute and stop the
                  fighting by means of negotiation. It claims that the key issue was about the
                  leadership of the entire Islamic community (Umma). It blames the split in Ali‟s
                  army on the Kharijites, who are reported to have taken an absolutely
                  uncompromising position that did not allow any room for political arbitration.

     Source B:     This source emphasizes the attempts by Mu„awiya and the Syrian factions to
                   exacerbate existing splits within Ali‟s army. He states that the army was composite
                   and was not made up entirely of Iraqis.

     Source C:     The speech, which is said to be that of Ali himself, implies that Mu„awiya and his
                   supporters were misleading the Muslims and had rejected Islam. It was only because
                   of this that Ali was forced to take action to restore order.

     Source D:     This source emphasizes the human, rather than the divine, dimensions to the conflict.
                   The author thus characterizes it as a regional power struggle for greater levels of
                   political and monetary control.

     Source E:     This source shows a strong division in the Islamic world, with the east, including
                   Iraq, supporting Ali until today.

     Own knowledge
     Longer-term causes: ultimately these could be traced back to the succession problem after the death
     of Prophet Muhammad. However, candidates should not attempt to explain this except in terms of
     historical context. Rather, they should focus on more immediate political causes following the
     murder of the caliph Uthman at the hands of disaffected soldiers in the year before the battle and
     negotiation at Siffin. Some factions, especially from the Umayya clan to whom both Mu„awiya and
     Uthman belonged, felt that Ali had not done enough to bring Uthman‟s killers to justice.

     Candidates should also be aware of increasing regional tension in an expanding Islamic empire:
     Mu„awiya was the powerful provincial governor based in Damascus, and had strong support there
     among the Syrian soldiers and the Umayya clan; Ali had support in Iraq among the Arab soldiers
     who still had grievances over the division of spoils. Ali also had support from among factions from
     Medina and from those who had opposed Uthman.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum [8 marks]
     expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the
     sources used.

Prescribed Subject 2     The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These questions relate to the events known as “The Sicilian Vespers” during the rule of Charles I of
Anjou, King of Sicily, in 1282.

5.   (a)   Why, according to Source A, did The Sicilian Vespers occur?                      [3 marks]

            There were high taxes in Sicily;
            Sicily was ignored and overlooked by Charles I of Anjou;
            There was a conspiracy against Charles I of Anjou by John of Procida, a servant of
             Peter of Aragon;
            The Sicilian rebels called on Peter of Aragon for help, and he invaded;
            The invasion by the Aragonese intensified the revolt, helping to make it successful.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E about the causes of the Sicilian
           Vespers?                                                                  [2 marks]

            That an assault by a French official, against a Sicilian woman, caused the revolt;
            That the assault took place on a religious festival, Easter Tuesday, 31 March 1282, which
             made it even more unacceptable;
            That the assault took place near a church, making it sacrilegious;
            That the French treated the Sicilians with contempt and cruelty, and were oppressive;
            That the French were armed and that the Sicilian woman was an unarmed victim.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

6.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about the causes of
     The Sicilian Vespers.                                                           [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources refer to an Aragonese “conspiracy” or plot against Charles I of Anjou;
      Both sources mention Peter of Aragon‟s opposition to Angevin rule in Sicily;
      Both sources mention the legend that John of Procida was a go-between in the plot;
      Both sources mention the role of Emperor Michael of Constantinople, and his attitudes;
      Both sources mention that Charles ignored the island of Sicily, and had not visited it since 1271.

     For “contrast”
      Source A states that Charles I of Anjou was merely a nuisance to the Aragonese; Source B shows
       that the Aragonese actively involved the Emperor of Constantinople in a plot against Charles;
      Source A regards the role of the Aragonese in the revolt as being less important than the actions
       of the Sicilian people; Source B regards the Aragonese as the main actors in the revolt;
      Source A mentions that the revolt was already underway when Peter of Aragon landed; Source B
       makes no mention of this;
      Source B mentions that Emperor Michael gave Peter of Aragon money; Source A makes no
       mention of this;
      Source A mentions the role of taxation as a cause of the revolt; Source B makes no mention
       of this;
      Source B claims that Charles was an able and conscientious ruler; Source A makes no mention
       of this;
      Source A mentions the significant role of the Sicilian people in the Sicilian Vespers; Source B
       makes no mention of them.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative element is
     only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are used with a good
     running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of [4–5 marks]. For the
     maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running, comparison and contrast.
     If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of [4 marks].

7.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of
     Source C and Source D for historians studying the origins of The Sicilian Vespers. [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        A collection of accounts of events in French History, published in France in 1835, by
                    François Guizot.

     Purpose:       To explain events in France‟s history during the Middle Ages, up to the thirteenth
                    century, for a French readership.

     Value:         It was compiled by a university historian, using French medieval sources. Writing
                    several centuries after the events he describes, Guizot had access to a broad range of
                    sources.

     Limitations:   Guizot was a French politician as well as being a historian, who compiled his
                    account from French sources alone. The source is not specifically about Sicily, but a
                    general survey of French history, seen from a French perspective. As a politician,
                    Guizot‟s view may have been influenced by patriotic feelings. The extracts are
                    adapted from the original text.

     Source D
     Origin:        A history of The Sicilian Vespers, published in Italy in 1846, by Michele Amari.

     Purpose:       To give a full account of The Sicilian Vespers, in Italian.

     Value:         It was written by an Italian historian, using Italian medieval sources. As he was
                    writing several centuries after the events he describes, Amari had access to a broad
                    range of sources. His work is focussed entirely on the Sicilian Vespers.

     Limitations:   Amari was an Italian politician and patriot, who used predominantly Italian sources.
                    His account of The Sicilian Vespers is written entirely from an Italian perspective.
                    His patriotism may have influenced his historical understanding.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

8.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in Source D that
     the “cruel and rapacious” nature of Charles I of Anjou‟s rule caused The Sicilian
     Vespers.                                                                          [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:     This source emphasizes the importance of the Sicilian people‟s role in the uprising
                   of 1282, noting that it was a spontaneous popular uprising. It also mentions that
                   there was a 150 % tax rise just before the revolt, and that Charles‟s “greatest
                   mistake” had been to ignore Sicily after 1271. It states that the Sicilian rebels made
                   desperate pleas for Peter‟s help, suggesting the unpopularity of Charles‟
                   government. It also notes that Aragonese intervention helped to prolong the revolt,
                   and change it into a war against kings.

     Source B:       This source emphasizes the importance of a conspiracy by Charles I of Anjou‟s
                     foreign enemies. It focuses on the ambitions of Peter of Aragon, and the diplomacy
                     he conducted to gain the support of Emperor Michael of Constantinople. It also
                     shows that Charles was an able and conscientious ruler, who lived near his subjects,
                     and whose officials were not oppressive. However, it also notes that Charles ruled
                     Sicily from Naples, and that he failed to visit the island after 1271, neglecting its
                     economy.

     Source C:       This source claims that Peter of Aragon lied to the Pope when he said that his fleet
                     was sailing to Africa, whereas in fact it was destined for Sicily. It also states that
                     Peter invaded Sicily, forcing the kingdom to submit to him, and that he crowned
                     himself as king. It notes that Charles was severe in punishing the Neapolitans who
                     revolted against him, and that he failed to attend a battle that he had arranged with
                     Peter.

     Source D:       This source claims that the cruelty and rapacity of Charles‟ rule were the main
                     reasons for the uprising, and that the Sicilians rose up before Peter of Aragon‟s
                     invasion. Also that evidence for a conspiracy between Charles‟ Sicilian enemies
                     and Peter of Aragon was “not confirmed by any valid historical source”.
                     It emphasizes the popular opposition within Sicily against French rule, and the
                     importance of the assault on a Sicilian woman as the spark for the revolt.

     Source E:       This source depicts the attack on a Sicilian woman by a French official, near the
                     church of Santo Spirito, Palermo, Sicily, on 31 March 1282, as the cause of the
                     revolt. It shows the Sicilian people as victims of French oppression. It shows how
                     there was also a religious dimension, as the assault occurred near a church on a holy
                     day, Easter Tuesday.

     Own knowledge
     The 1282 Sicilian revolt was due to a combination of internal pressures, and the actions of Charles I
     of Anjou‟s external enemies.

     During his reign, Charles had raised heavy taxes in Sicily, including a new “General Subvention”
     and a re-issue of coinage that profited the crown. In order to undertake his military expeditions in
     Tunisia and against Constantinople, Charles had conscripted large numbers of sailors and soldiers
     from his lands, which was a very unpopular measure.
                                            – 11 –             M12/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Charles also relied on non-Sicilian advisers, whether French or mainland Italians.
Some Sicilian-born officials, such as John of Procida, had abandoned the kingdom and took up
service with Charles‟ enemy, Peter of Aragon. Charles himself lived in Naples, and was viewed as
a distant and out-of-touch ruler by many of his Sicilian subjects, especially by the nobility. He had
further angered them by taking much land back into royal control.

The incident on 31 March 1282, when a French official assaulted a Sicilian woman at the church of
Santo Spirito, outside Palermo, ignited grievances that had been growing for many years.

Charles I of Anjou also had external enemies. In 1262 Peter of Aragon had married Constance, the
daughter of the former Hohenstaufen King, Manfred, making him a rival to Charles for the Sicilian
throne. Charles‟ execution of Conradin, the last male Hohenstaufen heir in 1268, strengthened
Peter‟s reasons for supporting a revolution in Sicily. Peter and Charles also had conflicting
strategic interests – both vying for influence and power in Provence, Sardinia and Tunis. By the
early 1280s, Peter was in contact with Sicilian enemies of Charles I of Anjou, and may even have
promised them land in the event of a successful revolution.

Another enemy was Emperor Michael of Constantinople. Charles‟ alliance with the Hungarians,
the Serbs and the Bulgarians, and his ambitions to become a power in the Adriatic, put him in
conflict with Constantinople. In 1281, Charles was planning an attack against Constantinople.
Although Emperor Michael died in 1282, he is believed to have had contact with Peter of Aragon
before his invasion of Sicily, and may have supported him with money.
