Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

(b)   (i)    The database will allow teachers to export data to a spreadsheet.

             Explain one reason why teachers would export data from the database
             to a spreadsheet.                                                   [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
              Reason: exported data in spreadsheet format may be shared with
               other users
               Explanation: some users cannot work with a database but do work with a
               spreadsheet or do not have the database software
              Reason: exported data can be shared without having to share all data in
               the database i.e. data to be shared is selected
               Explanation: exported file size smaller / avoid sharing unnecessary data
              Reason: exported data may need calculations
               Explanation: these special functions and formulae are present in
               spreadsheet software and not in database software.

             Do not accept answers that refer to “user friendly” or “easier to use”.
             Award [1 mark] for one reason identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate
             explanation of that reason up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      (ii)   The new database will also require teachers to undertake training to be
             able to use it.

             A local company is offering to train users in the use of the new system.
             The two options proposed are:
              online training
              face-to-face training.

             Contrast the two options.                                                    [4 marks]

(c)   The following screen shows the options this database will have in its online
      version.

      When the system was purchased it was possible to include a Virtual Private
      Network (VPN), giving remote access to teachers to this database, which is
      stored on the school’s server.

      Discuss the impact for the school of the decision to allow teachers remote
      access to the school server.                                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive impacts for the school – “school includes teachers, administrators
      and students”
       school may bring deadlines forward because teachers will be able to work after
        school from home
       school will provide a better service for students if teachers can access students’
        records from home to do follow-ups, upload homework, update the
        calendar etc.

      Negative impacts for the school – “school includes teachers, administrators
      and students”
       some teachers may have difficulty meeting deadlines because their connection
        from home may not be as good as needed to work with the software
       teacher dissatisfaction – there may be more expectation on teachers to work in
        the evenings on school-related tasks
       teachers may request extra compensation because they are expected to work
        from home
       teachers may not feel comfortable with the use of IT and may need training
       school will now have the responsibility to have the system running after school
        hours and provide some support / provision for failure; IT support available
        after school, robust servers, hacker protection
       school will have to provide teachers with the hardware such as laptops and,
        additional software to use the VPN from outside of school
       some teachers may not log out of the network when away from school which
        may present security issues.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   Telemedicine

     (a)   (i)    Define the term real-time communication.                                      [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   communication in which information is received at (or nearly at) the time
                    it is sent
                   is synonymous with “live communication”
                   uses a direct path between the source and the destination
                   data goes from source to destination without being stored anywhere
                   often used for communication between people in different locations.

                  Award [1 mark] for any of the points stated above up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].

           (ii)   After an accident an image of an x-ray of a badly broken leg was taken
                  in bitmap format. To ensure the resolution was clear/high enough for a
                  doctor to see the extent of the injuries, the image size was 12 MB
                  (Megabyte). The connection the doctor will be using has a speed of
                  240 kb/s (kilobit per second).

                  Calculate how long it will take to download an image of each x-ray.
                  (Show your working.)                                                [2 marks]

                  The following calculation must be shown:
                   Conversion to kilobit:
                    12 MB is 12 1024 KB 12 288 KB (Kilobyte),
                    12 288  8  98304 kb (kilobit)
                   Calculation of transfer time:
                    98 304 / 240 = 409.6 seconds (6.83 min / 6 min 49.6 seconds).

                  Or

                  Considering the conversion by 1000 instead of 1024:
                   12 MB = 12 000 000 bytes = 96 000 000 bits (approx)
                   download speed = 240 kb/s = 240 000 bits per second
                   length of time for download = 96 000 000 / 240 000 = 9600 / 24
                    = 400 seconds (approx)
                    = 6.67 min/6 min 40 seconds (approx).

                  Award [1 mark] for the conversion to the same units (e.g. 12 MB to kb,
                  or kb/s to MB/s).
                  Award an additional [1 mark] for the calculation of the transfer time.
                  Accept correct calculations if units are not stated.

(iii) In some cases the technology available in the remote locations will not
      allow for large images to be sent to the hospital.

     Identify two methods to resolve this problem.                                   [2 marks]

     Answers may include:
      compress the image (and save into a different picture format e.g. JPG)
      take a picture again in a different format that has a lower resolution
       (sacrifice resolution for transfer time)
      break down the file into smaller files using appropriate software and send
       individual files separately
      resize the image
      convert the image to a different format (that requires less space e.g. jpeg
       files smaller than png files).

     Do not accept uploading the image to a service such as Flickr so that the
     hospital can download them.
     Award [1 mark] for each of the points stated above up to a maximum of
     [2 marks].

(b)   (i)    Explain one situation in telemedicine that is better suited to real-time
             data transfer and one situation in telemedicine that is better suited to
             store and forward data transfer.                                         [4 marks]

             Answers may include:
             Situation in telemedicine better suited to real-time data transfer:
              doctors guiding an operation in a remote location (robotic operation) –
                he will need to have the information such as blood pressure or oxygen
                levels in blood in real-time during the operation
              an ambulance at an accident – paramedics may need real-time data such
                as heart rate of the patient(s).

             Award [1 mark] for situations similar to those stated above. Award an
             additional [1 mark] for a reason why specific data needs to be transferred
             in real time.

             N.B. In this situation “store and forward” is used to refer to “delayed data
             transfer” where it is saved on a device or server until it can be sent.

             Situation in telemedicine better suited to store and forward data
             transfer:
              doctors in remote locations may not have a permanent internet
                connection – X-ray files, or similar, will be stored at the server and
                transferred when the internet connection is available
              situations that might not need immediate response or do not need to have
                all the participants available simultaneously – data can be digitized, sent
                and transferred only when recipient accepts it for clinical consultation
                rather than for a hospital visit.

             Award [1 mark] for situations similar to those stated above. Award an
             additional [1 mark] for a reason why the specific data needs store and
             forward data transfer.
             Award a maximum of [4 marks] for this question.

      (ii)   Many mobile devices use store and forward to manage data transfer.

             Explain one reason for using store and forward by such devices.                  [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
              messages will be stored until the recipient is available to receive the
               message – the recipient’s cell phone may be turned off or without service
               and the message will be kept in the server until the mobile phone appears
               as available. Otherwise the message would be lost
              exchange server stores messages and prioritizes their delivery
              mobile devices use different networks so routing messages through an
               exchange server allows it to be sent to the destination.

             Award [1 mark] for the point stated up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   In many countries doctors are using videoconferencing to treat patients
      remotely. Evaluate this medical practice.                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
       patients do not have to travel
       doctors do not have to travel
       patients in remote locations have access to experts from around the world
       doctors/nurses/health care workers in remote locations benefit from
        assisting/listening to an expert who will be doing the treatment
       video conferences can be recorded for later review
       more patients may be treated by the same doctor as there is no need for the
        doctor to have to travel between patients.

      Disadvantages
       equipment for videoconferencing is needed
       time may be a problem if doctors are in a different time zone
       doctors do not get to “see” and touch the patient, must trust doctor in remote
        location
       connection may fail and ruin the communication
       results from tests and exams will have to be sent (e.g. emailed/transferred)
        in advance
       some patients may not be familiar with video conferencing, and be less willing
        to describe their symptoms to the doctor.

      Do not accept costs involved in video conferencing systems.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between the IT technical terminology and the terminology related

(b)   Some managers of local businesses have realized that social networking may
      provide new business opportunities and have created company webpages
      on Facebook.

      Explain why companies will use social networking websites to develop new
      business opportunities.                                                  [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       social networking websites can provide updated information frequently, for
        example, a new business opportunity such as informing users of new products
        or the opening of a new office
       social networking websites can keep users interested with latest
        changes/opportunities, for example, a new business opportunity marking the
        business known to more people
       many new potential customers are already using these networks to
        communicate with friends, for example, a new business opportunity providing
        users and potential users of a better or more interesting way of promoting
        products
       social networking sites are free
       social networking sites may have services not offered by websites such as join
        interest groups “like a product”
       social networking sites are used to target specific customers based on age,
        interest, gender etc.
       a presence on social networking sites may encourage customers to go to an
        official business website.

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of
      the topic. There may only be a reference to why companies use social networking
      websites and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

(c)   Although the Facebook page reporting system is not managed by the Lima
      authorities, they are using it to solve the transport problems that happen in
      the city of Lima.

      The Lima authorities are considering implementing an official website for
      reporting transport problems.

      To what extent is a social networking website preferable to an official website
      for reporting transport problems?                                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       official website needs to be maintained and made sure to be working properly –
        additional costs involved
       no website hosting service is needed to store the website if a social networking
        service such as Facebook is used
       people may feel more at ease using a social networking website such as
        Facebook because they use it frequently
       one comment may trigger others and information may be greater on a social
        networking website
       the social networking website is probably used and known by citizens who use
        it for several purposes – an official website would have few uses and may not
        be known by users
       social networking websites such as Facebook already has applications for
        portable devices that are checked by users when they are away from home or
        their office
       comments may not always be true on a social networking website
       people may regard information on an official website as being more reliable or
        legitimate than on a social networking website
       social networking websites may not be available to all users
       some users may not feel comfortable using social networking websites.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

            Award [1 mark] for each task identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   When a user reports an incident, the IT support staff have to create a log of
      the incident and then make decisions about the course of action to be taken.

      The information services department needs to classify incidents as major
      or minor. Explain three criteria that the information services department
      could use to reach this decision.                                         [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       does it affect the core business of the university? + reason why the work of the
        IS Dept affects the core business of the university, may relate to the part of the
        business affected
       does it affect more than n users? + reason why the number of users makes the
        incident a priority
       how senior is the complainant? + reason why the seniority of the complainant
        may make the issue a priority
       does it affect the image/reputation of the university? + reason why the image /
        reputation of the university may be affected
       is it intermittent? + reason why an intermittent problem may be more serious
        than one that happens, but does not seem to resolve itself
       the time required to complete the repair + reason why the particular incident
        needs a speedy resolution (or not)

(c)   The computer science department wants to run its computers using a
      different network operating system to that used by the rest of the university.

      To what extent should it be the responsibility of the information services
      department to provide support for this?                                    [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       the operating system might be needed as a teaching resource – it might be an
        essential service for them
       the operating system might create a system conflict – it might create problems
        for other users (investigation of possible problems)
       the operation system might bring security issues to the rest of the university –
        it might create problems for the university
       the CS Dept might need hardware (computers, cables, hubs, … ) that belong to
        the university – information services may have to provide the equipment
       the support might have a cost (equipment, staff, software) that the IS
        Department does not have
       the support might require training – the IS Department might not know how to
        do this and cannot use their resources to learn / train others
       the support might take time – the IS Department might be dealing with too
        many incidents in other key areas and cannot deal with a different one that
        involves only one dept
       the CS dept might want to do this as a private investigation project –
        information services would want to keep this network isolated from the others
        to avoid problems /conflicts / security issues.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology and the terminology related to social and ethical impacts.

(b)   A bank is considering introducing new IT systems to support the
      processing of customers’ accounts. Two cases where these systems would be
      applied are:
       processing customers’ monthly bank statements
       detecting fraudulent bank transactions.

      Contrast the suitability of using fuzzy logic in these two cases.                      [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Bank statements – fuzzy logic not suitable
       account data is not subjective
       an account is either overdrawn or it is not
       no validity in assigning account data to a set on the basis of a rough assessment.

      Fraudulent transactions – fuzzy logic is suitable
       many variables to be considered
       a matter of judgment whether a transaction is suspect
       suitable situation for the system to learn the characteristics of a customer
       example such as “is a withdrawal in another country out of character for
        this customer?”

      Mark in 3 stages:
       Award [1 mark] if the candidate states whether the use of fuzzy logic is not
        suitable for processing a bank statement. Award an additional [1 mark] for a
        description of the unsuitability of this case.

       Award [1 mark] if the candidate states whether the use of fuzzy logic is suitable
        for detecting fraudulent bank transactions. Award an additional [1 mark] for
        a description of the suitability of this case.

       Award up to [2 marks] if the candidate gives an account of the differences
        between the suitability/unsuitability of using fuzzy logic in the two cases
        referring to both of them throughout. There is appropriate ITGS terminology
        in the response.

      The maximum mark for this question is [6 marks].

(c)   Computer systems are being developed based on fuzzy logic to predict
      market trends for investors.

      To what extent is it sensible for an investor to trust such systems instead of
      his own judgment?                                                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
       system can be supplied with a large data set
       no likelihood of it forgetting data
       judgments will be based on evidence from past events
       system can learn from its mistakes
       unbiased decisions.

      Disadvantages
       there are more variables than can be adequately programmed
       the human element may be important
       e.g. knowledge of the personalities / behaviour of board members of companies
        may be good indicators of future performance
       new unexpected information may not be reacted to by a computer system
       gut feeling may sometimes be more successful than analysis
       possibility of bias from developer
       past performance may not be a guide to future returns.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between the IT technical terminology and the terminology related
      to social and ethical impacts.

7.   Expert car repairs

     (a)   (i)    Sensors are used to provide data to show that the emission control
                  system is not working properly.

                  Identify two sensors that could provide this data.                             [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   oxygen
                   gas such as CO2, NO2 / specific pollutant sensor
                   temperature
                   water / moisture
                   light
                   pressure
                   electrical
                   air flow (indicates a parameter may be outside of tolerance).

                  Award [1 mark] for each sensor identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Many cars have a traction control system to prevent the wheels from
                  spinning if the accelerator is pressed too hard. This is controlled by the
                  engine control unit (ECU).

                  Identify four different ways in which the software in the ECU could
                  carry this out.                                                     [4 marks]

                  Answers may include any four of the following ways:
                   sensors are used to capture information such as accelerator pressure,
                    wheel rotation, variations in wheel rotation
                   information is sent to ECU
                   preset range of acceptable values for parameter(s) identified such as
                    those above are stored in memory in ECU
                   if the parameter(s) is outside of the acceptable value then
                   the traction control system is engaged / the ECU could
                   action is taken such as “cutting the link” between the accelerator and the
                    wheels and the wheels or reducing fuel intake.

                  Award [1 mark] for one way identified within each group up to a maximum
                  of [4 marks].

                  Do not accept the second case from any group.

(b)   When the mechanic carries out the first diagnostic test on a car, a series of
      diagnostic trouble codes (DTC) are produced (see Figure 1 below).

      Explain why a mechanic would need to use an expert system in order to
      proceed with repairing a car.                                         [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      The expert system:
       holds more information than a human can (provides access to knowledge
        compiled from the experience of many experts the issue is more quality
        than quantity)
       provides a code that may indicate a component in the car where there is a fault
        (the code is the link to the expert system inference engine (decision making))
       can ask questions that will help it find probable causes of the problem and then
       suggest the most likely cause of the problem
       can, if the solution provided does not solve the problem the expert system ask
        further questions to try to diagnose the fault
       may provide a more rapid method of diagnosing / finding the fault or act as a
        way of confirming (or not) the diagnosis of the mechanic
       will reduce time spent in the repair of the car
       reduce the labour costs to the car owner
       increase the income of the mechanic / garage owner.

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the
      reason is not clear. Uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4 marks]
      A partial explanation of the reasons why a mechanic would need to use an expert
      system. Some examples are used within the response.

      [5–6 marks]
      A clear and detailed explanation of why a mechanic would use an expert system.
      Relevant examples are used throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS
      terminology throughout the response.

(c)   Discuss the impacts on motorists and car repair shops of the use of diagnostic
      expert systems to investigate problems in cars.                                [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive impacts
       training of the staff – upskilling – staff will become more knowledgeable
       the system will allow the garage to work more effectively / efficiently
       expert systems will detect finer problems than a human mechanic can
       shows proof the car owner what needed to be repaired, reducing the chances of
        being overcharged by the garage
       might identify other problems or factors that need to be fixed as well?

      Negative impacts
       reliability of the machines must be acceptable
       cost of machines may outweigh financial advantages gained
       limitation of the knowledge base – not all situations will be diagnosed
       updating the knowledge base – this requires IT skills and possible additional
        expense
       every model is different – this may limit the usefulness of the system
       accuracy and currency of the knowledge base
       de-skilling of staff – mechanics might eventually be incapable of carrying out
        traditional repairs.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
