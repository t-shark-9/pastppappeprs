                                             SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe two below the line promotion methods that Roberto could use.               [4 marks]

           Below the line promotional methods that AH could use include:
            Direct mail could be used to inform customers about delivery services, contact
             details, menu, prices and promotions.
            Leaflets and 2 for 1 offers could be handed out in the neighborhood of the
             restaurant. AH could offer 2 for 1s either promoted on the leaflets, or at
             point-of-sale, or through other means.
            Loyalty programs for frequent customers could be introduced to allow special
             discounts or free meals after a number of visits. These could also encourage
             brand loyalty and provide AH with a database that could be used for further
             promotions.
            Birthday clubs, special date promotions and refer-a-friend tactics could be set
             up to increase the number of customers.
            Selling internal merchandising such as special barbeque utensils and aprons
             with the restaurant’s logo/name to enhance brand awareness.
            Accept any other relevant below the line promotion method described.

      Award marks as follows:

      [1 mark] for each appropriately labelled axis – up to a maximum of [2 marks].
      [1 mark] for an appropriately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.
      [1 mark] for an appropriately drawn and labelled total cost curve.
      [1 mark] for the identification of the break-even level of output.

      Award [0 marks] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than
      [3 marks] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to scale.

      Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the break-even point and
      label the arrow. However, accept as an “appropriately labelled” break-even point
      a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point provided that the line is
      labelled “break-even point”.

(d)   Using the position map, analyse how AH can differentiate itself from its main
      competitors.                                                                  [5 marks]

      Roberto has constructed a position map to determine where his restaurant stands
      vis-à-vis the other competing restaurants in the street. According to the position
      map, AH is competing with restaurants A, B and C in the high quality high priced
      segment, meanwhile restaurant D is all alone in the economy segment offering an
      inferior service.

      The map suggests that AH has a distinct position in the market. On the one hand,
      restaurant B is perceived as offering services with the same quality than AH but at
      a higher price. Restaurant C on the other hand, is perceived as offering services at
      the same price than AH but with a lower quality. Restaurant A in turn, is
      perceived as providing better quality services but substantially more expensive.

      Roberto could design his future promotions so as to emphasize AH’s distinct
      position in the market. His restaurant is perceived as offering good quality service
      for good value for money. Future promotions could aim at showing that his
      restaurant is cheaper than competitor B for the same service quality, and better
      quality service than competitor C for the same price.

      Another option for AH is to try to change its market position to a “less crowded”
      position to differentiate more effectively from restaurants B and C. It could aim
      at the premium segment such as restaurant A, or inversely, at the economy
      segment like restaurant D. However, these alternatives would imply competing
      with restaurants A or C which are already positioned in their market segments.
      It could also entail several risks such as losing customers or drastic changes to the
      restaurant’s image.

      Roberto should then take advantage of AH’s current position to deepen its
      differentiation over its competitors. Future promotions should emphasize AH’s
      distinct position on quality service and price.

      Accept any other substantiated analysis.

2.   (a)   Identify two advantages and two disadvantages of changing the legal
           structure of BS to a private limited company.                                         [4 marks]

           Advantages could include:
            shareholders have limited liability
            capital can easily be raised by having more shareholders
            control of the business cannot be lost as all shareholders must agree to sell to
             new shareholders
            the business will continue even if one of the owners dies.

           Disadvantages could include:
            profits must be shared among shareholders
            the legal costs of setting up this type of organization
            shares cannot be sold to the public
            financial information becomes public.

           N.B. Some candidates may say that control of ownership could be lost even if
           this is actually not the case in the scenario of this stimulus. If the business
           changes from a sole trader to a private limited company, Aroon can control the
           sale of shares such that he will always have a controlling interest in the company.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct and relevant advantage identified up to a
           maximum of [2 marks] and [1 mark] for each correct and relevant disadvantage
           identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR) based on their calculations to parts (b) and
      (c).

      The results of the investment appraisal calculations indicate that, if shrimp prices
      remain high, purchasing a new boat will be a positive investment. The payback
      period of 5 years is also a short period of time, especially since Aroon believes
      that the useful life exceeds 7 years. If, after 2 years, prices fall to their pre-2011
      levels, the investment becomes negative. The payback on the loan now extends to
      12.5 years, which means that the boat would not be paid for until after his
      retirement.

      The candidate’s response is somewhat general (the candidate does not support the
      answer with specific references to the rates of return and payback periods), or too
      optimistic (the candidate does not make some commentary on the problematical
      nature of projections, which tends to be optimistic and which cannot anticipate the
      unexpected).

(e)   Using Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory, analyse Aroon’s motivation to
      acquire the additional shrimp boat.                                                       [5 marks]

      The acquiring of an additional shrimp boat is a difficult decision for Aroon and
      his family. If shrimp prices remain high for several years, the boat can be paid off
      quickly.

      There are risks to the move. If shrimp prices return to pre-2011 levels quickly,
      Aroon could be paying for the boat for many years. He would have to renegotiate
      the loan, and his bank may not be happy with this situation and could raise the
      interest rate. It could also mean that Aroon and Kanya have to delay their
      retirement, which they may not want to do and for Aroon this may cause
      difficulties given the physical demands of shrimping. Why would he want to take
      a risk of jeopardizing the comfort and prosperity he currently enjoys to buy
      another boat? Why does he just not enjoy the post-2011 profits and bank as much
      money as possible until shrimp prices fall to pre-2011 levels?

      According to Maslow, humans must first satisfy their physiological needs then
      their safety needs, and then their need for love and belonging. Aroon has met
      these needs – he runs a profitable business with his wife. The explanation for risk
      taking could well lie in the next stages of Maslow’s hierarchy: the need to gain the
      respect and esteem of others and, finally, self-actualization – the realization of full
      potential. Perhaps Aroon wants to see his standing in the shrimping community
      go up, which it certainly would if he successfully increased his fleet.
      Other shrimpers would believe him to be a successful businessman and Aroon
      himself would feel not merely competent but successful.

      Given the risks he is considering, though, the motivation may even be greater.
      For Aroon, self-actualization, reaching his full potential (in his eyes) may be not
      merely providing for his family now, but also in providing for the future of his
      sons and their families by leaving each son his own boat.

                                              SECTION B

3.   (a)   Identify two features of quality control.                                                [2 marks]

           Features of quality control could include:
            it is a set of procedures intended to ensure a certain level of quality in a product
             or service
            it emphasizes testing of products to uncover defects
            it is product orientated instead of process orientated
            quality control activities are usually performed after the production has been
             completed
            it is reactive rather than proactive
            accept any other relevant feature.


           N.B. Some candidates may define quality control. If in their definition,
           two appropriate features are identified, award marks for identification of those
           features.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct and relevant feature of quality control identified
           up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain one advantage and two disadvantages to Hands of using a piece rate
           rewards package for its workers.                                                         [6 marks]

           A piece rate reward package (scheme) is such that workers are paid purely on
           results.

           Advantages for Hands could include the following:
            It could increase motivation among workers and therefore increase
             productivity.
            It helps to reward extra productivity. This means that efficient and fast
             craftswomen who make an extra effort will be rewarded for it.
            It allows some labour costs flexibility. If the business faces a downturn in
             sales, labour cost can be easily adapted to the circumstances as craftswomen
             are only paid if they produce.
            Accept any other relevant advantage.

           Disadvantages for Hands could include the following:
            Craftswomen may worry about losing pay if production and sales are lowered.
            The quality of knitted items could be affected as workers mainly focus
             on production. This could negatively affect sales and threaten Hands’
             permanence in sophisticated and competitive markets.
            It could be more complicated to administrate than other payment schemes, as
             each craftswoman will see its wage calculated every payroll. This could lead
             to an increased administrative cost for the business.
            Innovation and group work could be discouraged as the worker’s main focus is
             quantity produced. This can particularly affect a business in the fashion
             industry like Hands, where creation of new designs is essential.
            Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Mark as 2+2+2.

      [2 marks] are awarded for one advantage and [4 marks] are awarded for
      two disadvantages.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct and relevant advantage/disadvantage identified.
      Award an additional [1 mark] for a relevant explanation of the advantage/
      disadvantage up to a maximum of [6 marks].

(c)   Analyse two challenges that Hands may have faced entering into international
      markets.                                                                     [5 marks]

      The entrance into international markets may have placed several challenges on
      Hands.

      For example:
       Hands may have faced strong competition from other hand knitting companies
        from India, New Zealand and Uruguay wanting to reach the same markets.
        However, the usage of high quality raw materials and exhaustive quality
        controls methods may have helped Hands to finally access those markets.
       Additional working capital to expand internationally and to develop new
        distribution channels may have been difficult to find. This may have been
        solved through government grants, or financial support from international
        institutions helping small businesses in developing countries.
       Entering into international markets implied that some workers were given
        managerial authority; these organizational changes may have caused concern
        over workers and may have led to de-motivation and/or conflict among them.
        However, craftswomen’s loyalty to Hands may have helped to cope with these
        challenges.
       Exchange rate fluctuations between the Argentine Peso and the Euro and the
        US$, may affect sales and profitability.
       Hands may have faced problems when contacting important clients overseas
        and when bridging cultural and language barriers. Agents in the target
        countries where Hands was willing to export may have been contacted for this
        purpose.
       Hands may have faced additional innovation costs to introduce new knitting
        techniques and designs. It is possible that Hands may have contacted national
        and international designers to develop new products to meet the needs of top
        fashion markets.
       Hands may have adapted its scale of production to an increasing demand so as
        to be able to meet orders in the time and quality required. This may have been
        solved by hiring specialist or external consultants that may have helped Hands
        to adapt to its new position.

(d)   Evaluate the effectiveness of the democratic leadership style of the partners
      at Hands.                                                                     [7 marks]

      In a democratic leadership style workers are involved in the decision-making
      processes of the business; that is, consultation and collaboration are considered
      central elements.
       The collaborative environment created by a democratic leadership style could
         have resulted in better solutions to the challenges that the business had to face
         over the years, such as lack of finance and economic recessions.
       A democratic leadership style could have also enabled the sense of belonging
         and loyalty of craftswomen and thus increase motivation among them.
       A democratic leadership style probably enabled the sharing of ideas, designs,
         and knitting techniques which could have led to the success of Hands’ products
         in international markets.

      On the other hand:
       A democratic leadership style could have negatively affected the efficiency of
        the business by slowing down the decision-making processes. As the business
        employs around 300 craftswomen, coordination and cooperation although
        valuable, may have been chaotic, time consuming and therefore costly.
        Reaching a consensus over decisions may have been difficult.
       It is highly probable that most craftswomen belonging to Hands lacked
        managerial skills. For urgent decisions in challenging times, the democratic
        leadership style may have been inappropriate.

      Hand’s survival over the years and its current success seem to show that the
      application of a democratic leadership style was effective. Such success is clearly
      crystallized in the achievement of Hand’s challenges in entering into the world’s
      most demanding markets despite fierce competition.

           maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain two ways PF practices corporate social responsibility.                         [6 marks]

           PF practices corporate social responsibility when, beginning in 2007,
           it introduced organic cotton T-shirts to its brand line. The cotton in these shirts
           meets rigorous organic certification standards and the T-shirts are made without
           the use of environmentally harmful chemicals. This shift to environmentally
           friendly products is one form of corporate social responsibility.

           Another is the fact that these products are cut and sewn in manufacturing facilities
           committed to socially responsible practices. Presumably PF could have the
           manufacturing done in factories in developing nations, where workers are often
           poorly paid and overworked but which, nevertheless, can produce the product for
           less than those factories that practice social responsibility towards its employees.

           A final way that PF practices corporate social responsibility is the fact that the
           company makes donations to several organizations committed to environmental
           protection. Although doing so strengthens PF’s brand identity, it could strengthen
           its identity by other means, which does not include charitable contributions.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

(c)   Analyse the benefits of two methods of distribution of PF’s products.                [5 marks]

      The stimulus identifies three forms of distribution:
      1. the Internet (e-commerce)
      2. retail stores
      3. mobile retail stores –vans.

      The benefits of using the Internet is that it is inexpensive, provides worldwide
      access, and can be easily adapted as new products are introduced and old ones
      phased out. PF’s customer base is young people, who are not intimidated by the
      Internet and who, ever more frequently, have Internet access via their mobile
      phones. A major part of PF’s marketing strategy is to project a hip, somewhat
      Bohemian image, which PF can manage via its web site.

      Retail stores have certain benefits that the web page does not. Like the web page,
      retail stores can through décor and people shape an image that strengthens the PF
      brand. Unlike the web, sales representatives can develop a rapport with customers
      that can enhance sales. Also, customers can touch, feel, and try on the products.
      A drawback to retail stores is that they are expensive – rent,
      decorations/furnishings, and salaries and wages.

      The mobile retail concept allows PF to target events and venues where young
      people go with fewer expenses than a fixed retail store. With the mobile retail
      stores, buyers can touch and feel the products. Vans can be on location for the
      duration of the time young people are there – in the summer for theme parks, for
      one night in the event of concerts – but the company does not have to support a
      store during times when young people are not there.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      To achieve more than [3 marks] the benefits of two methods of distribution need
      to be analysed.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

     (d)   Discuss the importance and role of branding for PF.                                    [7 marks]

           Branding is crucially important to PF – except for its products made from organic
           cloth (and there are many labels made only from organic cloth) the only thing
           separating its products from many other vendors is the concept and look of the
           frog and the peace sign. PF has carefully crafted an image of products for the
           socially aware, environmentally conscious young person committed to peace. As
           long as the constellation of values is associated with the brand, PF can add
           products and lines as other products, such as the flag shorts, go into decline.

           In a general sense, branding provides many benefits to a company: branding can
           help create loyal customers, differentiate the product (even if only a perception of
           difference), and can give the company pricing flexibility – loyal customers will
           pay more to have the brand. Presumably, PF enjoys all of these benefits.

           One element of branding that is crucially important is the image of the
           “peace frog”. It helps potential customers and potential return customers quickly
           identify the maker of the product when they see someone wearing a PF product.

           There is a negative side to a strong brand identity. If one of its products has
           problems, the problem product can affect the entire brand. In addition,
           PF appeals to a certain type of person – someone who is environmentally aware,
           “politically correct,” and perhaps a bit Bohemian or “hippy”. As the brand
           identity strengthens, PF might not attract potential customers who do not identify
           with this image.

           Accept any other relevant discussion.


           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4. If no negative
           aspects of branding are addressed, award a maximum of [4 marks].

5.   (a)   Define the term product life cycle.                                                    [2 marks]

           Any product introduced to a market typically goes through six sequential stages:
           development, introduction, growth, maturity, saturation, and decline. The term
           product life cycle refers to the full cycle of the different stages in the life of a
           product and the anticipated sales volume at each stage.


           N.B. Not all sources list six stages to the product life cycle. Some list only five
           and do not have saturation. A good definition for full marks does not have to
           include saturation.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and

(b)   Calculate:

             Stock turnover is calculated with the formula:

               Average stock
                                 365  stock turnover in days

      (ii)   the 2011 stock turnover in days for typewriters.                            [2 marks]

             The stock turnover for typewriters can be calculated with the information
             given:

                43000
                          365  327  326.98 to 2 d.p  days
             40% 120000

(c)   Explain how the slow turnover of typewriters contributes to the liquidity
      problem of MOS.                                                           [3 marks]

      On average, stock at MOS turns over rather quickly. For all products it turns over
      in 37 days. One product segment where that is not the case is typewriters, which
      make up only a small percentage of MOS’ sales (3 % in 2009 and 1 % in 2011).
      Typewriters turnover in 327 days, which means that MOS has funds invested in
      typewriters that sit on the shelves a long time before selling. Thus, despite the
      fact that the gross profit margin on typewriters (60 %) is better than average
      (50 %), the company has considerable funds tied up in stock, weakening the
      company’s liquidity position. If MOS could reduce its stock inventory on
      typewriters to 30 days, the company’s average inventory balance would be
      $39 000 lower, freeing up those funds for other uses.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

      A general or limited response.

      [2 marks]
      The candidate’s response indicates some understanding that increases in stock
      turnover increases funds tied up in stock, thus worsening liquidity, and that a
      decrease in stock turnover reduces the amount of funds invested in stock, thus
      freeing up funds for other uses.

      [3 marks]
      The candidate’s response indicates a clear understanding that increases in stock
      turnover increases funds tied up in stock, thus worsening liquidity, and that a
      decrease in stock turnover reduces the amount of funds invested in stock, thus
      freeing up funds for other uses. The candidate supports these assertions with
      specific references to stock amounts and turnover periods.

(d)   Analyse MOS’ product portfolio by applying the Boston Consulting Group
      (BCG) matrix.                                                          [5 marks]
      The BCG matrix provides some insight into the product mix at MOS. Of the four
      categories of products (star, cash cow, problem child, and dog), two of MOS’
      products are clearly identifiable:

      Personal computers (PCs) are cash cows: MOS sells many PCs, and PC sales are
      declining slightly (suggesting saturation of the market). In general, in developed
      countries or markets such as Santiago, PC sales reached the top of the product life
      cycle in the first decade of the twenty first century. Then, sales shifted to
      replacement rate. If MOS wants to continue to grow, it will have to find new
      products.

      Typewriters are MOS’ dog: the company sells very few typewriters, and the
      market is contracting. While MOS probably has a specialty market segment at
      this point in typewriters – they are probably very hard to find in Santiago – the
      company should question whether to continue to offer them: they take up a lot of
      MOS’ stock for very few sales.

      The other two products MOS sells modern mobile telephones and portable DVD
      players are harder to categorize. Modern mobile telephones are probably a
      “problem child” for the company. They are one of the most rapidly changing
      technologies today, and they represent an enormous growth potential for MOS.
      However, modern mobile telephones make up only a small percentage of MOS’
      sales. This problem with sales may stem from image problems: known as an
      office machine company, MOS may not attract many young customers, or those
      seeking only modern mobile telephones. In this instance, the idea to change the
      name and image of the company would make sense. That way, MOS could start
      to sell more modern mobile telephones.

      Portable DVD players are also difficult to place. While MOS did experience solid
      sales growth with them from 2010 to 2011, the technology may soon be eclipsed
      by video streaming to devices such as personal computers, tablets (such as
      Apple iPads), and even modern mobile telephones. Thus, despite the solid sales, it
      may be too much to categorize them as stars and may be best to suggest that they
      are soon to be cash cows: products at the top of the product life cycle.

      Accept any other relevant application and analysis.

      If a candidate correctly draws the BCG matrix and places MOS’ products in it,
      identifying PCs as “cash cows” and typewriters as “dogs”, but otherwise does not
      have a written analysis, award [1 mark]. If the candidate does not refer to the
      BCG matrix at all, award [0 marks].

                                              – 22 –         M12/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(e)   Discuss Maria’s plans to stop selling typewriters and to change the name
      of MOS.                                                                  [7 marks]

      Maria’s plans for the business are driven by need (the liquidity problem) and by
      her desire to update the image of the company. By eliminating typewriters from
      the product line, she will be able to invest those funds currently invested in
      typewriters into items such as modern mobile telephones, portable DVD players,
      and personal computers, that turnover faster. She will also be able to give the
      business a fresher, newer look as typewriters, which are rarely used and have an
      outdated feel about them, will be removed from the shelves. These changes,
      coupled with the name change and, presumably, a new logo and business look,
      will give MOS a more modern feel. These kinds of changes can invigorate a
      business by attracting new customers and getting existing customers to consider
      new types of products and services.

      Her father, however, has reason to be concerned. One of the strengths of the
      business is its long-standing ties with the Santiago business community. Some of
      those loyal customers still use typewriters. If MOS no longer supplies them, these
      customers might start going to other office supply stores, giving MOS’
      competition an opportunity to establish relationships with some of MOS’ oldest
      customers. At the least, these customers will feel slighted and feel that their
      business is less meaningful to MOS than previously. Moreover, these changes to
      the business may not immediately resolve the liquidity problem. Just to move out
      the typewriters, MOS may have to sell them at deep discounts, lowering their
      current above-average profitability. Changing the name and signs (and probably
      the logo) will be expensive, and there will be some disruption in the business
      community, unless MOS introduces the changes with an extensive marketing
      campaign, which will also involve expenses.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.
