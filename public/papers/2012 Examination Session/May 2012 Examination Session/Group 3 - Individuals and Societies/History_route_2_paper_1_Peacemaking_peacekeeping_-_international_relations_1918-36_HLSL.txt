SOURCE A                Extract from a speech by President Woodrow Wilson in Omaha, Nebraska, USA, 8
                        September 1919.

For the first time in history the advisers of mankind are to be drawn together and concerted all over
the world … Germany is for the time being left out because we did not think that Germany was ready
to come in. She says that she made a mistake. We now want her to prove it by not making the same
mistake again … When an individual has committed a criminal act, the punishment is hard, but the
punishment is not unjust … Every great fighting nation in the world is on the list of those who are to
constitute the League of Nations. I say every great nation, because America is going to be included
among them, and the only choice my fellow citizens is whether we will go in now or come in later
with Germany; whether we will go in as founders of this covenant of freedom or go in as those who are
admitted after they have made a mistake and regretted it.

SOURCE C                Extract from Reconstituting the League of Nations, by Julia E. Johnsen, published
                        by the H. W. Wilson Company, New York, 1943.

The League was not allowed to become the great agency hoped for by President Wilson to correct the
undesirable conditions that inevitably crept into the Versailles Treaty and other post-war treaties …
Nearly every assessment of the League of Nations made in the past twenty years points out that the first
and principal difficulty was the failure to achieve a universal or near-universal membership. This fateful
decision of the United States, which deprived the League from the beginning of a very great moral and
material influence, was accompanied by an equally fatal decision in Paris in 1919 which kept Germany and
the Soviet Union out of League membership until 1926 and 1934 respectively. The psychological effects
of these decisions doubtless went very far in poisoning the atmosphere in which the infant League was
intended to grow and prosper.

Membership alone, of course, was not enough. To be effective it had to be coupled with wholehearted
cooperation. But failure to agree on major political questions, like disarmament and security, together with
the League’s condemnation of specific acts of aggression, led to the successive withdrawal of Germany,
Japan and Italy from the League. Later still, the Soviet Union was expelled for her aggression on Finland.


SOURCE D                Extract from a speech given by German journalist Wolfgang Schwarz at the Royal
                        Institute of International Affairs, London, 11 February 1931. See http://www.jstor.
                        org/discover/10.2307/3015982?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=
                        4&sid=56172205083

Germany applied at Versailles to be admitted as a member of the League, and as you all know, membership
was refused. It was said that the time had not yet come to admit Germany into the community of nations.
The movement for the League and the new world founded on the League was killed in Germany by the
attitude of the Powers. After such a refusal Germany felt that the League was only a second War Council
or Ambassador’s Conference, that it was nothing but an instrument to maintain the peace treaties. Rightly
or wrongly she felt that all the decisions were made to keep her down and to prolong war policy into peace.


SOURCE E                Extract from Patrick O. Cohrs (2008) The Unfinished Peace after World War I:
                        America, Britain and the Stabilisation of Europe 1919–32, Cambridge University
                        Press, Cambridge.

It has been claimed that if America had joined the League the German problem could have been solved
even without stabilizing Germany as a Republic – by automatically involving Washington in the
“European balance of power” and thus containing the German ambitions. In all likelihood, as French
anxieties at Versailles underlined, even with British and American support the League would have been too
feeble and inflexible an institution to serve its central purpose: to ensure security for a Europe devastated
by war. It would have required an extensive test period – to prove that its principal powers were willing
to enforce its covenant – before gaining legitimacy. The League’s key members had to pave the way for
Germany’s admission and ensure the institution’s workability thereafter. As it came into being, the League
could not be the post-war’s key instrument of security.
