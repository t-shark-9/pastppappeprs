                                               The Silkworms

                            All their lives in a box! What generations,
                            What centuries of masters, not meaning to be cruel
                            But needing their labour, taught these creatures such patience
                            That now though sunlight strikes on the eye’s dark jewel
                        5   Or moonlight breathes on the wing they do not stir
                            But like the ghosts of moths crouch silent there.

                            Look, it’s a child’s toy! There is no lid even,
                            They can climb, they can fly, and all the world’s their tree;
                            But hush, they say in themselves, we are in prison.
                       10   There is no word to tell them that they are free,
                            And they are not; ancestral voices bind them
                            In dream too deep for wind or word to find them.

                            Even in the young, each like a little dragon
                            Ramping and green upon his mulberry leaf,
                       15   So full of life, it seems, the voice has spoken:
                            They hide where there is food, where they are safe,
                            And the voice whispers, “Spin the cocoon,
                            Sleep, sleep, you shall be wrapped in me soon.”

                            Now is their hour, when they wake from that long swoon;
                       20   Their pale curved wings are marked in a pattern of leaves,
                            Shadowy for trees, white for the dance of the moon;
                            And when on summer nights the buddleia gives
                            Its nectar like lilac wine for insects mating
                            They drink its fragrance and shiver, impatient with waiting,

                       25   They stir, they think they will go. Then they remember
                            It was forbidden, forbidden, ever to go out;
                            The Hands are on guard outside like claps of thunder,
                            The ancestral voice says Don’t, and they do not.
                            Still the night calls them to unimaginable bliss
                       30   But there is terror around them, the vast, the abyss,

                            And here is the tribe that they know, in their known place,
                            They are gentle and kind together, they are safe for ever,
                            And all shall be answered at last when they embrace.
                            White moth moves closer to moth, lover to lover.
                       35   There is that pang of joy on the edge of dying—
                            Their soft wings whirr, they dream that they are flying.
