Answer one question. Refer closely to the novel you have selected to study, a clean copy of which may be
brought into the examination.

1.    Novels often include funny episodes. Choosing one comic passage from the novel you have studied
      show how you would present this passage to entertain an audience.


2.    Novels often devote passages to the development of one character. Through focusing on one passage
      of this kind show how such a focus could be made fascinating for an audience.


3.    Choose one passage from the novel you have studied that might be considered climactic. Show how
      you would stage this passage to convey the excitement of the original to the audience.
