General notes:
• The following paragraphs are to be considered suggestions, rather than prescriptions, i.e. all points
  made by candidates to be marked on their merits.
• Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
• The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: e.g. double mention of alliteration.

     (e)   this is the Leitmotiv of Horace’s poetry: a quiet unassuming way of life, opposed to a busy
           style [1 mark]; the extract reflects therefore a composition based on contrasts, e.g.: the man
           who only believes in what he can acquire, forgetful of gods, as opposed to the traditional way
           of life that of the farmer: impia cervice versus agrestium virorum [1 mark]; consequently
           there is the contrast between artificial products versus nature: dulcem elaboratum saporem
           versus umbrosam ripam [1 mark]; in the final stanza of this extract, through two rhetorical
           questions Horace reaffirms his choice: that of a simple life as opposed to what he ultimately
           considers to be ostentatious: why to build a fancy style house [1 marks] and why to change
           his Sabine landscape with riches producing only too much hassle [1 mark].

           wanted to add to the miraculous of his story / to leave a testimony about an unusual fact /other
           explanations on their merits [1 mark].
                                                                                                 [15 marks]

           [1 mark]; as the theme of Satire 3 is “Rome is no more a place for Romans”, it is appropriate
           to show how this feeling dominates Umbricius’ mind [1 mark]; also, there is a strong contrast
           between the poor aspect of a decent man and the elegance of these nouveaux riches, as the

            words clientes and servis are placed in the final position of their respective lines [1 mark];
            cogimur is in enjambment for emphasis [1 mark]; cultis is used ironically [1 mark];
