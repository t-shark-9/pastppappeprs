General notes:
• The following are to be considered suggestions rather than prescriptions, i.e. all points made by
  candidates to be marked on their merits.
• Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
• The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: e.g. double mention of alliteration.


Elegiac and Lyric poetry

           Otherwise, no mark should be awarded.

     (b)   any two of: he will accept the change and wrap himself in his virtue [1 mark]; this is a
           humorous allusion to a common place in Greek philosophy, whereas virtue is described as a
           cloak [1 mark]; poverty is a virtue, not a vice [1 mark]; he will ask for her hand in marriage
           without a dowry [1 mark].

     (c)   well-known trade places [1 mark]. [1 mark] for any of: Cyprus was famous for copper, and

     (d)   Life is similar to a sea-voyage [1 mark]; it can be stormy [1 mark], but unlike businessmen
           the poet does not want to seek the Gods’ pity [1 mark]; he will happily take a little
           boat/bireme to reach safety [1 mark]; that means he will abandon his previous comfort,
           which is what he already hinted at in the poem (see, supra, answer for (b)).
                                                                                            [10 marks]

     (c)   mockery or humorous quotations, like “hinsidias” or “chommoda” [1 mark]; comic use of the
           adverb “mirifice” with the verb “locutum” [1 mark]; dramatic irony (Arrius is unaware of the
           effect): “sperabat” [1 mark]; the force of “sperabat” here: “flattered himself” (Fordyce) [1
           mark]; Catullus’ ironic supposition that Arrius’ ancestors may have indeed spoken like that:
           “sic mater etc” [1 mark]; the comic exaggeration about the Ionic sea becoming “Hionic”
           [1 mark]. Award one mark for any appropriate remark and one for any pertinent example.
                                                                                             [12 marks]
