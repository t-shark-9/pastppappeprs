Answer all the questions.

1.    A tourist board has provided an interactive website that describes the 30 most popular
      towns in the country.  The website also allows the user to plan journeys from any of
      these towns.

      To calculate distances between towns, the website uses data that is stored in a
      two-dimensional integer array called  distances, which is declared as a global
      variable.  Part of the array is shown below.

                                 distances
                                       0     1     2      3

                                 0     0    18    25    30

                                 1    18     0    54    32

                                 2    25    54     0    34

                                 3    30    32    34      0




      For example: the distance between town 2 and town 3 (distances[2][3]) is 34 km.

      The website also makes use of the method  getTownName(int j), which returns the
      name of the town with index  j.

      (a)   State the value of  distances[0][2].                                                   [1 mark]

      The website includes a method called  circle(), which displays the names of all of the
      towns that are closer than a specified distance from the town where the user is staying.

      (b)   Construct the method  circle(int i, int d), where  i  is the index of the
            town where the user is staying and  d  is the distance from the town.                  [4 marks]




                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      The website uses a second method called  threeTowns(), that allows the user
      to plan a day’s journey in which they will visit two other towns before finally
      returning to the town in which they are staying (the journey can be represented by
      Town A  Town B  Town C  Town A, where A is the town in which the user
      is staying).

      This method will search the  distances  array to find and display the two towns that
      will provide the shortest total distance.

      (c)   (i)    Use the array to calculate the total distance for a journey starting at
                   town 2, and then visiting town 0 and town 3, before finally returning to
                   town 2 (Town 2  Town 0  Town 3  Town 2).                                   [1 mark]

            (ii)   Construct the method  threeTowns(int s), where  s  is the index of the
                   town in which the user is staying.                                           [8 marks]

      (d)   Suggest how the method  getTownName() functions.                                    [2 marks]

      (e)   Explain the modifications to  circle(), that would have to be made if the results
            had to be returned to the calling method.                                           [4 marks]

2.    A hash table is used to return the Spanish translation of an English word.  The table
      uses a simple hash function in which the alphabetical position of the first letter of the
      English word (where a = position 0, b = position 1, etc.) becomes the hash value.

      For example: the initial letter of the word antelope is “a”, therefore the hash value
      will be 0.

      This value will then point to the object in the hash table that contains the original
      English word with its Spanish equivalent.

      (a)   (i)    Using this function, copy and complete the following hash table (the first
                   three entries have been completed for you).                                    [1 mark]

                        English Word          Array Index           Hash Table
                          antelope                 0             antelope, antilope
                            brain                  1               brain, cerebro
                          elephant                 4             elephant, elefante
                             fox                                     fox, zorro
                            door                                    door, puerta

            (ii)   Explain why collisions will be inevitable if this hash table is used for a
                   large number of words.                                                         [2 marks]

      To deal with the possibility of collisions, the hash table is changed so that each hash
      value points to a linked list of objects.  As a pair of words (English, Spanish) is added
      to the table, they are placed at the head of the appropriate list, as shown below.

        English Word     Array Index             Hash Table (array of linked lists)
          antelope            0          antelope, antilope  null
           camel              2          camel, camelo  null
             car              2          car, coche  camel, camelo  null
             ant              0          ant, hormiga  antelope, antilope  null




      (b)   Copy the above hash table and complete the two missing entries using the
            following data (English, Spanish): cat, gato; arm, brazo.                             [1 mark]




                                                            (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      A program has been written to simulate this hash table using the hash function
      described at the start of this question.  The hash value can be found using the following
      method call:

                                int hashValue = hash(englishWord);

      The class that maintains the hash table with its array of linked lists is called  HashTable.  
      Each object in the linked lists is a member of the  Node   class.   Both classes are
      defined below.

      public class HashTable
      {
        private Node[] listHeads = new Node[26];                       // array of head pointers

            private int hash(String englishWord)
            {
              // returns the hash position (array index)
              // for the English word that is input
            }

            class Node // inner class for the hash table objects
            {
              String englishWord;
              String spanishWord;
              Node next;

                public Node(String e, String s)               // constructor
                {
                  englishWord = e;
                  spanishWord = s;
                  next = null;
                }
            }

            public void add()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }

            public void search()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
      }

      (c)       Construct the code for the method  add(), that adds a new English word and its
                Spanish equivalent to the hash table.                                                  [6 marks]

      (d)       Construct the method  search(), that outputs the Spanish equivalent of a given
                English word.  You can assume that the word is in the table.                           [5 marks]

      (e)       (i)    Discuss the suitablity of using this hash function for this application.        [3 marks]

                (ii)   Explain one improvement that could be made to this hashing process.             [2 marks]

3.    A large supermarket holds in secondary memory all the records relating to the items
      it sells.  At the beginning of each working day, a small part of each record of this file
      is read into a dynamic data structure in the primary memory (RAM).  This dynamic
      data structure is accessed by the supermarket checkout terminals whenever a customer
      purchases goods.

      (a)   Suggest two reasons why part of this file might be read into a dynamic
            data structure.                                                                         [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain why a binary tree might be preferred to a linked list as the dynamic data
            structure to be used.                                                                   [2 marks]

      (c)   The dynamic data structure is used to update stock levels in the main file.

            (i)    Identify two fields that would definitely be held in each node in the
                   dynamic data structure.                                                          [2 marks]

            (ii)   Outline the steps taken to update the stock file after one particular item has
                   been sold at the supermarket checkout.                                           [6 marks]

      (d)   Outline one way in which stock items can be identified as needing to be reordered.      [3 marks]

      A separate program prints out a list of all the items on sale in the supermarket in
      alphabetical order.

      (e)   Explain how a dynamic data structure can be used to produce this list even
            though the items are not stored in alphabetical order in the secondary memory.          [3 marks]

4.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   Suggest two principal reasons that have led to the convergence of technologies
            as shown on page 3 of the case study.                                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two reasons why flash memory is used extensively by mobile devices.           [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain why Wi-Fi has been chosen as the communication technology for
            Internet hotspots as opposed to other technologies.                                   [4 marks]

      (d)   Discuss whether the lack of dominance of one operating system for mobile
            devices might improve the security of data in smartphones in comparison with
            personal computers.                                                                   [4 marks]

      (e)   Two students are sitting in a café.  They both have smartphones which have their
            Bluetooth facility enabled.

            (i)    Describe the precautions they should take while sending files to each other.   [4 marks]

            (ii)   State two different examples of a piconet that might be operating within
                   this café.                                                                     [2 marks]

            (iii) Outline how  frequency-hopping prevents the piconets from interfering
                  with each other.                                                                [4 marks]

      (f)   With reference to one specific example, discuss whether the possible
            disadvantages of the use of smartphones by doctors for their work outweigh
            the advantages.                                                                       [6 marks]

      Police forces in several countries are being equipped with smartphones.

      (g)   (i)    Describe two ways in which smartphones could aid police who have just
                   stopped a motorist suspected of a crime.                                       [4 marks]

            (ii)   Suggest one way in which the use of Bluetooth could provide additional
                   assistance.                                                                    [2 marks]

      (h)   With reference to mobile phone networks, explain how two different mobile
            phones are able to use the same frequency within the same city at the same time.      [4 marks]
