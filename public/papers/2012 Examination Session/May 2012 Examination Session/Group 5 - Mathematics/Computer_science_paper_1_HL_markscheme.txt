General Marking Instructions

After marking a sufficient number of scripts to become familiar with the markscheme and
candidates’ responses to all or the majority of questions, Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be
contacted by their Team Leader (TL). The purpose of this contact is to discuss the standard
of marking, the interpretation of the markscheme and any difficulties with particular questions.
It may be necessary to review your initial marking after contacting your TL. DO NOT BEGIN
THE FINAL MARKING OF YOUR SCRIPTS IN RED INK UNTIL YOU RECEIVE
NOTIFICATION THAT THE MARKSCHEME IS FINALIZED. You will be informed by
e-mail, fax or post of modifications to the markscheme and should receive these about one week
after the date of the examination. If you have not received them within 10 days you should
contact your TL and IB Cardiff. Make an allowance for any difference in time zone
before calling. AEs WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY
NOT BE INVITED TO MARK IN FUTURE SESSIONS.


You should contact the TL whose name appears on your “Allocation of Schools listing” sheet.


Note:
Please use a personal courier service when sending sample materials to TLs unless postal services can be
guaranteed. Record the costs on your examiner claim form.

General Marking Instructions
1.    Once markscheme is received mark in pencil until final markscheme is received.

2.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. Indeed,
      another examiner may have arrived at the opposite decision. In these cases write a brief annotation
      in the left-hand margin to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking.

5.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

6.    Record subtotals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer. Show a mark for each part question (a), (b), etc. Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total
      mark for the question in the right-hand margin opposite the last line of the answer.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin.

8.    Section A: Add together the total for the section and write it in the Examiner Column on the cover
                 sheet.
      Section B: Record the mark awarded for each of the six questions answered in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.
      Total:     Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.

9.    After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition of all marks to ensure that you have
      not made an arithmetical error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the
      cover sheet. We have script checking and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback
      to all examiners.

10.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.

11.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Once again
      make a comment to this effect in the left-hand margin.

Mark Allocation

Section A:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
Section B:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 60 marks.
              Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

      the interviewee;
            This can result in contradictory or inconsistent data;

      People are often biased/untruthful in interviews;
           This can produce incorrect data that can mislead the design team;

Question 15 continued

      (d)   Changes to  are:
            New method signature:   ;
            Return values  /  instead of  / and recursive call on ;                  [2 marks]

      (e)   Award [1 mark] for an advantage and [1 mark] for a disadvantage, up to
            [2 marks max].

            Possible advantages:
            More elegant way to express the solution, for some problems;
            Recursive algorithms reflect mathematical/structural definitions;
            Recursive programs have shorter code;

            Possible disadvantages
            A recursive method needs more memory than its iterative counterpart;
            Time performance may be worse (because it freezes recursive calls);
            Debugging a recursive code can be tricky, so maintenance is difficult;             [2 marks]

                                                                                        Total: [10 marks]


16.   (a)   Because CPU would periodically check all sensors in the network;
            CPU time is wasted if there is no need of action, and it could be assigned to
            other processes;                                                                   [2 marks]

      (b)   Award marks along these guidelines up to [3 marks max].
            Interrupt signal is sent to computer;
            CPU activates the event handler and suspends/puts on stack current tasks;
            CPU services the tasks related to the request of interrupt;
            When these finish, CPU resumes suspended tasks/pops them from stack;               [3 marks]

      (c)   Award up to [1 mark max]. Possible answers:
            Sending an interrupt signal to the computer;
            Comparing the sensed values with the admitted values’ range;                        [1 mark]


                                                                                             continued …

Question 16 continued

      (d)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
            Award [1 mark] for inferring information from the interrupt;
            Award [1 mark] for activating/releasing actuators;
            Award [1 mark] for a program that depends on current values;
            Award [1 mark] for polling (or similar mechanism) for a feedback;
            Award [1 mark] for both activate and deactivate actuators (resource handling);

            Loop:
            It identifies (through the interrupt) where/which anomalous value occurs;
            It consequently decides which actuators to activate and executes the program
            to progressively modify values depending on the current values;
            It polls the same sensor(s) for a new reading and a new interrupt may
            be generated;

            Exit Loop:
            The polled sensors do not reply with an interrupt;
            The server deactivates/releases/puts in stand-by the actuators;                        [4 marks]

                                                                                            Total: [10 marks]


17.   (a)   The length for each data type, for each field, is fixed (for both primitive/
            reference types);                                                                       [1 mark]

      (b)   Primitive type  has already fixed length;
            Assign to each  field a fixed number of bytes;
            By adding extra spaces if necessary;                                                   [3 marks]

      (c)   Records not frequently accessed implies slow disk access is still acceptable;
            Fixed length makes the retrieval of desired records easy;
            Records do not need to be ordered on disk;                                             [3 marks]

      (d)   Award up to [3 marks max].
            Answers may have a varying level of detail.
            Award marks that highlight the following structure:

            Solution Indexed file
            Create an index (e.g. full);
            Each record is associated to a unique value in the index;
            The index can be searched sequentially and the record retrieved directly;

            Solution Hashing
            Define a hashing function based on string keys (to minimise collisions);
            That returns the address of the record to be used in a hash map/array;
            And have a mechanism for handling collisions;                                          [3 marks]

                                                                                            Total: [10 marks]

18.   (a)   In-order traversal (left-root-right);                                                         [1 mark]

      (b)   Silvia is the left child of the sub-tree rooted Wei;                                          [1 mark]

      (c)   Award up to [4 marks max].
            Because the tree is unbalanced / was created by inserting only one node at
            a time;
            Searching for a node/insertion point may require traversing the whole tree;
            e.g. searching for Wei / inserting a node that is right child of Wei / the worst
            case is a right descending tree;
            Hence, BigO efficiency of searching is linear/O(n), where n is the number of nodes;          [4 marks]

      (d)   Award up to [4 marks max].
            Several answers, more or less formal, are possible.                     They may be
            simplifications of the following examples:

            Example answer 1: simple deletion, maintains the tree unbalanced
            Find the node Marion;
            Look in its left sub-tree to find the maximum (Lou) / find the maximum of
            Marion’s minorants;
            This node replaces Marion;
            If it was not a leaf (i.e. it is the root of a left sub-tree), its sub-tree will be lifted
            up one level;

            Example answer 2: deletion aiming in balancing the tree
            Find the node Marion;
            Look in its right sub-tree to find the minimum (Neil) / find the minimum of
            Marion’s majorants;
            This node replaces Marion;
            If it was not a leaf (i.e. it is the root of a right sub-tree), its sub-tree can be
            lifted up one level;

            Award [2 marks] for the correct drawing of the resulting tree alone.

            Do not give full marks if it is not evident that the result of deleting a node is
            indeed a structurally valid tree.                                                            [4 marks]

19.   (a)   Award marks as follows up to [5 marks max].
            Award [1 mark] for showing the mainframe;
            Award [1 mark] for correct use of switch and possible gateways (to connect
            LAN to WAN);
            Award [1 mark] for showing the servers at regional centres;
            Award [1 mark] for correctly depicting the elements of the LANs;
            Award [1 mark] for clearly labelling the elements;

            Several answers are possible: here it is depicted as a star-of-bus.
            Bus-of-stars (Bus as backbone), star-of-stars (with several switches) and
            ring-star are viable alternatives.



                                                            Switch
                                                            Server at regional centre
                                                            Terminal/operator
                                                            Mainframe


                                                                                          [5 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Optical cable, general telecom lines;                                   [1 mark]

            (ii)   Twisted pair, coaxial cable;
                   Accept “air” and “Ethernet cable” but do NOT accept “Ethernet”
                   without the “cable” modifier.                                           [1 mark]

      (c)   Because a switch inspects the data packet received (destination);
            It forwards the packet to the appropriate server only;
            Hence the performances of the network are better than with a hub that would
            broadcast;                                                                    [3 marks]
