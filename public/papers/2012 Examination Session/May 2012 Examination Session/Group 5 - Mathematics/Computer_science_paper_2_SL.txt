Answer all the questions.

1.    Consider the following code.

      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        int distance = 600;
        String town = "Mexico";
        String newTown = changes(distance, town);
        output distance;
        output newTown;
      }

      private static String changes(int distance, String town)
      {
        distance = distance + 100;
        String t = " City";
        town = town + t;
        output distance;
        return town;
      }

      (a)   (i)    Define, using an example from the above code, the scope of a variable.          [2 marks]

            (ii)   With reference to the above code, outline the significance of the identifier
                   private.                                                                        [2 marks]

            (iii) State the output from the above code.                                            [3 marks]

      The string function  length() returns the number of elements in a string.  For example,
      word.length() will return the value  8, if  word   =   "computer".

      Similarly, the function  charAt(x) returns the character at position  x   in a string.  
      For example,  word.charAt(1) will return the character “o” and  word.charAt(3)
      will return “p”.

      (b)   Consider another section of code.

            String word = "school";
            int a = word.length();
            char b = word.charAt(0);

            (i)    State the value assigned to the variable  a.                                    [1 mark]

            (ii)   State the value assigned to the variable  b.                                    [1 mark]




                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      The method  analyse() has been written that counts the number of vowels in a set
      of words (the vowels can be considered to be the letters a, e, i, o and u).

      (c)   Describe the global variable  vowels  that holds the number of occurrences of
            each of the five vowels.                                                         [3 marks]

      The method  analyse  will be called by the statement  analyse(wordArray, size);,
      where  wordArray   is an array of words, and  size   is the number of words in
      this array.

      (d)   Construct the method  analyse() that will look for each vowel in every word
            in  wordArray, and amend  vowels  accordingly.  You can assume that all of the
            words are formed of lower case letters.                                          [8 marks]

2.    A small supermarket has computerized both its checkout (where the customers pay)
      and its inventory system (where the stock levels are kept).  Each item in the supermarket
      can be identified by means of a barcode.

      (a)     State two essential features of the barcodes that will enable them to function
              within this computerized system.                                                     [2 marks]

      Details of all of the supermarket’s products are stored on a sequential access file on the
      main server.  This file can be accessed from the checkout terminals.

      (b)     Identify two reasons for the checkout terminals being able to access this file.      [2 marks]

      The  Customer   class is called every time a new customer arrives at the checkout.  
      The  Item  class contains details of one particular supermarket item.  The two classes
      are partly shown below.

      public class Item // contains details of an item
      {
        String name;
        String barcode;
        double cost;
        String type; // e.g. fruit, cosmetics
      }

      public class Customer
      {
        public double totalCost;              // final cost

            public static void newCustomer()
            // runs the checkout process

            private static String readBarcode()
            // returns the barcode for a scanned item

            private Item getDetails(String barcode)
            // retrieves the details of one item from the database

            private static void printItem(Item i)
            // prints some details of the current item on the receipt

            private static void updateInventory(String barcode)
            // updates the inventory (stock levels) on the file
            // when an item is bought

            public static void main(String[] args)
            {
              new Customer();
            }
      }



                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      (c)   Assuming that there are no other classes in the program, state the first two   
            methods that would be run by the  Customer  class.                                  [2 marks]

      As the checkout process begins, the method  newCustomer() is called.  
      After the last item is scanned, the process is terminated by pressing an END key.  
      The  newCustomer() method includes the following series of steps:
      • an array of  Item  objects is created
      • repeat until END key is pressed
        * an item is scanned in and its barcode read
        * an  Item  object is initialized using data from the database
        * some of its details are printed on the receipt
      • after the END key is pressed
        * the inventory is updated for each item sold
        * the total cost is printed.

      (d)   Construct the method  newCustomer() which is started below.   You should
            make use of the other methods listed in the  Customer  class without writing
            their code.                                                                         [8 marks]

            public static void newCustomer()
            {
              Item[] goods = new Item[500];
              // the rest of the code is missing
            }

      (e)   Outline the steps (without writing code) that must take place whenever the
            method  updateInventory() is called.                                                [4 marks]

      (f)   Suggest an additional process that can be carried out as item records are updated
            on the file.                                                                        [2 marks]

3.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   Suggest two principal reasons that have led to the convergence of technologies
            as shown on page 3 of the case study.                                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two reasons why flash memory is used extensively by mobile devices.           [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain why Wi-Fi has been chosen as the communication technology for
            Internet hotspots as opposed to other technologies.                                   [4 marks]

      (d)   Discuss whether the lack of dominance of one operating system for mobile
            devices might improve the security of data in smartphones in comparison with
            personal computers.                                                                   [4 marks]

      (e)   Two students are sitting in a café.  They both have smartphones which have their
            Bluetooth facility enabled.

            (i)    Describe the precautions they should take while sending files to each other.   [4 marks]

            (ii)   State two different examples of a piconet that might be operating within
                   this café.                                                                     [2 marks]

            (iii) Outline how  frequency-hopping prevents the piconets from interfering
                  with each other.                                                                [4 marks]

      (f)   With reference to one specific example, discuss whether the possible
            disadvantages of the use of smartphones by doctors for their work outweigh
            the advantages.                                                                       [6 marks]
