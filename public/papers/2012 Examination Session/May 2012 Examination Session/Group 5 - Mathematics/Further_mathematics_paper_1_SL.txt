Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this
is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

      (a)   The set S1 = {2 , 4 , 6 , 8} and ×10 denotes multiplication modulo 10.

		          (i)    Write down the Cayley table for {S1 , ×10 }.

		          (ii)   Show that {S1 , ×10 } is a group.

		          (iii) Show that this group is cyclic.                                                 [8 marks]

      (b)   Now consider the group {S2 , ×20 } where S2 = {1, 9 , 11, 19} and ×20 denotes
            multiplication modulo 20. Giving a reason, state whether or not {S1 , ×10 } and
            {S2 , ×20 } are isomorphic.                                                           [3 marks]

      (a)   Express the number 47502 as a product of its prime factors.                           [2 marks]

      (b)   The positive integers M , N are such that gcd ( M , N ) = 63 and
            lcm ( M , N ) = 47502 . Given that M is even and M < N , find the two possible
            pairs of values for M , N .                                                           [5 marks]

      (a)   By evaluating successive derivatives at x = 0 , find the Maclaurin series for
            ln cos x up to and including the term in x 4 .                                        [8 marks]

		          (i)    the limit does not exist;

		          (ii)   the limit is zero;

		          (iii) the limit is finite and non-zero, giving its value in this case.                [5 marks]

      Bill buys two biased coins from a toy shop.

      (a)   The shopkeeper claims that when one of the coins is tossed, the probability of
            obtaining a head is 0.6. Bill wishes to test this claim by tossing the coin 250
            times and counting the number of heads obtained.

		          (i)    State suitable hypotheses for this test.

		          (ii)   He obtains 140 heads. Find the p-value of this result and determine whether
                   or not it supports the shopkeeper’s claim at the 5 % level of significance.     [6 marks]

      (b)   Bill tosses the other coin a large number of times and counts the number of
            heads obtained. He correctly calculates a 95 % confidence interval for the
            probability that when this coin is tossed, a head is obtained. This is calculated as
            [0.35199 , 0.44801] where the end-points are correct to five significant figures.
            Determine

		          (i)    the number of times the coin was tossed;

		          (ii)   the number of heads obtained.                                                   [7 marks]

6.    [Maximum mark: 9]

      (a)   Using mathematical induction or otherwise, prove that the number (1020) n ,
            that is the number 1020 written with base n , is divisible by 3 for all values of n
            greater than 2.                                                                       [8 marks]

      (b)   Explain briefly why the case n = 2 has to be excluded.                                [1 mark]
