General Marking Instructions

After marking a sufficient number of scripts to become familiar with the markscheme and
candidates’ responses to all or the majority of questions, Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be
contacted by their Team Leader (TL). The purpose of this contact is to discuss the standard
of marking, the interpretation of the markscheme and any difficulties with particular questions.
It may be necessary to review your initial marking after contacting your TL. DO NOT BEGIN
THE FINAL MARKING OF YOUR SCRIPTS IN RED INK UNTIL YOU RECEIVE
NOTIFICATION THAT THE MARKSCHEME IS FINALIZED. You will be informed by
e-mail, fax or post of modifications to the markscheme and should receive these about one week
after the date of the examination. If you have not received them within 10 days you should
contact your TL and IB Cardiff. Make an allowance for any difference in time zone before
calling. AEs WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY NOT BE
INVITED TO MARK IN FUTURE SESSIONS.


You should contact the TL whose name appears on your “Allocation of Schools listing” sheet.


Note:
Please use a personal courier service when sending sample materials to TLs unless postal services can
be guaranteed. Record the costs on your examiner claim form.

General Marking Instructions

1.    Once markscheme is received mark in pencil until final markscheme is received.


2.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.


3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.


4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. Indeed,
      another examiner may have arrived at the opposite decision. In these cases write a brief annotation
      in the left-hand margin to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking.


5.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.


6.    Record subtotals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer. Show a mark for each part question (a), (b), etc. Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total
      mark for the question in the right-hand margin opposite the last line of the answer.


7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin.


8.    Record the mark awarded for each of the four questions answered in the Examiner Column on the
      cover sheet. Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
      Column on the cover sheet.


9.    After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition of all marks to ensure that you have
      not made an arithmetical error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the
      cover sheet. We have script checking and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback
      to all examiners.


10.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.


11.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Once again
      make a comment to this effect in the left-hand margin.

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2,
[20 marks] for question 3 and [40 marks] for question 4. Maximum total = [100 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

      Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

                  hash table);                                                                 [3 marks]

           (ii)   A different hash function should be used;
                  Which increases the number of hash values (positions) which will reduce
                  the number of collisions and consequently the search time;                   [2 marks]

                  Only award full marks for parts (e)(i) and (ii) if the answers are both
                  clear and show good knowledge. Only allow answers that deal with the
                  actual hashing process.

           It can be searched faster than the main file (in secondary memory);
           Because it is in the memory (RAM/primary memory) / because the RAM is
           faster memory;

           Because it is a subset of the main data;
           It might just contain the data for each record needed for the customer receipt;

           It might point to the correct record in the main file;
           (Acting as a full index to allow retrieval of data);

           Dynamic so that only the required amount of memory is used;
           And expand (or contract) as necessary;

           Dynamic because the number of products sold changes over time;
           A fixed-size data structure might not be big enough;                                   [4 marks]

     (b)   A binary tree can be searched faster than a linked list / permits binary searching;

           (ii)   The item id code;
                  Would be used to search the data structure;
                  Once found the record address pointed to by the found node;
                  Would locate the correct record;
                  The stock level (field);
                  Would then be updated;                                                          [6 marks]

     (d)   As each item is purchased the quantity available is decreased;
           If this level is less than a preset value;
           The item is added to a reorder file / an order is automatically made;
           Or
           At the end of each day;
           The file is searched sequentially to check actual levels against preset levels;
           If necessary the item is added to a reorder file / an order is automatically made;     [3 marks]

     (e)   Award up to [3 marks max].
           As the items are read into a binary tree;
           They are compared to the root node;
           If alphabetically the item is less than the root node the left subtree is inspected,
           otherwise the right;
           The process is continued until an empty leaf node is found, and the item is
           placed there;
           An in-order traversal will then display all items in alphabetical order;
           Or
           As each item is read into a queue/linked list;
           It is placed into its correct alphabetical position;
           When this is completed the data is printed off in order;                               [3 marks]

     (b)   Less danger of damage when moving around;
           As flash memory has no moving parts;

           Low energy consumption;
           Prolongs battery life;

           Small (physical) size for size of memory;
           Reduces weight of device / lots of memory for its size;

           Fast processing;
           To permit multi-tasking etc.

           Can be used to supplement permanent memory (as cards);
           Which also allows files to be transferred physically / creates unlimited storage space;    [4 marks]

     (c)   Award up to [4 marks max].
           Can efficiently cover a suitably sized area (airport lounge, small building);
           As it does not require line of sight;
           Or cables / it’s wireless;
           High bandwidth is available now / high data transfer speed;
           And data travels at the speed of light (between devices);

           Most PCs run Windows operating systems;
           So it is profitable for writers of viruses to write for Windows;
           As different OS require reprogramming virus programs;
           And as there is no such dominance in the smartphone market;
           There are less viruses around for each OS;                                                 [4 marks]

(iii) Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
      Award [1 mark] for the idea that different frequencies can be used;
      Award [1 mark] for other devices could be using the same frequencies;
      Award [1 mark] for the two on the same piconet switch frequencies;
      Award [1 mark] for rapidly/often (to prevent/minimize interference);
      Only award maximum marks for a clear knowledgeable answer.
     A piconet can operate over a small frequency range, however, within this
     range there are many possible values. When two devices initially make
     contact they communicate on one of these values. They then (together)
     change this frequency many times per second to make it unlikely that
     another piconet will cause any significant interference.                     [4 marks]

Question 4 continued

     (f)   Award marks as follows up to [6 marks max].
           Award [2 marks] for a detailed description of the example/scenario;
           Award [2 marks] for sound technical knowledge;
           Award [2 marks] for discussing the advantages/disadvantages;

           One example of many:
           A doctor would be able to access a patient’s records from anywhere with Wi-Fi
           access, for example, from within a different hospital or the patient’s house or
           even the scene of an accident. This will provide the doctor with up-to-date
           medical information which might be vital.

           However, any Wi-Fi network has security issues with the possibility of third
           party interception of data, especially for unsecured networks where no key is
           needed. Interception of data could have negative consequences for the patient
           concerned, as it could lead to problems regarding employment, insurance or
           even to circumstances in which blackmail may occur if particular conditions
           become known.                                                                            [6 marks]

     (g)   (i)    Award up to [4 marks max].
                  Could access police database;
                  To check details of occupants or car;
                  Could download photo of suspect;
                  To check id;
                  Could download report;
                  To save time with paperwork / time in office;                                     [4 marks]

           (ii)   Many examples including:
                  Fingerprints could be taken by a (second) device equipped with Bluetooth;
                  Data is then transferred to smartphone then sent to headquarters;                 [2 marks]

     (h)   Award up to [4 marks max].
           Each area of the city is divided into cells;
           A certain subset of the possible frequencies can be used by each cell;
           But adjacent cells cannot use the same frequencies / but users in different cells can;
           Sender and receiver use different frequencies;
           Signal strength is limited so senders (or receivers) in different cells do not get
           interference;
           If user moves from one cell to another, his/her frequency is changed as
           appropriate;

           Only award maximum marks if the answer is clear and shows good technical
           knowledge.                                                               [4 marks]
