                           This edition can be fully distributed, duplicated, performed, and recorded.
                                                 The following adaptations were made:
            •   The names of the instruments at the start of the score. The original mentioned ‘Violino I’
                twice, when the second instance should have mentioned ‘Violino II, so that was corrected. The
                original gave ’B. c.’, which was changed to ‘Basso continuo’.
            •   Abbreviations of the instrument names were added throughout the score where there were none
                in the original, i.e. ‘V. I, V. II, S. I, S.II, etc’.
            •   We changed the title of the score to match the wording on the CD. The original score was enti-
                tled ‘Beatus primo, Selva morale et spiritual (1940/41) …’ but we changed this to ‘Beatus vir
                by C. Monteverdi’.
            •   The score was cut short just after bar 47.
                                        The date of modiﬁcation was 22 May 2012.]
