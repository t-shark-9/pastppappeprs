Subject Details: Design Technology HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 40 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 60 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalise candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for stating the type of load exerted by the wind on the roof of the
                  airport building.
                  external;                                                                             [1]

           (ii) Award [1] for stating the drawing technique used to create the sketch design.
                perspective;
                freehand drawing/perspective;                                                       [1 max]

           (iii) Award [1] for each point in an outline of the idea generating technique most
                 likely used by the designer for the shape of the airport [2 max].
                 analogy;
                 idea taken from the shape of a bird/aircraft (two wings and a tail);                   [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for calculating the floor area of the total airport site area and [1]
                  for calculating the percentage of the floor area in relation to the site area.
                  floor area: 570 000 + 140 000 = 710 000 m2;
                  site area: 1255 hectares = 12 550 000m2 = 5.7 %; (allow 5.6 %)                        [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for stating a reason why there are more seats per unit floor area
                  in Terminal 1 than in Terminal 2 and [1] for a brief explanation
                  [2 max].
                  passengers will move through to Terminal 1 after check-in to await their
                  flight;
                  therefore fewer seats are needed;

                  Terminal 2 is only used when Terminal 1 exceeds capacity;
                  so, at many times of the year Terminal 2 will not be used/there are no
                  departure gates in Terminal 2;                                                    [2 max]

     (c)   (i)    Award [1] for stating how the two pieces of data for the passenger check-in
                  counters at Terminal 2 are related.
                  each counter can be operated as a single or double check-in;                          [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each point in an explanation of which terminal is likely to be
                  the most crowded at capacity [3 max].
                  Terminal 2, as it has 25 % of the floor area compared to Terminal 1;
                  though if all check-ins are in use it has 39 % passenger check-in capacity of
                  Terminal 1;
                  and only 8.5 % of the seating capacity of Terminal 1;                                 [3]

     (d)   (i)    Award [1] for stating the year with the least amount of energy consumed per
                  passenger.
                  2007–2008;                                                                            [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each discrete point in a discussion of the pattern of energy
                  consumption per passenger between the years 2004 and 2009 [3 max].
                  2004–2005 most energy consumption but in subsequent years the trend is a
                  reduction of consumption;
                  though in 2008–2009 there is the same amount of passengers as in 2007–2008;
                  but more energy is consumed per passenger which bucks the trend;                      [3]
                                                    –7–                N12/4/DESTE/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     (e)   (i)    Award [1] for calculating the number of tonnes of timber based materials recycled in
                  the year 2009–10 and [1] for calculating the percentage.
                  535.6  456.4  992.00 tonnes ;
                    86 %;                                                                         [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for identifying the material group that is likely to be most difficult
                  to recycle and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                  plastics;
                  because they will be composed of thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics
                  which will need sorting in order to be recycled separately/thermosets are
                  difficult to recycle                                                                    [2]



2.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the type of deformation a material undergoes beyond its
           yield point.
           plastic;                                                                                       [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each discrete point in an explanation of the relationship between
           deflection and stiffness in structures [3 max].
           if an external load is applied to some part of a structure, that part will be deflected;
           the amount of deflection depends on the size of the load;
           and the stiffness of the structure;                                                            [3]



3.   (a)   Award [1] for each point in a description of biofuel [2 max].
           fuel which is derived from natural materials;
           e.g. waste cooking oil (vegetable/sunflower);                                                  [2]

     (b)   Award [1] for each point in a description of the function of clean coal technology
           [2 max].
           reduction of environmental impact of coal energy generation;
           by eliminating/reducing carbon dioxide emissions;                                              [2]



4.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the type of gear system used in a metal lathe mechanism.
           compound;
           worm ;                                                                                     [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a discussion of belt and chain drive
           mechanical systems in relation to performance and cost [3 max].
           if the distance between the shafts is large in a belt drive system it will tend to slip
           and so be less efficient than a chain drive system which does not slip;
           but a chain drive system is more expensive both in capital cost/maintenance cost;
           and a belt drive can be used with variable speed cones;                                        [3]

5.   (a)   Award [1] for each of two functions of the resin in the process of hand lay-up
           moulding [2 max].
           fills any gaps in the fibreglass;
           provides a smooth finish;
           colour;
           hard surface/durability;
           binds the fibreglass together;                                                     [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one benefit of using the technique of
           vacuum bagging in a composite lay-up process [2 max].
           large products are possible;
           because the air pressure is evenly distributed across the mould;

           good quality products can be made;
           through the use of pre-pregs;

           clean production method;
           with little waste;

           low moulding costs;
           because the process requires little maintenance/is cheap to install;

           cost effective;
           when used for complex shapes;                                                      [2 max]



6.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the definition of the term building envelope.
           the exterior surface of a building’s construction (walls, windows, floor, roof)/
           building shell;                                                                        [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how the selection of
           different construction materials can contribute to the heat loss or gain from a
           building [3 max].
           different materials have different U-values/properties;
           the U-value is a measure of the thermal conductance of a material;
           the higher the U-value, the greater the conduction;
           components of the envelope can create paths for the transfer of thermal energy;    [3 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of one physical property required for
                  the surface finish of the Embrace coffee table [2 max].
                  hard;
                  resistance to scratching;                                                           [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of one reason for designing the coffee
                  tables with a choice of surface finishes [2 max].
                  widens the market/different tastes;
                  consumers can match colour/grain pattern with other furniture/surroundings;         [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each point in a discussion of one ergonomic consideration
                  for the design of the handholds in the smaller version of the tables in
                  Figure 6 [3 max].

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for each point of an outline of the scale of production for the
             Embrace coffee tables [2 max].
             batch;
             not a mass market product/available in different surface veneers;                [2]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of three advantages of
             manufacturing the coffee tables with the technique of lamination [3 max]
             per advantage.
             lamination does not require a solid piece of flawless timber;
             it is constructed of thin strips of timber;
             which can come from different trees;

             laminated timber is strong;
             due to the use of adhesives;
             between each layer;

             lamination is cost-effective;
             for various scales of production;
             reduced waste/same mould can be used both parts of the table;

             customisation;
             lamination allows just the surface laminate/veneer;
             to be changed according to order;

             laminating is suitable for curved shapes;
             the strength of the glue helps to keep the shape;
             by preventing spring back;

             laminated timber has good strength to weight ratio;
             which means it can be used for slender structures;
             and so increase aesthetic appeal;                                            [9 max]

8.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of why the Dyson fan has been
                  designed to oscillate 90° [2 max].
                  in order to spread the effect of the cool air;
                  across a wide area in front of the fan/from a corner position;                        [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of why the Dyson fan has been
                  designed with a tilting mechanism [2 max].
                  so that airflow can be directed at different angles;
                  in order to accommodate users in different positions/increase comfort;                [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of one advantage of the Dyson fan
                  operating with a smooth airflow [2 max].
                  eliminates the buffeting of air which is usually produced by fans with blades;
                  so loose paper on a desk will not be disturbed/blown away/increased
                  comfort for the user;                                                                 [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each point in an explanation of the need for a large design
                  team to develop the Dyson fan [3 max].
                  the fan required a complex research and development phase;
                  with involvement from a range of specialists/different expertise for different
                  aspects of the product;
                  difficult/impossible for one person to have all the skills/knowledge required /
                  new/radical technology;                                                           [3 max]

     (c)   (i)    Award [1] for each point in an outline of one way in which the Dyson fan
                  has been designed to accommodate a wide percentile range [2 max].
                  adjustable;
                  so it can be used by people of different heights to increase comfort;                 [2]

           (ii)   Award [3] for each advantage of the Dyson fan in Figure 7 compared to the
                  conventional fan in Figure 8 in relation to ease of maintenance, safety and
                  aesthetics [3 max] per aspect.
                  ease-of-maintenance:
                  no blades/grill;
                  so easier to keep clean;
                  no dust/dirt traps;

                  safety:
                  no blades so safer;
                  less chance of someone cutting themselves;
