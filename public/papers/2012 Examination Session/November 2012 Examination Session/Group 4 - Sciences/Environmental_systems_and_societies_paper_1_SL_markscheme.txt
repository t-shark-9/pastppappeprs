Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [45 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording
      can be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF
      (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

1.   (a)   (altitudinal) zonation;                                                                      [1]

     (b)   lack of water (due to permafrost);

           Accept other reasonable suggestions. Do not credit altitude, oxygen, sunlight, low
           rainfall or stating only ‘temperature’ / ‘humidity’.

     (c)   each zone will move further up the mountain;
           (shift in rainfall patterns may result in) disappearance of one (or more) type of
           vegetation;                                                                              [1 max]
           Accept other reasonable responses.
           Give credit if candidate identifies one vegetation type and suggests how it will be
           found at a higher location.
           Do not accept “melting of snow” unless related to a change in vegetation.



2.   (a)   (hardy) species able to withstand difficult conditions / species in the first stage of
           succession / species beginning (initiating) ecological succession / OWTTE;                   [1]
           Do not credit definition of ‘invasive species’.

     (b)   loss of biodiversity / may outcompete native species / may disrupt food chains as
           particular prey is consumed / may block sunlight (preventing photosynthesis) /
           may provide additional food source;                                                          [1]

     (c)   pollution of nearby groundwater/ lakes/ rivers;
           herbicides may kill other species in addition to the target species;

           species higher up the food chain may be particularly affected / biomagnification;
           development of herbicide resistance;

3.   (a)   the gain by producers in energy or biomass (per unit area per unit time) remaining
           after allowing for respiratory losses / gross productivity minus respiration / rate of
           photosynthesis minus (rate of) respiration / NPP is the amount of energy or
           biomass available to consumers in an ecosystem;                                              [1]
           Do not accept only equation NPP = GPP – R without explanation of what the
           symbols mean.

     (b)   more light/insolation around the equator (sun directly overhead) so higher NPP;
           warmer in tropics so higher NPP;
           NPP is limited by availability of water / NPP is limited by precipitation rates /
           NPP is limited by bands of aridity at approximately 30 degrees North and South
           of equator / NPP is higher around the equator since precipitation is heaviest (due
           to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ));
           NPP is low at high latitudes due to low light intensity/ low temperatures/
           permanent darkness in winter;                                                            [2 max]
           Do not credit soil fertility or only reference to location without discussion of the
           climatic factors of light/temperature/precipitation.

     (c)   presence of endemic species;
           high (rates of) biodiversity (biological hotspots);
           presence of keystone species;
           iconic landscapes / high aesthetic value;
           ecosystems which provide an important ecological service e.g. climate regulation
           (rainforests);                                                                           [2 max]
           Do not credit high net primary production rates.

     (d)   name of area e.g. Amazonian Rainforest
           under threat from economic interests such as logging companies/ mining
           companies/ small-scale farmers;
           underlying cause of the problem is underdevelopment/ political corruption/
           short-term approach to the forest/ population growth;                                    [1 max]
           To award the single [1] mark, a named area must be included in the response
           (naming a biome e.g. tundra is not sufficient) together with stating a human
           activity and relating it to a specific threat.
           Allow any other reasonable example.

           The food production system should be named (e.g. beef production/arable
           farming) but the name does not need to be in a box.
           Do not accept “technology” without a specific example e.g. pest resistant crop
           seeds. Do not accept “capital” without example of how money is used e.g.
           farming labour.
           Do not accept ‘food’ (as either input or output) without specific example
           (e.g.cattle feed or beef).
           Do not credit answers that have similar inputs/outputs (e.g for outputs – (1) fruit

(d)   footprint for a meat eater is likely to be much larger than for a vegetarian;
      production of meat requires a greater energy input than growing crops;
      (meat eater is) eating at a higher trophic level;
      means land is required to create feed for livestock and for raising livestock;
      transport of meat for processing will increase the footprint size;
      diet based on imported goods will lead to a bigger footprint / local goods will lead
      to a smaller footprint;
      more fossil fuel consumed in process of transportation;
      increase in material consumption for packaging;
      greater (food) consumption will mean a bigger footprint;
      more natural resources (land, fossil fuel, irrigation) required for meeting increased
      demand;                                                                                 [2 max]

           are not equipped with the economic/medical resources to evacuate people/cope
           with large numbers of migrants;
           have higher populations so more people at risk;
           populations are already vulnerable and therefore any drop in living standards will
           affect them to a greater degree;
           have fewer resources to pay for engineering works such as coastal defences to
           offset threats;                                                                          [2 max]

      more mosquitoes that may cause diseases           increases in stagnant water due to
      (like malaria);                                   flooding (increase in mosquito habitat);
      succumbing easier to disease (especially          as people are forced to migrate;
      for children and elderly) / suffering;
      spreading of new (for a specific locality)        changes in distribution of organisms
      diseases;                                         such as invasive species/ pathogens/

      malnutrition / hunger (which evidently            saltwater intrusion onto coastal
      increases the risk for disease / reduces          agricultural land means reduction in
