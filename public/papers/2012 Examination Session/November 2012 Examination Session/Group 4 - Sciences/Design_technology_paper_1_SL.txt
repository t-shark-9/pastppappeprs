3.    Figure 1 shows an elevator (lift) shaft in a busy office building with a number of people waiting
      to board. The elevator receives instructions via display panels on the wall next to the elevator on
      each floor (floorcall) or from the panel within the elevator (panelcall). If the elevator is travelling
      up the elevator shaft it continues upwards until it has serviced all the calls or it reaches the top of the
      elevator shaft. It then changes direction and travels down servicing calls as it goes down until there
      are no more calls or it reaches the bottom of the elevator shaft when it again changes direction.
