Figure 2     Background Information to the Danube River delta


   • The Danube is the longest river in the European Union. It flows through or forms the borders of
     ten countries.
   • The Danube River delta marks the point where the Danube River flows into the Black Sea.
   • The Danube River delta includes UNESCO Biosphere Reserves and a World Natural Heritage site.
   • A delta is a fan-shaped landform that is created at the mouth of a river where the river flows into
     an ocean, sea or lake.
   • A delta is formed by the continuous deposition (dropping) of sediment that has been carried by
     the river. Sediment adds height to the delta and helps it extend out into the sea.
   • A river can divide into separate channels as it goes across its delta.
   • The Danube River delta is a wetland ecosystem rich in plants (over 1000 species), birds
     (300 species, including the largest pelican colony in Europe) and fish (including several endangered
     species of sturgeon).
   • Moldova is a country which takes nearly 20 % of its water supply requirements from a branch of
     the Danube.

Figure 8    Dredging techniques


  To ensure that the sediment carried by the river does not interfere with navigation, regular dredging
  of the river must be carried out. This involves scooping out sediment using heavy machinery.
  Dredging has also been used to straighten channels.
