                               School Facts


            Rose Gilbert is old enough to be the great great grandmother of her
             students at Palisades Charter High School in Los Angeles. The 91 year
             old teacher has been doing the same job for 55 years. Although she is a
             millionaire she refuses to retire.



                   At just 16 years old, Babar Ali became headmaster of his own school
                    in West Bengal. The hard-working boy has 326 pupils to look after.
                    People think he is the youngest headmaster in the world. He organizes
                    the school in his family’s garden and checks that the pupils attend
                    regularly and that homework is handed in on time.



              A deaf dog called Sparky has learnt sign language with the help of the
               Missouri School for the Deaf. The owners of Sparky abandoned the dog.
               Now it lives at the school and the pupils have taught the dog to understand
               three commands: “sit”, “lie down” and “stop”. He is in the process of
               learning “food” and “outside”. Another deaf dog has recently joined
               the programme.



                   Mary-Lu Kennedy was the first of 12 students to graduate with an MA
                    (a master’s degree) in “The Beatles, Popular Music and Society” at
                    the University of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. Newspapers have
                    criticized the degree as “useless” but Mary-Lu says that “the course was
                    challenging and enjoyable. It helped me understand the influence of
                    The Beatles on all aspects of life.”



            The world’s smallest school, which consists of 4 students and a
             12 square metre classroom, is situated in a tiny village called Kalou in
             southern Iran. The school has been officially recognized by UNESCO as
             the smallest in the world. It now receives gifts every day: textbooks,
             computers and even chocolates.

                                                             Adapted from Holland Herald, May 2011.

           The Cairngorm Challenge is a hike and bike
            adventure which takes place in the beautiful
            Cairngorms National Park on Saturday 10
            September.

           Why the Cairngorm Challenge is a “must do” event

 10         Title [ – 1 – ]
            The Cairngorms National Park is an area of incredible natural beauty. It includes
            the majestic Cairngorm (one of Scotland’s highest mountains), forests, rivers and
            breathtaking landscapes. The park also has diverse wildlife.

            Title [ – 2 – ]
 15         In order to protect the valuable and delicate environment
            of the Cairngorms, events of this size do not happen
            often. The Cairngorm Challenge is the best opportunity
            to hike and bike through this area, explore the park and
            go on a real adventure.

 20         Title [ – X – ]
            The Cairngorm Challenge makes an interesting alternative weekend for you and your
            family or friends. Most charity challenges are aimed at individuals. Here, you can take

            other members to keep going when the adventure gets diﬃcult.

            Use this incredible achievement to collect money for some of Scotland’s youth who
            need support. You can help young people like Heather.

            At 16, she had no support from a loving family and she had nowhere to go. People like
            you helped collect the money so that Heather could move into a nice home and get help
 35         to pay the rent.

            We ask all people taking part in the Cairngorm Challenge to collect at least £400 to give
            practical help to young people like Heather.

                   Martin Luther King celebration:
                   a day of service
                                                                                   [Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
                                                                                   File:Martin_Luther_King_Jr_NYWTS.jpg]

         Martin Luther King Junior said “Everybody can be great … because anybody can serve. You don’t
         have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace.”

         For twenty-ﬁve years, Martin Luther King Junior’s life has been celebrated as a national holiday.
         Hundreds of Kauaians* are expected to meet on Monday to honour his message of peace.
 5       Martin Luther King said that he wanted to be remembered as someone who served the community.
         For that reason, his family asked that Martin Luther King Day is, above all, a day of service.

         Martin Luther King celebrations include a very full two hour programme with live entertainment
         and presentations from leaders of all religions. Monday’s celebration will emphasize youth
         involvement and volunteer opportunities. From 11 am to 1:30 pm at the Kauai Grove Centre, local
 10      artists, religious leaders, volunteer organizations and politicians will work together in a programme
         designed to inspire youth and adults to take action in their communities. A dozen volunteer
         organizations will be there to distribute information. People who want to come to the celebration
         but who cannot volunteer can still contribute to it: they can bring food for people in need or give
         unwanted cell phones to be recycled.

 15      “The celebrations are always moving because there are people who entertain with music or prayer,”
         said Jim Jennings, the director of the local hospice. “This year’s programme is going to be a mix of
         politicians talking about Martin Luther King, organizations talking about volunteer opportunities,
         diﬀerent island artists, poetry reading and music.”

         The programme will open with a traditional Hawaiian greeting. Diﬀerent religious leaders will talk.
 20      According to Jim Jennings, Kauai is an example of tolerance and diversity. “There’s lots of diﬀerent
         people living together and helping each other. Kauai is a good example of how Dr. King encouraged
         communities to live.”

                    Make the most of the weekend

             The weekend is here once again which means that it is time to have some fun
            with your family, relax with your friends or just spend some quiet time by yourself.
            There are many activities to enjoy.

             A lot of people enjoy shopping. The weekend is a
            wonderful time to go shopping to see the latest fashions
            and buy new clothes. Since you will soon all be going
            back to school, it is also the best time to go looking for
            school clothes and books. Another particular luxury for
            the weekend is to watch TV. Some people enjoy watching
            a sports programme. A lot of people love to rent a movie and sit around the
            television with their family and friends.

             Some people like to do a little gardening but cannot seem to ﬁnd the time.
            The weekend is a great time to do such a thing. Get out your tools and seeds and
            enjoy nature!

             Sports are also one of the weekend’s most popular activities. Go and watch
            a professional game or play one yourself or with your friends. Playing a team
                                 sport is an excellent opportunity to make new friends and
                                 improve old friendships. Doing sports not only gives you
                                 the enjoyment of competition but it teaches you about the
                                 values of good sportsmanship and it keeps you ﬁt. Sports
                                 provide you with the exercise you need to stay healthy and
                                 of course every game improves your skills as a player.

             In Suva, Nadi, Lautoka and in many other towns on our island of Fiji,
            there are internet cafes where you can play different online computer games and
            video games. Some young people prefer to play computer games with their friends
            at home.

             There are so many different activities that people can enjoy during the
            weekend. Whether you go swimming, shopping or go to the cinema, it is important
            to make the most of the weekend.


                                                                   Adapted from Fiji Sun, 23 January 2010
