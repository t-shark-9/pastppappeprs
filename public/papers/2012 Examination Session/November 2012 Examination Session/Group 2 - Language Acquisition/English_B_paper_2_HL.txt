Complete one of the following tasks in at least 400 words.

1.    “The best literary works always have a happy ending.”   Your teacher has set this as the topic of
      your next essay.  Write your essay.


2.    You are going to take part in a class debate on the motion: “It is better to choose a university course
      that you want to study rather than one that your parents prefer”.   Write the text of your speech,
      either agreeing or disagreeing with this motion.


3.    As a CAS activity you spent last summer helping an aid organization in a developing country.  
      Write an article for the school newspaper describing your experience and saying how you think it
      has changed your plans for the future.


4.    You interview a popular singer who has just given a very successful concert in your town.  
      Write a report of this interview for your school newspaper.  Do not simply write the exact words
      (transcript) of the interview.


5.    Your school organizes a one-week student trip every year.   The last trip was not a success.  
      Write a letter to the school principal explaining what went wrong with the trip and how future trips
      could be improved.


6.    Imagine that you meet someone who has been transported in time from over 100 years ago to
      the present.  Write a short story for the school magazine about what happened and what you both felt
      when you spent a day together.
