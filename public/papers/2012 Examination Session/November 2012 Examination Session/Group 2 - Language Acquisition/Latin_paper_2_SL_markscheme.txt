General notes:
 The following paragraphs are to be considered suggestions, rather than prescriptions, i.e. all points
  made by candidates to be marked on their merits.
 Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
 The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: e.g. double mention of alliteration.
