These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts that are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following
requirements.

1.    “The best literary works always have a happy ending.” Your teacher has set this as the
      topic of your next essay. Write your essay.

      Argument – semi-formal to formal – essay

      A good answer:
      • will adopt a register and tone that is semi-formal to formal
      • will use cohesive devices and paragraphing that help to make explanation and argument
        clear
      • will include clear and helpful introduction and conclusion
      • will make reference to one or more specific works or literary techniques
      • will give reasons and examples for the points made
      • will not retell complete plots but rather select and summarise plot information so as to
        support the argument
      • may be either balanced review of the issue, or a statement of opinion supporting one point
        of view.


2.    You are going to take part in a class debate on the motion: “It is better to choose a university
      course that you want to study rather than one that your parents prefer”. Write the text of
      your speech, either agreeing or disagreeing with this motion.

      Argument/controversial – semi-formal to formal – text of a speech

      A good answer:
      • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register with possible informality at times
      • will have a clear sense of address to audience at the start, throughout and at the end
        (e.g. use of “you”, “I”, “we”)
      • will use the rhetorical devices of a speech
      • will be clearly either for or against the motion
      • will provide reasons for the points made
      • may mention opposing arguments in order to refute them; this should be rewarded
      • may create impact through the use of relevant personal examples; this should be rewarded.

3.   As a CAS activity you spent last summer helping an aid organization in a developing country.
     Write an article for the school newspaper describing your experience and saying how you
     think it has changed your plans for the future.

     Description and analysis/factual and subjective – semi-formal – school newspaper article

     A good answer:
     • is likely to be fairly formal in register but appropriate informal treatments should be
       accepted
     • will have a title
     • will refer to an aid organization, although not necessarily in a developing country
     • will describe what the work was and how he/she contributed to it
     • will clearly explain changed future plans
     • will both “describe” and “explain”, but need not give equal importance or length to the two
       elements. If one of the elements is not included, or not developed (i.e. merely mentioned
       in passing), no more than 4 should be awarded for Criterion C
     • may include vivid descriptions or lively anecdotes to increase impact; this should be
       rewarded.


4.   You interview a popular singer who has just given a very successful concert in your town.
     Write a report of this interview for your school newspaper. Do not simply write the exact
     words (transcript) of the interview.

     Reported spoken interaction – semi-formal – article

     A good answer:
     • will adopt a semi-formal register
     • will report the interview and not transcribe it. If the transcribed form is used, no more than
       4 should be awarded – unless all other aspects of Criterion B are very well handled, in
       which case a maximum of 6 may be awarded.
     • will have a title
     • will include an introduction and a conclusion which have some impact
     • will summarise information and ideas from the interview, and support these with relevant
       direct quotations appropriately incorporated into the text
     • will mention the popularity of the singer and the success of the concert
     • may analyse critically the popularity and success of the singer; this should be rewarded
     • may have flashes of humour and originality; this should be rewarded.

5.   Your school organizes a one-week student trip every year. The last trip was not a success.
     Write a letter to the school principal explaining what went wrong with the trip and how future
     trips could be improved.

     Factual and argumentative/explanation – formal – letter

     A good answer:
     • will adopt a formal register
     • will adopt a suitable tone of respect
     • will use some elements of formal letter format (address and date (optional), greeting,
       salutation) – even if the text is sent via e-mail
     • will make clear what was wrong with the previous trip
     • will provide specific examples to illustrate what went wrong
     • will make specific and reasonable proposals for next year
     • may use the subheadings and bullet points of a proposal.


6.   Imagine that you meet someone who has been transported in time from over 100 years ago to
     the present. Write a short story for the school magazine about what happened and what you
     both felt when you spent a day together.

     Narration/imaginative – informal to semi-formal – anecdote

     A good answer:
     • will adopt an informal to semi-formal register appropriate to the content
     • will have a title
     • will use key elements of the story text type: contextualisation, sequence of events, ending
     • will describe the feelings of the writer and the time traveller in detail
     • may have some overall message; this should be rewarded
     • may round off the story in an unexpected way (e.g. the writer returns with the time
       traveller to his/her age); this should be rewarded
     • may include dialogue between the writer and the time traveller; this should be rewarded
     • may have touches of humour; this should be rewarded.
