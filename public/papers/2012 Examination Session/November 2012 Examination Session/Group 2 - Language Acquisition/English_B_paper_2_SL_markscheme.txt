These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

1.    Your school is considering reducing the time devoted to sports in order to give more lessons.
      Write a letter to the school principal either supporting or objecting to this idea.

      Argument/controversial – formal – letter

      A good answer:
      • will adopt a formal register
      • will use the format of a formal letter (address and date (optional), greeting, closing
        salutation)
      • will adopt a suitable tone of respect
      • will support one side of the argument. Failure to do so will reduce the mark for relevance
        in Criterion C, as merely “generally relevant”
      • will give reasons for the points made
      • may mention opposing arguments in order to refute them; this should be rewarded.


2.    Write a diary entry that begins with these words: “I thought the weekend was going to be
      boring, but …”.

      Narration/reflection – informal – diary entry

      A good answer:
      • will adopt an informal register
      • will include features of a diary entry (e.g. date)
      • will begin with the words given in the question. If these words do not appear, award a
        maximum of [9 marks] for Criterion C
      • will clearly convey the excitement or interest of the weekend
      • will include an element of reflection
      • will personalize the content
      • may have some twist in the narrative or an unexpected ending; this should be rewarded
      • may explain briefly why the weekend was expected to be boring; this should be rewarded.
                                               –4–             N12/2/ABENG/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Your best friend recently moved to another town and is having difficulty adapting to a
     new school. Write an e-mail to him/her mentioning the problems and offering advice.

     Written interaction – informal – e-mail

     A good answer:
     • will adopt an informal register
     • will offer advice in an encouraging way
     • will adopt a friendly tone
     • will use any of the greetings and goodbyes appropriate to an e-mail
     • will cover both aspects of the question; the problems and the advice. Failure to do so will
       reduce the mark for relevance in Criterion C
     • will back up the advice with reasons
     • may adopt an e-mail format (e.g. “To” and “Subject”); this should be rewarded.

     Note: Some limited use of Textese (e.g. 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
           permissible.


4.   Write a review for your school newspaper of a film that you have recently enjoyed. Do not
     simply retell the story.

     Analysis and critique/subjective – semi-formal – review

     A good answer:
     • will adopt a semi-formal register
     • will have a title and the name of the reviewer
     • will use a lively style which will engage the readers
     • will identify the film
     • will make clear why the film was enjoyed
     • will discuss various aspects such as characters, acting or soundtrack
     • will not just retell the plot
     • will recommend readers to see the film
     • may have flashes of informality that convey a personal tone; this should be rewarded
     • may use a system of ratings, for example stars; this should be rewarded.
