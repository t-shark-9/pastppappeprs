Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

      (a)   The random variable X represents the height of a wave on a particular surf beach.
            It is known that X is normally distributed with unknown mean µ (metres) and
                                   1
            known variance σ 2 = (metres 2 ) . Sally wishes to test the claim made in a surf
                                   4
            guide that µ = 3 against the alternative that µ < 3 . She measures the heights
            of 36 waves and calculates their sample mean x . She uses this value to test the
            claim at the 5 % level.

		          (i)    Find a simple inequality, of the form x < A , where A is a number to
                   be determined to 4 significant figures, so that Sally will reject the null
                   hypothesis, that µ = 3 , if and only if this inequality is satisfied.

		          (ii)   Define a Type I error.

		          (iii) Define a Type II error.

		          (iv) Write down the probability that Sally makes a Type I error.

		          (v)    The true value of µ is 2.75. Calculate the probability that Sally makes a
                   Type II error.                                                                [11 marks]

      (b)   The random variable Y represents the height of a wave on another surf beach.
            It is known that Y is normally distributed with unknown mean µ (metres) and
            unknown variance σ 2 (metres 2 ) . David wishes to test the claim made in a surf
            guide that µ = 3 against the alternative that µ < 3 . He is also going to perform
            this test at the 5 % level. He measures the heights of 36 waves and finds that the
            sample mean, y = 2.860 and the unbiased estimate of the population variance,
              2
             sn−1 = 0.25 .



		          (i)    State the name of the test that David should perform.

		          (ii)   State the conclusion of David’s test, justifying your answer by giving
                   the p-value.

		          (iii) Using David’s results, calculate the 90 % confidence interval for µ , giving
                  your answers to 4 significant figures.                                         [8 marks]

      Jenny and her Dad frequently play a board game. Before she can start Jenny has to
      throw a “six” on an ordinary six-sided dice. Let the random variable X denote the
      number of times Jenny has to throw the dice in total until she obtains her first “six”.

      (a)   If the dice is fair, write down the distribution of X , including the value of any
            parameter(s).                                                                           [1 mark]

      Before Jenny’s Dad can start, he has to throw two “sixes” using a fair, ordinary
