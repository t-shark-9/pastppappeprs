This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

It is the property of the International Baccalaureate and must not
be reproduced or distributed to any other person without the
authorization of the IB Assessment Centre.

General Marking Instructions

After marking a sufficient number of scripts to become familiar with the markscheme and
candidates’ responses to all or the majority of questions, Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be
contacted by their Team Leader (TL). The purpose of this contact is to discuss the standard
of marking, the interpretation of the markscheme and any difficulties with particular questions.
It may be necessary to review your initial marking after contacting your TL. DO NOT BEGIN
THE FINAL MARKING OF YOUR SCRIPTS IN RED INK UNTIL YOU RECEIVE
NOTIFICATION THAT THE MARKSCHEME IS FINALIZED. You will be informed by
e-mail, fax or post of modifications to the markscheme and should receive these about one week
after the date of the examination. If you have not received them within 10 days you should
contact your TL and the IB Assessment Centre. Make an allowance for any difference in time
zone before calling. AEs WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY
NOT BE INVITED TO MARK IN FUTURE SESSIONS.


You should contact the TL whose name appears on your “Allocation of Schools listing” sheet.


Note:
Please use a personal courier service when sending sample materials to TLs unless postal services can
be guaranteed. Record the costs on your examiner claim form.

General Marking Instructions
1.    Once markscheme is received mark in pencil until final markscheme is received.

2.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. Indeed,
      another examiner may have arrived at the opposite decision. In these cases write a brief annotation
      in the left-hand margin to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking.

5.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

6.    Record subtotals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer. Show a mark for each part question (a), (b), etc. Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total
      mark for the question in the right-hand margin opposite the last line of the answer.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin.

8.    Section A: Add together the total for the section and write it in the Examiner Column on the cover
                 sheet.
      Section B: Record the mark awarded for each of the six questions answered in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.
      Total:     Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.

9.    After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition of all marks to ensure that you have
      not made an arithmetical error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the
      cover sheet. We have script checking and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback
      to all examiners.

10.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.

11.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Once again
      make a comment to this effect in the left-hand margin.

Mark Allocation

Section A:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.
Section B:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
              Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

      (b)   Sequential/linear search;                                                                 [1 mark]

      (c)   (i)     Award up to [2 marks max].
                    Because 20 is not within the array
                    Logical expression !found always evaluates to true;
                    Execution of while loop will not terminate;
                    Run time error (array subscript out of bounds) will occur;
                    Accept infinite loop.                                                             [2 marks]

            (ii)    Award up to [3 marks max].
                    To terminate the execution of the while loop in finite number of times,
                    to avoid out of bounds error;
                    Boolean expression should be changed to
                    (!found && (pos < A.length));

                    Or
                    (!found && (A[pos] < target));

                    To alert the user about the error a suitable error message should be outputted;
                    If statement could be changed to if-else statement;

                    For example:

                    if (found)
                    { output(target + " is found at position " + pos); }
                    else
                    { output(target + " is not within the array "); }                                 [3 marks]

                                                                                            Total: [10 marks]
