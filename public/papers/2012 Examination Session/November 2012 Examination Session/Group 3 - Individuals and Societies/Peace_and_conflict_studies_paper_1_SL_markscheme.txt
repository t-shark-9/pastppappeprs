1.   Explain briefly the meaning of the following terms as used in the sources:

     (a)   Globalization (Source A line 23)                                               [2 marks]

           The candidate who makes a superficial attempt to explain the term will gain
           [0 marks]. The candidate gains [1 mark] for a sufficient explanation of the term such
           as “the widening, intensifying, speeding up, and growing impact of world-wide
           interconnectedness” (Held and McGrew). The candidate will gain a second mark for a
           reference to the source with an additional analysis, such as how international investors
           can have a direct, adverse impact on the livelihoods of local communities. Candidates
           who meet the [1 mark] response but also make reference to Peace and Conflict theory
           can also achieve [2 marks].

     (b)   Dependency theory (Source B line 3)                                            [2 marks]

           The candidate who simply rephrases the term will gain [0 marks]. The candidate gains
           [1 mark] for a sufficient explanation of the term such as “viewing development as
           a global system in which the core exploits the periphery”. The candidate will gain a
           second mark for a reference to the source with an additional analysis, such as how it
           perceives elites of countries to work together, resulting in various protest movements of
           the remaining “99 %” such as the Occupy movement. Candidates who meet the
           [1 mark] response but also make reference to Peace and Conflict theory can also
           achieve [2 marks].



2.   Source B states “for the global rich to remain rich, the global poor
     must remain poor” (line 11). To what extent is this statement supported by
     Sources A and C?                                                                    [4 marks]

     Candidates must relate the statement of Source B to both Sources A and C. Answers relating
     to only A or C will be awarded a maximum of [2 marks]. Answers should focus on
     arguments to be found in the sources against and in favour of the statement. [1 mark] will be
     awarded for a superficial attempt to answer the question. Answers that only mention
     arguments in favour or against the statement can receive a maximum of [2 marks].
     For [3 marks] the candidate will mention at least one argument in favour and against the
     statement from each source. [4 marks] will be awarded for an exemplary answer which
     shows how A and C support the statement and how they show an alternative viewpoint to that
     of the statement.

3.   To what extent is the Human Development Index (HDI) in Source D
     a satisfactory way of measuring development? Identify at least two other
     ways of measuring development that could be used, and explain how these
     may be better, or worse, than the HDI.                                            [4 marks]

     [1 mark] will be awarded for a superficial attempt to answer the question (for example,
     only explaining what the HDI measures). Answers that only use one alternative to measure
     development will gain [2 marks]. For [3 marks] the candidate will at least identify
     two alternatives and how they might be better or worse than the HDI. [4 marks] will be
     awarded for an exemplary answer, showing a deeper understanding of the difficulty of
     measuring development and the pros and cons of the various methods.



4.   With reference to the sources and your own knowledge, examine how aid can
     be beneficial to the recipients, but can also create “structures of violence”.    [8 marks]

     This is a mini-essay. Candidates should analyse aid and present arguments about its
     advantages and disadvantages in the context of these sources. Answers that use only own
     knowledge or only information from the sources can receive a maximum of [4 marks]. For
     [1–2 marks] the candidate must examine superficially. For [3–4 marks] the candidate must
     answer the question with satisfactory but limited arguments or with little reference to the
     sources. [5–6 marks] will be awarded if the candidate manages to critically examine aid in a
     relevant and accurate way. The candidate must develop a solid thesis followed by a
     compelling and relevant argument. [7–8 marks] will be given if the candidate offers deeper
     insight beyond these references. Full marks can also be awarded to answers challenging the
     assumptions in the question in a profound way, showing insights beyond the demands of the
     question.
