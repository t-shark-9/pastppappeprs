(b)   Evaluate the reasons why a government might allow a competitor into an
      industry that was previously a monopoly.                                   [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • reasons for allowing competition:
        – to improve allocative efficiency
        – to lower price
        – to encourage innovation
        – to improve quality of product/service
      • reasons for not allowing competition:
        – loss of economies of scale (natural monopoly)
        – it may discourage innovation in some industries e.g. research and
           development (R&D)
        – if the competition is foreign based it may damage domestic trade and
           jobs
      • use of diagram(s) to illustrate market structure
      • use of examples.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short term versus long term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

      Answers may include:
      • when it may be effective:
        – progressive taxation – fairness, ability to pay, raises tax revenue
        – spending on merit goods and public goods – used by people on
          low incomes, positive externalities
        – transfer payments – direct benefit to the neediest, automatic stabilizer
        – the use of subsidies – reduces the cost and increases consumption
        – price ceilings – affordability to people on low incomes
        – price floors – income support for farmers
        – minimum wages – incentives, reasonable pay
      • where it may not be effective:
        – progressive taxation – disincentives, avoidance, tax evasion, cost of
          administration, the Laffer curve
        – spending on merit goods and public goods – expensive to provide
        – transfer payments – cost of provision, can be paid to people who don’t
          need it, reduces incentive to work
        – the use of subsidies – cost of provision, allocative inefficiency
        – price ceilings – distorts markets, shortages, allocative inefficiency, costs
          of administration
        – price floors – distorts markets, surpluses, allocative inefficiency, costs of
          administration
        – minimum wages – distorts the labour market, raises business costs.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short term versus long term consequences

      • where policies might help correct the current account:
        – the devaluation/depreciation of the domestic currency could boost
          exports and reduce imports (expenditure switching). This depends on the
          Marshall Lerner condition
        – trade barriers could be used to reduce imports (expenditure switching)
        – tight monetary and fiscal policy could be used to reduce imports
          (expenditure reducing)
        – tight monetary and fiscal policy could be used to reduce inflation and
          improve export competitiveness
        – supply side policies could be used to improve the competitiveness of
          domestic firms
      • where policies might not help correct the current account:
        – devaluation/depreciation increases import prices and adds to inflation,
          reducing domestic competitiveness
        – trade barriers lead to retaliation which reduces exports and increases
          domestic costs and domestic and global resource misallocation
        – tight fiscal and monetary policies reduce domestic economic growth
          and employment
        – supply-side policies need time to work and reduce a deficit.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short term versus long term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.
