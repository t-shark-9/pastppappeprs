                                                  –3–              N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The purpose of Paper 2 is to give candidates the opportunity to demonstrate the following skills:
comprehension, analysis, evaluation and application. Each of the questions in the source-based exercise
can be classified as one of four types but questions may be classified as a mixture:
comprehension/analysis, comprehension/application, or analysis/evaluation. The wording of each
question will indicate the kind of answer required.

    Comprehension: Marks are awarded according to the extent to which the candidate can put into his
     or her own words the explicit message of the document or selected parts of it.

    Analysis: Marks are awarded according to the extent to which the candidate can make inferences,
     perceive internal relationships, compare and contrast documents, and persuasively explain the
     meaning and significance of a document or a combination of documents.

    Evaluation: Marks are awarded according to the extent to which the candidate can identify and
     evaluate different interpretations presented in the documents, or can evaluate the source material
     critically as evidence.

    Application: Marks are awarded according to the extent to which the candidate can achieve
     understanding of the documents, beyond what is possible from internal analysis alone, by applying
     relevant knowledge to them, or by placing the documents in a wider historical context.

The markscheme for Paper 2 relates to the areas for study suggested for Topic 1 and Topic 3 and tests the
four skills outlined above. However, its range of possible answers is not exhaustive. Although it tests a
common set of skills, it recognizes that their application may demonstrate variation, and the range of
appropriate specific knowledge may not be exactly alike across candidates and schools.

                                              SECTION A

Greek and Roman Epic

Question 1. (a) – (d) relates to Athene intervening to stop Achilles killing Agamemnon and to
Mercury intervening to stop Aeneas staying with Dido. The accompanying sources are Sources A and B
in the Source Booklet.

1.   (a)   Using details from Source A, explain how Homer demonstrates the special
           relationship between Achilles and the gods.                             [5 marks]

           Best answers will refer to (a) Hera’s initiative; (b) Athene’s manifestation to Achilles alone;
           (c) Achilles’ tone of complaint to Athene; (d) Athene’s restrained pleading/bargaining.

           Award [1–2 marks] for a generalized overview.

           Award [3–4 marks] for explanation substantiated with relevant references to Source A.

           Award [5 marks] for a balanced and effective discussion covering all relevant parts of the passage.

     (b)   Analyse the importance of Source B as a turning point in the plot of
           the Aeneid.                                                          [3 marks]

           3 mark answers will refer accurately to the direction of the plot both before and after this
           passage. For example, Aeneas has allowed himself to settle down with Dido without a full
           appreciation of the necessity of founding a new home for his Trojans in Italy; after this he will
           be totally driven by this sense of duty.

     (c)   With reference to Source A and Source B, compare and contrast the
           reactions of the two heroes to these sudden appearances by the gods. [4 marks]

           Best answers will recognize that both heroes react obediently to the god’s command,
           but Achilles after initial shock has the confidence to complain to Athene – “why come now?”.
           Aeneas is dumbstruck and his obedience is unconditional.

           Award [1 mark] for a generalized overview.

           Award [2–3 marks] for analysis substantiated with relevant references to Sources A and B.

           Award [4 marks] for, in addition, balanced and effective comparison and contrast, on Sources
           A and B.
                                             –5–               N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   With reference to Sources A and B, and using your knowledge of the epics as
      a whole, examine whether Homer and Virgil portray interventions by the
      gods as causing more harm than good.                                        [8 marks]

      Best answers will examine a limited (because of available time) range of examples from both
      epics, for example,

      Iliad: Source A: The gods save the life of Agamemnon and secure the continuing destiny of
      the war (but is that “good”?) but frustrating Achilles from taking revenge now will set off a
      chain reaction leading to the deaths of numerous other Greeks including Patroclus.
      Elsewhere, in Book 1 Apollo sends a plague to the whole army in reaction to the insult
      to Chryses; in Book 16 Apollo ruthlessly “strikes” down Patroclus leading to his death,
      but brings Achilles back into the war to destroy Apollo’s Trojans; in Book 22 Athene cruelly
      disguises herself to trick Hector into standing his ground against Achilles, etc. But in Book 24
      Hermes’ escorting of Priam to Achilles’ hut is a good deed.

      Aeneid: Source B: Within Book 4, the gods’ intervention will have a devastating effect
      on Dido, but will secure the destiny of Rome – good for Virgil and his readers!
      Elsewhere, interventions where the gods go against fate always cause harm, e.g. in Book 1
      with Juno and Aeolus wrecking the fleet; in Book 1 and Book 4 with Venus and Cupid
      making Dido fall in love with Aeneas – but, to help destiny take its course, Jupiter via
      Mercury has already instilled a hospitable mood in the Carthaginians, and in Book 2 Venus is
      entirely benign in convincing Aeneas to leave Troy.

      Award [1–2 marks] for a response that is largely irrelevant to the question, makes little and
      inaccurate reference to details in the epics, or draws solely on Sources A and B.

      Award [3–4 marks] for a general response with some relevance to the question, and an
      adequate attempt at examination.

      Award [5–6 marks] for demonstration of a good understanding of how the gods’ interventions
      cause harm and/or good, substantiated with references and analysis.

      Award [7–8 marks] for a sophisticated response integrating both epics, offering effective
      analysis and a very good examination of both harm and good caused by divine intervention,
      and/or highlighting the differences or similarities of the treatment between epics (to a depth
      appropriate to the time frame for the question).
                                                 –6–              N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Question 2. (a) – (d) relates to Priam in the Iliad begging Achilles to return the body of Hector,
and in the Aeneid confronting Pyrrhus, Achilles’ son. The accompanying sources are Sources C and D in
the Source Booklet.

2.   (a)   With reference to Source C, demonstrate how Homer brings emotional
           intensity to this scene.                                           [6 marks]

           Best answers will refer to (a) Priam stressing how special Hector was to him over and above
           the losses in his enormous family; (b) the unbearable humiliation of kissing
           “the hands of the man who killed my son”; (c) Achilles’ sympathetic reaction leading to these
           two natural enemies weeping together; (d) Achilles’ speech expressing admiration/respect.

           Award [1–2 marks] for a generalized overview.

           Award [3–4 marks] for a balance of description and evaluation substantiated with relevant
           references to a part of Source C.

           Award [5–6 marks] for, in addition, a more in-depth examination demonstrating sensitivity to
           emotional impact, ranging across the whole extract.

     (b)   Explain how, in Source D, Virgil uses his readers’ knowledge of the Iliad to
           create this episode.                                                         [4 marks]

           Best answers will explicitly relate Priam’s words here to the plot of the Iliad Book 24,
           which confirms that Priam was indeed a “suppliant” and that Achilles was true to his word in
           allowing Priam to take Hector’s body, even persuading the Greeks to interrupt the war for
           Hector’s funeral. Use discretion on partial answers.

     (c)   Describe the impact that witnessing Priam’s death subsequently has on
           Aeneas.                                                               [2 marks]

           Award a credible response which suggests understanding beyond the content of the passage:
           (a) Aeneas’ first response is to remember his own father and the danger he has left him in.
           (b) But the desire to avenge Priam’s death overrides this when he sees Helen and runs
               forward to kill her.
                                             –7–               N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   With reference to Sources C and D, and using your knowledge of the epics as
      a whole, examine the extent to which Homer and Virgil use their epics to
      protest against the suffering caused by war.                                [8 marks]

      Best answers will confront the paradox in the question, that it is possible to have an anti-war
      war epic! Reward a reasonable, balanced selection of the numerous episodes that may
      support or contradict the title.

      Iliad: Source C: Both heroes seem overwhelmed by sufferings caused by “violent Ares”.
      Elsewhere for example, in Book 1 Achilles is an outspoken critic of the Greek war effort, its
      ignoble cause and Agamemnon’s exploitation of it for his own ends. But Homer also
      celebrates the violence of a hero’s “aristeia”, for example, in Book 22.

      Aeneid: Source D: Contains a disturbingly graphic description of the young Pyrrhus killing
      the helpless old Priam. Elsewhere for example, in Book 2 Aeneas’ first person narration of
      the destruction of his city, with the emphasis on sacrilege and cheating (the Wooden Horse),
      evokes pity for the sufferers. But in Book 12 Aeneas cannot secure the destiny of the future
      Rome without warfare – a dimension of justification for war totally lacking in the Iliad.

      Award [1–2 marks] for a response that is largely irrelevant to the question, makes little and
      inaccurate reference to details in the epics, or draws solely on Sources C and D.

      Award [3–4 marks] for a general response with some relevance to the question, and an
      adequate attempt at examination.

      Award [5–6 marks] for a demonstration of a good understanding of how both epics depict
      war as a cause of suffering, with examples.

      Award [7–8 marks] for a sophisticated response integrating both epics, offering effective
      examination and a very good understanding of the sympathy evoked for suffering caused by
      war and/or counterexamples where the warrior ethic appears to be glorified, or highlighting
      the difference in approach between epics (to a depth appropriate to the time frame for
      the question).
                                                  –8–               N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                              SECTION B

The Peloponnesian War: Greece in Conflict

Question 3. (a) – (d) relates to Pericles’ reply to the Spartan ultimatum; to Cleon undertaking to achieve
final victory at Pylos; and to further evidence from Aristophanes of hostility towards Cleon.
The accompanying sources are Sources E to G in the Source Booklet.

3.   (a)   With reference to Source E, explain Pericles’ arguments in favour of waging
           war against the Spartans.                                                   [5 marks]

           Credit a systematic explanation of Pericles’ line of argument: the relative weakness of the
           Peloponnesians stems from an agricultural economy and a lack of reserves of wealth.
           Hence a tendency to keep wars short and local (rather than invest resources in naval
           expeditions like the Athenians); and to get back to the land as quickly as possible.

           Award [1–2 marks] for arguments that are unclearly restated, with little or no effective
           explanation.

           Award [3 marks] for arguments that are clearly addressed and explained.

           Award [4–5 marks] for arguments that are clearly addressed and explained with greater
           sophistication of historical and/or cultural understanding.

     (b)   With reference to Source F, discuss how and why Thucydides conveys a
           negative attitude towards Cleon, despite the fact that the Pylos campaign was
           to be a great success.                                                        [5 marks]

           Reward an effective discussion in the candidate’s voice, that is combined with an attempt at
           interpreting Thucydides’ attitude in the context of, for example, Cleon’s tactics as a
           demagogue, his aggressive stance that put many lives at risk, and foreknowledge that though
           he did return triumphant, the prolongation of the war was ultimately disastrous for Athens.

           Award [1–2 marks] for arguments that are unclearly restated, with little or no effective
           explanation.

           Award [3 marks] for arguments that are clearly addressed and explained.

           Award [4–5 marks] for arguments that are clearly addressed and explained with greater
           sophistication of historical and/or cultural understanding.

     (c)   In what ways does Aristophanes’ satirical evidence in Source G confirm that
           there were hostile feelings in Athens towards Cleon at this time?           [2 marks]

           Reward a brief discussion of two points of confirmation (one point = [1 mark]),
           correctly interpreting the satirical language in real terms, for example Cleon is seen as a
           “boot-licker” doing everything he can to win popularity by flattery; and he takes all the credit
           for the Pylos campaign when Demosthenes was the experienced general mainly responsible
           for its success.
                                             –9–               N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   With reference to Sources E, F and G, and especially to your own knowledge,
      analyse the advantages and disadvantages to Athens of its aggressive policies
      in the Peloponnesian War.                                                     [8 marks]

      Credit should be given for a reasonable selection of aggressive policies beyond the printed
      sources, and/or the use of the sources as a springboard for deeper discussion. Best answers
      should show a good overview of the course of the war, enabling analysis of the balance between
      advantages and disadvantages. Given the time constraints, coverage of events cannot be
      exhaustive, but the highest mark cannot be achieved without referring to the Sicilian Expedition
      and the fact that Athens ultimately lost the war. Candidates should not be penalized if they
      make only limited use of one or two sources, as long as wider knowledge is secure.

      Award [1–2 marks] for a superficial discussion of the advantages, with scant attention to
      context and little evidence of understanding.

      Award [3–4 marks] for a relevant discussion, with some evidence of understanding, but with
      limited evidence of own knowledge.

      Award [5–6 marks] for evidence of a satisfactory understanding of the advantages and
      disadvantages, with some good examples from own knowledge.

      Award [7–8 marks] for, in addition, evidence of sound analysis in responding to the question,
      with an evaluation of well chosen examples from own knowledge.
                                                 – 10 –             N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Question 4. (a) – (d) relates to how Pericles prepared Athens for the outbreak of war; to how Alcibiades’
political enemies undermined his contribution to the Sicilian Expedition; and to how Plutarch
supplements Thucydides’ evidence for this event. The accompanying sources are Sources H to J in the
Source Booklet.

4.   (a)   Discuss how Source H demonstrates the political skills of Pericles, both in
           maintaining his own popularity, and in preparing Athens for war.            [6 marks]

           Credit a discussion in the candidate’s voice balancing the two aspects of the question.

           Maintaining popularity: understanding that, as an aristocrat, Pericles had aristocratic friends
           in enemy cities, and he had to prove his loyalty and solidarity with the Athenian people by
           donating his estates to the State.

           Preparing for war: for example, evacuating the countryside, avoiding a land battle,
           relying on the strength of their navy and income from allies.

           Award [1–2 marks] for arguments that are unclearly restated, with little or no effective
           evaluation.

           Award [3–4 marks] for arguments that are clearly addressed and evaluated but do not cover
           the full scope of the question.

           Award [5–6 marks] for discussions of both aspects of the question that are clearly addressed
           and evaluated with greater sophistication of historical and/or cultural understanding.

     (b)   With reference to Source I, describe the strategy of Alcibiades’ political
           enemies, and give reasons why this particular strategy was adopted.        [4 marks]

           No more than [2 marks] should be awarded for straightforward summary.

           His enemies realized that the case against him was not strong enough yet, and that he was still
           enjoying great popularity; and while he was away he would not be available to deal with new
           charges.

     (c)   Comment on how Source J, although written by Plutarch 500 years
           after these events, still provides valuable evidence for the accusations
           against Alcibiades.                                                      [2 marks]

           For [2 marks] there must be a comment about the quality of this evidence, for example,
           the point that Plutarch shows that he values primary evidence by explicitly supplementing
           Thucydides with quotes from a contemporary comic poet, Phrynichus.

           Award [1 mark] for only saying that Plutarch/Phrynichus highlights the role of “informers”
           in creating a false case against Alcibiades. Credit other valid responses.
                                             – 11 –             N12/3/CLGRS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Using information from Sources H, I and J, and especially from your own
      knowledge, analyse the extent to which the course of the Peloponnesian War
      depended on the personalities of individual politicians.                   [8 marks]

      Best answers will (a) use the sources as a basis for an evaluative discussion of the contributions
      of Pericles and Alcibiades to their respective phases of the war, and (b) show some knowledge
      and understanding of at least two other politicians, for example Cleon and Nicias. Do not
      penalize limited use of the sources if it is compensated by extensive discussion of the war
      including counterarguments, for example the effect of the Plague, the differences in political
      systems, the availability of material resources, collective morale, etc.

      Award [1–2 marks] for superficial discussion, with scant attention to context and little
      evidence of understanding.

      Award [3–4 marks] for relevantly discussed politicians, with evidence of understanding but
      with limited wider knowledge.

      Award [5–6 marks] for evidence of a satisfactory understanding of the contribution of
      politicians, and the effect of these on the war.

      Award [7–8 marks] for evidence of sound analysis and development in responding to the
      question, with an evaluation of a range of individual contributions and/or other factors that
      influenced the course of the war.
