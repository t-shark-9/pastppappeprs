Answer three questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Health and dentistry

      Many dentists have upgraded their IT systems by using a local area network (LAN). This makes it
      possible for the dental technician to take an X-ray of a patient’s teeth and for the dentist to review the
      patient’s X-rays on a monitor in another room.

      The upgraded IT system includes simulation software which allows dentists to view the predicted
      changes in the condition of a patient’s teeth over a period of time, showing the result with or
      without treatment.

      With these upgraded systems, dentists are now using electronic, instead of paper charts, for each
      patient. These charts can be updated by the dental technician on one computer while the dentist views
      them on another.

      The patient can also view their charts on a monitor. This is useful when the dentist would like to
      discuss a treatment with the patient.

(Question 1 continued)

      (a)   (i)   Describe one difference between a local area network (LAN) and a wide area
                  network (WAN).                                                                       [2]

		(ii)            The upgraded IT system is a LAN based on a client/server network. Outline the
                  relationship between the client and the server in the upgraded IT system.            [2]

            (iii) The developers of the upgraded IT system own the intellectual property rights for
                  the system. Define the term intellectual property.                                   [2]

      (b)   Analyse the impacts of implementing the upgraded IT system for the dentist.                [6]

      (c)   To what extent should dentists use simulation software to determine future treatment for
            their patients?                                                                            [8]

2.    Live-brary

      A local library has acquired a lending service called Live-brary that uses Adobe Digital Editions
      software which allows borrowers to access free digital content which can be both read online and
      downloaded to read offline. To borrow e-books from the library, borrowers need to install special
      software to download e-books on to their e-reader, smartphone, tablet or laptop.

      Borrowers create an account to register the software. Activation allows the borrower to either read
      the e-book online through streaming or read offline from the downloaded copy that is “borrowed”
      for a period of 7, 14, or 21 days. If a borrower keeps an e-book for more than the number of days
      allowed, then they must pay a fine for each day over the limit.

                           For screenshot, please refer to www.live-brary.com.




      Borrowers will need a device to access the library’s website to download the book. The books are
      available in both EPUB and PDF format. Both formats include digital rights management (DRM).

               e-books, provides to the Live-brary.                                                                       [6]

3.    Running your home from your touch-screen tablet

      Touch-screen tablet computers can be used to control items such as curtains, lighting, air conditioning,
      heating and security cameras. You can control these items when you are away from home using
      WiFi or 3G cell/mobile phone networks to access the home network.




               [Source: http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/control4-ipad-app, 18 July 2012. Used with permission.]


      Security cameras can be connected to devices on the home network by using USB cabling or WiFi.
      This makes the system flexible as you can place cameras wherever they are needed.

      To view the live feed from the home security cameras, there are several possible methods that can be
      used for secure access. One method requires a password. The other possibility is to allow automatic
      access from your specific touch-screen tablet computer.

4.    3D in the classroom

      The Abbey School in Reading, UK is using 3D projection technology for teaching biology to
      secondary (high) school students.

      The students were looking at how a chest works, via a 3D-enabled projector. The teachers and
      students wore special 3D glasses and the teacher manipulated the image around 360 degrees.

      “So cool”, “It’s huge”, “I thought the diaphragm was a flat muscle”, “I didn’t realize it wasn’t under
      the ribs” were just a few of the comments made when the girls put on their glasses to examine the
      model in more detail.

      3D technology is new in schools. 3D-ready projectors cost three times as much as 2D projectors, and
      a class set of glasses currently costs around £1500.

      To install the 3D technology, it is necessary to upgrade the network to cope with increased
      storage requirements, using a storage area network, and the increased data transfer speed required,
      by using fibre optic cables. The monitors must also have a sufficiently high specification to show the
      images clearly.

      Some manufacturers are refusing to make 3D projectors because there are no agreed standards.
      As a result, the cost of this technology is not likely to be reduced in the next few years.

      (a)   (i)   Define the term storage area network.                                                       [2]

		(ii)            State one advantage of using fibre optic cable.                                             [1]

		(iii) State one disadvantage of using fibre optic cable.                                                    [1]

		(iv) The school has bought a 5-user concurrent licence for the 3D software.
       Outline how this licence works.                                                                        [2]

      (b)   Teachers find the on-screen instructions for changing settings from 2D mode to
            3D mode very complicated and time-consuming. For example, the teacher must choose
            the following menu items each time they want to use 3D:

            Menu > Detailed Menu > Image > Advanced Menu > 3D Mode > On

            Analyse two IT methods of providing training for teachers to use the software and
            hardware linked to the new 3D system.                                                             [6]

      (c)   Other schools are investigating this 3D technology for their classrooms. Discuss whether
            they should invest in this system.                                                                [8]

5.    Voice over internet protocol (VOIP)

      Some countries ban services such as Skype, which use VOIP technology.

      Skype and other operators offering VOIP services bypass telephone networks in favour of offering
      free calls via the internet. These countries have laws that state all calls must pass through their
      national telecom companies.

      Skype has more than 500 million users worldwide and many cell/mobile phone providers now offer
      Skype services.

      Skype has been growing in popularity among individuals and businesses to make cheap or free
      international phone calls. Some governments are concerned that their national telecom companies
      will be losing income and will be unable to track conversations.

      As a result, some countries are calling for severe measures to be taken against citizens using illegal
      VOIP services.

      (a)   (i)       Identify two characteristics of VOIP.                                                          [2]

		(ii)                Define the term protocol.                                                                      [2]

		(iii) State two stages where a Skype call can be blocked from reaching the
        intended recipient.                                                                                          [2]

      (b)   Analyse the decision of some countries to ban services such as Skype.                                    [6]

      (c)   In most countries the use of VOIP is legal. Discuss the decision of a business in these
            countries to use VOIP services instead of a conventional phone system.                                   [8]
