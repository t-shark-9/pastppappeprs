uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is well
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

Independence movements

1.   Assess the political contributions of Simón Bolívar to the independence of South America.

     Many candidates may include Bolívar’s political position on the type of government necessary for
     South American countries to be successful. His belief in a republican form of government in lieu of
     a monarchical system, which was fostered by the Enlightenment influences during his educational
     training, could be a foundation for understanding his political contributions throughout the areas he
     helped to liberate. Candidates may support their view of his ideas through documents like the
     Cartagena Manifesto and the letter from Jamaica. Both documents deal with Bolívar’s view of what
     type of government was necessary for a successful transition to independence by a South American
     nation. The candidates then could apply those ideas to Bolívar’s attempts to establish a system of
     government in the areas that were liberated by his movement; Gran Colombia would be a specific
     example that may be utilized by candidates. The question asks for an assessment of these
     contributions so the answer should both describe the contributions and then determine their
     significance or value. Candidates should be clear to address the political contributions rather than
     the military contributions of Simón Bolívar when answering this question.


2.   Analyse the reasons for the issuing of the Monroe Doctrine by the United States.

     Most Latin American countries had achieved independence by the early 1820s. The US sought to
     recognize the new countries and to prevent European powers from attempting to recolonize in the
     hemisphere. US President James Monroe stated what later came to be known as the Monroe
     Doctrine in a speech to Congress in December 1823. The Doctrine stipulated that the Americas
     were to be free of foreign interference, that the United States would resist any attempt by foreign
     powers to reassert their control over any former colonies in the Americas, and that the United States
     would stay out of European affairs.

     Reasons for the establishment of the Doctrine could include: the urging of the British for the US to
     make such a proposal; the US desire to recognize and protect the independence of the new Latin
     American nations; US concern that European intervention would threaten emerging US economic
     and trade interests in Latin America; US concern over Russian interests in the Pacific Northwest;
     US awareness that the British navy would enforce the doctrine of non-intervention for the purpose
     of protecting British economic interests in Latin America and a US willingness to assert itself in
     international relations.

Nation-building and challenges

3.   With reference to one Latin American country, analyse the challenges to the establishment of
     its political system between 1800 and 1840.

     Popular choices might be Haiti, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, but accept any Latin American
     country that gained its independence during this time. Candidates could discuss the social,
     economic and political problems within the country chosen that made forming a government
     difficult. Socially these can be seen as class struggles, especially between the Peninsulars and the
     Creoles, but also between the upper classes and the majority classes of Mestizos and native peoples
     (racial disunity). Economically it could be the lack of a middle class and the wide disparity
     between the elite rich and the majority poor. Politically, candidates could mention the dispute
     between those favouring a monarchy and those wanting a republic, the differences between
     conservatives and liberals, the lack of experience in self-government which made the emergence of
     caudillos possible, and regionalism. Whichever country is chosen, candidates should show specific
     knowledge of that country’s political system, its leaders and its challenges.


4.   Discuss the effects of the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) on either Mexico or the United
     States.

     When addressing effects this could include both the time period during and after the war. Many
     candidates will address the territorial changes that occurred as a result of the war and depending on
     the nation chosen, the political, economic and social issues that were affected by this outcome.

     For Mexico the areas of discussion could include: that political control changed hands from
     moderado to puro and back to moderado based on conditions tied to the conflict; political
     instability with conflict between liberal (puros) and conservative (moderados) political parties for
     control of the country; economic loss of California and the revenue from gold found shortly after
     the end of the war; the fall in agricultural and mineral production resulting from the conscription of
     peasants; guerrilla warfare against the United States spurred peasant revolts calling for reform and
     was one of the conditions leading the moderado government to negotiate the Guadalupe Hidalgo
     Treaty which ended the conflict. The loss of territory had the impact of limiting Mexico’s potential
     as a hemispheric power. Citizenship and property rights that the treaty guaranteed to Mexican
     citizens were often ignored or violated. Politically the conditions led to the introduction of La
     Reforma and then a civil war which led to the French Intervention.

     For the United States candidates may interpret the strengthening of Manifest Destiny as a relevant
     effect of the war. Answers may address the Mexican Cession and the impact that this had on the
     sectional debate in the late 1840s and early 1850s. The debate over the expansion of slavery and
     the issues connected to that debate could be the basis for the candidates’ discussion. Examples of
     issues that could be addressed include: the Wilmot Proviso; popular sovereignty and the
     Compromise of 1850. Other effects on the US include: military experience gained by officers who
     will serve both the Union and the Confederacy during the US Civil War; US economic benefits
     from the land and resources acquired; US foreign policy within the region will be viewed with
     suspicion as representing the possibility of further expansion.

United States Civil War: causes, course and effects 1840–1877

5.   Examine the reasons for, and the effects of, President Abraham Lincoln’s decision to issue the
     Emancipation Proclamation on 1 January 1863.

     Candidates should recognize that the question is asking why the Proclamation was issued in this
     time frame and not simply why the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. In referencing the
     reasons for, answers may address legal (constitutional), political and military issues that were
     variables in the timing of the Proclamation. The lack of support for Lincoln’s plan to buy back the
     slaves, Lincoln’s desire to keep the issue out of the Supreme Court, the Confiscation Act, concern
     for the reaction of the border states, the hope that emancipation would disrupt the South’s war
     efforts and shorten the war, McClellan’s letter to Lincoln voicing his opposition to emancipation,
     the outcome of the Battle of Antietam and pressure from the Radical Republicans are all issues that
     could be discussed in regard to the timing of the Proclamation.

     When discussing effects of, answers may include: the impact on areas directly affected by the
     Proclamation in comparison to the areas not affected (particularly the border states); influence on
     slave holding states; long term impact leading to the 13th amendment; the fact that it established
     emancipation as a moral reason for fighting the war and solidified British non-intervention in the
     US Civil War.

     The question asks candidates to consider both reasons for and effects of the issuance of the
     Emancipation Proclamation.

     If only reasons or effects are considered, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


6.   ―Reconstruction was economically and socially successful for the South.‖ To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     After the Civil War, the South was devastated. Whether or not Reconstruction was successful
     economically would hinge on the rebuilding of the South. Agriculturally, the entire foundation of
     the system, slavery, was gone. It was replaced, by and large, with sharecropping and tenant
     farming, by both whites and blacks. The South re-established itself as a leading producer and
     exporter of cotton. Except in a few places, industrial growth did not make significant gains.
     Railroad construction however did. Thousands of miles of track were laid during Reconstruction,
     far surpassing pre-Civil War totals. Socially, the South underwent a massive change. Over 4
     million former slaves were now free and assimilation was a major goal of Reconstruction.
     Candidates are likely to discuss the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments as well as the
     Civil Rights Acts of 1866, 1871 and 1875 and the establishment of the Freedmen’s Bureau as
     efforts to help former slaves. The rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the Mississippi Plan with its
     Redeemers and the Black Codes did much to offset any real gains. Carpetbaggers and scalawags as
     a new element in southern society might also be mentioned.

     If only economic or social results are considered, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

The development of modern nations 1865–1929

7.   Assess the success of one Latin American leader in achieving his economic aims during the
     period 1865 to 1929.

     The answers will vary depending upon the leader chosen. There is a great deal of choice available
     for the candidates. It would be appropriate for the student to clearly state the aims of the leader and
     to clarify the criteria that will be used for assessment. Porfirio Díaz (Mexico), Hipólito Yrigoyen
     (Argentina) or José Balmaceda (Chile) are examples of individuals that might be selected by
     candidates in answering the question. Land policy, economic development, trade and foreign
     investment are just a few of the many issues that may be used to assess the administration selected
     for evaluation. Answers may address the issue of neocolonialism, dependency and modernization
     but should reflect these from the viewpoint of the Latin American leader and not a foreign investor.
     Candidates are not limited to the examples given but may use any leader or issue from the time
     frame.


8.   Examine the reasons for the movement north of large numbers of African Americans during
     the Great Migration of the early twentieth century.

     Most candidates answering this question will address the period 1910 to 1930. Valid factors
     whether positive or negative would be legitimate causes for discussion in candidate answers for this
     question. Reasons for the movement that may be addressed include: the possibility of work,
     specifically in northern factories, resulting from the labour demands of World War One; the
     opportunity for African Americans, living in the South, to experience more freedom and control
     over their lives; encouragement from relatives and friends already living in the North; programs
     initiated by northern African American newspapers, like the Chicago Defender, to motivate
     migration through stories of opportunity; the depressed economic conditions for African Americans
     in the South; racism, discrimination and acts of violence in the South.

Emergence of the Americas in global affairs 1880–1929

9.    ―Economic factors were the major reason for the expansionist foreign policy of the United
      States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.‖ To what extent was this idea
      supported by the actions of the United States government?

      Candidates may agree with or challenge this viewpoint. Answers that partially agree may address
      the issue of economic growth being a “major reason” but not the only reason. Those answers
      should then discuss economic growth and other reasons for US expansion with evidence showing
      that the government supported the stated reasons. For those answers that disagree or challenge the
      viewpoint they should give corresponding evidence showing actions by the government that support
      their position and counter the position stated as the premise of the question. It is important for the
      candidate to make a clear connection to the actions of the United States government that are used to
      support their argument concerning the major reasons for the expansionist policy and not simply to
      make an independent argument supporting a particular cause for US policy but ignoring
      government actions supporting the policy.

      Some of the reasons that may be utilized by candidates as causes for expansion other than economic
      factors could include: military and security issues such as coaling and supply stations for the
      American fleet throughout the globe, and especially the Pacific. Humanitarian concerns and the
      development of democracy could be seen in the intervention in the Philippines where the perception
      was that such intervention was for the greater good. Religious motivations such as the work of
      missionaries could also be regarded as another factor.

      Do not demand all of the above information but the answer must reflect a clear response to “to what
      extent” in order to reach the upper markbands.


10.   Discuss the reasons for, or against, the participation of one Latin American country in the
      First World War.

      Candidates should discuss only one country and should show specific knowledge about that
      country. Decisions to participate in the war revolved around economics, immigration population,
      and ties to the United States. While most Latin American countries broke relations with Germany,
      only Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama actually
      declared war, and only Brazil participated to any real extent. Most Caribbean nations had close ties,
      not necessarily willingly, to the US and followed US entry into the war. Brazil declared war in
      October 1917, mostly in reaction to Germany’s unrestricted submarine warfare, which interfered
      with Brazilian trade. Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Venezuela were officially
      neutral. Large German and Italian immigrant populations, positive trade with Central Power
      nations and/or strong anti-US feelings led to these decisions.

The Mexican Revolution 1910–1940

11.   ―The aims of Emiliano Zapata and Pancho Villa were achieved by 1920.‖ To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      This certainly will be debatable. Candidates may partially agree with the statement indicating that
      only some of the aims had been achieved by 1920. For Zapata, candidates are likely to identify the
      Zapatista slogan Tierra y Libertad and the Plan of Ayala, which indicated his desire for land reform,
      an end to the Díaz dictatorship, the establishment of democracy and equality under the law. His
      accomplishments could be overthrowing Díaz and helping Madero gain power by controlling
      southern states, defeating Huerta by allying with Villa, and instituting land reform in areas under his
      control. Candidates might also add that his aim for national land reform was partially realized in
      the Constitution of 1917, though not implemented until post-1920.

      Villa’s aims also included land reform and the ending of the Díaz government, but candidates could
      add his desire for protecting workers’ rights and educational reform. For his achievements
      candidates could identify his control of Chihuahua and enactment of reforms, and the ousting of
      Huerta. Candidates might also add that his aims were at least partially realized in the Constitution
      of 1917, but not carried out until the mid-1920s.


12.   In what ways, and with what results, did Lázaro Cárdenas attempt to renew the Mexican
      Revolution during his presidency?

      In answering this question, candidates need to address both parts of the question. In discussing the
      ways that Cárdenas attempted to renew the Revolution areas that might be included are land reform
      policy, labour reform, the nationalization of the oil industry and educational reform. Candidates
      could make direct connections between these reforms and Articles 3, 27 and 123 of the Constitution
      of 1917.

      The results that might be discussed include large amounts of land distributed to landless peasants,
      including the redevelopment of the ejidos, the establishment of the CTM and its replacement of
      CROM, the creation of PEMEX, a government corporation that would administer public lands and
      oil contracts, and increased educational funding and prominence.

      The question asks candidates to consider both “ways” and “results”.

      If only ways or results are considered, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

The Great Depression and the Americas 1929–1939

13.   Analyse the response of one country in Latin America to the Great Depression.

      Any one country in the region can be chosen. Many will choose Brazil. After the collapse of
      coffee prices and the valorization program that supported it, Brazil was hit especially hard by the
      Depression. Vargas initially responded with government programmes similar to FDR’s New Deal.
      These included government spending, economic reforms and social welfare programs. He also
      promoted growth through import substitution industrialization, high protective tariffs and foreign
      investment. He nationalized railroads and shipping companies. These populist and nationalistic
      endeavours improved Brazil’s economy, but did not end the Depression. In 1937, Vargas took a
      more fascist approach by establishing the Estado Novo. Minimum wage laws and labour standards
      were set. Electrification of the countryside was promoted and the steel industry experienced
      growth. For effects, candidates could argue that Vargas’ response to the Depression increased the
      power of the federal government, promoted centralization and the rise of Rio de Janeiro, decreased
      the political strength of the coffee growers and created strong nationalistic feelings. There are a
      number of methods that Latin American governments used in their attempt to solve the economic
      problems presented by the Great Depression. Those included Import Substitution Industrialization
      (ISI), increased government regulation and increasing their economic relationship with the more
      industrialized nations. In a number of the countries there would be some combination of these
      methods with economic nationalism being promoted by many of the governments. Brazil’s Estado
      Novo, Argentina’s Roca-Runciman Pact and Chile’s Production Development Corporation
      (CORFO) are actions that indicate an attempt by these nations to address the economic issues
      brought about by the Depression. Latin America also saw the rise of strong leaders who were
      responsible for implementing these programmes. Getúlio Vargas in Brazil, Agustín Pedro Justo in
      Argentina, Pedro Aguirre Cerda in Chile and Lázaro Cárdenas in Mexico are examples of
      individuals that took action directed at solving the problems of the Great Depression. Like many
      countries, the end of the Great Depression was brought about more by the Second World War than
      by all of the domestic economic programmes.

14.   ―Even though the New Deal programmes of Franklin D Roosevelt were massive in their size
      they did not effectively solve the economic problems created by the Great Depression in the
      United States.‖ To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      In order to answer the question, candidates will address the efficacy of the New Deal and its
      programmes in solving the economic problems of the Great Depression. Answers may state that
      they agree to some extent by indicating that many of the economic problems were not solved but
      that in some cases, specific programmes were effective in addressing the economic problems that
      they were designed to correct. The candidates may use any of the New Deal agencies in their
      answer but should provide specific details in support of the position that they have taken. Agencies
      like the TVA, CCC, WPA, AAA, NRA, FDIC and HOLC may be used to show government's
      response to the economic needs of the public. It will be important for the answer to include the
      results of these programmes to show their effect in order to fully address the question asked.
      Candidates may agree fully with the viewpoint and may indicate that the problems of the Great
      Depression were “solved” by the economic requirements of the Second World War. This position
      is valid but if the candidate argues this rationale they still must include a discussion of the
      ineffectiveness of the New Deal programmes to fully address the question. The recession of 1937
      and the persistence of high unemployment could be used to support this position.

      Do not demand all of the above information but the answer must reflect a clear response to “to what
      extent” in order to reach the upper markbands.

The Second World War and the Americas 1933–1945

15.   In what ways, and with what effects, did Franklin D Roosevelt apply the Good Neighbour
      policy towards Latin America?

      Candidates might begin by defining the Good Neighbour policy as explained in FDR’s inaugural
      address. Some might even add that the policy actually began during the Hoover administration.
      The policy was applied financially, culturally and politically. The US initiated bilateral trade
      agreements with several Latin American countries during the 1930s in hopes of improving trade.
      An export–import bank was created to facilitate such trade. When American oil companies were
      nationalized in Bolivia in 1937 and Mexico in 1938, FDR pursued negotiations rather than
      intervention. Culturally, many educational and scientific exchanges took place. Politically, the US
      rejected the idea of unilateral intervention at the Montevideo Conference in 1933 and the Buenos
      Aires Conference (attended by FDR) in 1936. The US ended the Platt Amendment towards Cuba
      and completed the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and Nicaragua. Candidates are likely to make
      reference to the programme’s positive effects such as better relations, improved image for the US
      and hemispheric cooperation in the Second World War. Some candidates might argue that changes
      brought about by the policy were superficial and did little to alter the regional dominance of the US.

      If only ways or effects are considered, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


16.   Discuss the impact of the inter-American diplomacy of one country in the Americas prior to
      and during the Second World War.

      Candidates may select any country in the Americas; choices might include United States, Brazil,
      Canada, Chile or Mexico. Regardless of the country chosen, candidates must address hemispheric
      diplomatic policies as opposed to policies directed toward Europe and/or Asia. Inter-American
      defence and hemispheric security were major issues in the late 1930s and continued throughout the
      war. The discussion could include the meetings of foreign ministers: in Buenos Aires (1936) where
      they signed an agreement to submit conflicts to mediation; in Lima (1938) where they signed a
      declaration of unity; in Panama (1939) to address the outbreak of the war and declare a “neutrality
      zone” around the continent, and in Havana (1940) where French and Dutch colonies were put under
      inter-American protection for defence purposes. In addressing these meetings a priority should be
      given to the impact on the country whose diplomatic policies are being considered.

      Examples that could be discussed include: Brazil’s arrangement to allow a US base at Natal in
      return for help in establishing the steel plant Volta Redonda which established a foundation for the
      Brazilian steel industry, the hosting of the Rio de Janeiro meeting presenting a committed front
      against the Axis in the Americas, the “Battle for Rubber” in the Amazon and the arrangements with
      the United States for a Brazilian Expeditionary Force which fought in Europe; Mexico’s agreements
      with the United States to provide material for the war effort in exchange for investment and the
      modernization of industry, a joint defence arrangement with the US who provided Mexico with
      ships for patrolling the coast, the Escuadrón 201 which served with the US Army Air Corps in the
      Pacific and the agreement to allow Mexican labourers to come into the US to work in factories
      replacing individuals who had gone to war. The examples will vary depending upon the nation
      selected.

Political developments in the Americas after the Second World War 1945–1979

17.   How successful were the domestic policies of Canadian prime minister Diefenbaker?

      John Diefenbaker, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, was prime minister from
      1957 to 1963, first with a minority government, then with an overwhelming majority government
      after the 1958 elections, and finally with a minority government after losses in the 1962 election.
      Candidates are likely to identify some of the following policies: increasing retirement pensions,
      tax cuts, pay raises for federal employees, price supports for farmers, promoting wheat sales to
      China and the cancellation of the Avro Arrow jet. In line with his vision of One Canada,
      Diefenbaker secured passage of the Bill of Rights for all Canadians, enfranchised the First Nations,
      and refused any compromises with the Quiet Revolution in Quebec. In responding to the prompt
      candidates should provide a detailed examination of Diefenbaker’s domestic programme and a
      critical review of the degree of success achieved through the implementation of specific policies.


18.   Compare and contrast the rise to power of two populist leaders in Latin America between
      1945 and 1979.

      Examples that might be used by candidates include Juan Perón, Rómulo Betancourt, Victor Paz
      Estenssoro and José Figueres Ferrer. If a candidate uses Getúlio Vargas it must clearly be his rise
      to power for the second time during the 1950 election. Since Fidel Castro represents some of the
      elements of a populist leader, he should be accepted as a valid example. The existing conditions,
      methods employed, ideology followed and supporters used to achieve power are examples of
      categories for comparison that could be utilized for this essay.

      In answering the question both similarities and differences should be addressed and the best
      answers will do so in a running comparison with direct linkage.

      If only one leader is considered, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

The Cold War and the Americas 1945–1981

19.   To what extent was Eisenhower’s New Look foreign policy a departure from the foreign
      policy of Truman?

      Candidates are likely to agree that the New Look foreign policy was different, but may disagree on
      how much of a change it really was. Containment was still the foundation of US foreign policy.
      Truman’s response to perceived communist aggression was to challenge it at specific sites (Berlin
      and Korea) with conventional weapons. New Look emphasized changing US response from being
      reactive to aggression to creating options of when, how and against whom to take actions. New
      Look attempted to use US nuclear superiority and covert operations to achieve foreign policy
      objectives. While the “roll back” of communism was a frequently expressed ideal, the Eisenhower
      Administration was cautious to actually implement this aim. The policy of threatening to use
      nuclear retaliation was known as brinkmanship. Candidates may argue that the change was only in
      rhetoric, and that it was short lived. By 1957, the US was committing conventional forces to the
      Middle East.

      If only Eisenhower’s policy is discussed, with no reference to Truman’s policy, mark out of a
      maximum of [12 marks].


20.   Compare and contrast the nature of the United States’ involvement in Vietnam during two
      presidencies from 1954 to 1973.

      The dates of the question allow for discussions of Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon.
      Comparisons of Johnson and Nixon are most likely, but any of the four are acceptable. Regardless
      of which presidents are chosen, candidates are likely to compare them as continuing US
      involvement based on the containment policy and the domino theory. Differences could be in the
      level of involvement and in the strategies employed. Comparison and contrast of the changing
      strategies and their effectiveness could be a means through which candidates apply analysis. After
      the Geneva Conference on Indochina the Eisenhower administration supported South Vietnam
      financially and with military advisors. Kennedy continued that support, though perhaps with some
      misgivings. Kennedy greatly increased the number of military advisors, implemented the Strategic
      Hamlet policy, and witnessed the overthrow of Diem. Johnson secured passage of the Gulf of
      Tonkin Resolution in August, 1964, sent in combat troops in March, 1965 and began the process
      known as the Americanization of the war, which included Operation Rolling Thunder. After the
      Tet Offensive, Johnson entered into peace talks. In 1969, Nixon unveiled his secret plan for ending
      the war by implementing the Vietnamization of the war and yet, at the same time, expanding the
      war into neighbouring countries and bombing North Vietnam.

      Candidates may delve into the growth of the antiwar movement in America, but that is only
      marginal to the question and should not be rewarded.

      If only one president is considered, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

Civil rights and social movements in the Americas

21.   Compare and contrast the tactics used by two organizations within the Civil Rights Movement
      to end segregation in the South between 1955 and 1965.

      There are a number of organizations within the Civil Rights Movement that could be selected by the
      candidates. The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP), the
      Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
      Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) are examples of major
      organizations that were a part of the Civil Rights Movement and may be used in answering this
      question. Goals, strategies, methods, tactics and their effectiveness (or not), and leadership style are
      all examples of categories that could be used in developing a compare and contrast essay on this
      question. The question’s time parameters are very clear and candidates need to stay within that
      timeframe.

      In answering the question both similarities and differences should be addressed and the best
      answers will do so in a running comparison with direct linkage.

      If only one organization is considered, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


22.   Assess the success of feminist movements in one country in the Americas.

      Answers will vary according to the country chosen. The United States, Canada and Argentina are
      likely choices, but accept any other country chosen. In most cases, candidates could suggest that
      feminist movements were successful in improving women’s social, political and economic status.
      This can be seen in increased college enrollments, more women elected to political office and
      greater job opportunities and promotions. Examples of specific legislation benefiting women could
      be cited. Candidates might also argue that while some success has occurred, women still receive
      lower average pay, make up the majority of those at poverty level, and may lack full recognition of
      their civil rights.

      Candidates should be rewarded for specific knowledge of the selected country.                    Broad
      generalizations would be limited in the marks that could be awarded.

      Since no timeframe is specified, remain open to any legitimate application of a feminist movement
      from any era within the history of the region. Remain open to a broad definition of what constituted
      a feminist movement even if the movement addressed only particular issues (i.e. Eva Perón and
      political rights in Argentina; Madres de Plaza de Mayo).

Into the twenty-first century — from the 1980s to 2000

23.   Evaluate the economic effects of globalization on one country in the Americas up to 2000.

      Candidates are to select a country in the Americas and use specific examples from that country in
      order to evaluate the effects of globalization. Free trade, trade agreements, immigration, tariff
      policies, outsourcing, labour issues and specialization are topics that could be addressed by
      candidates in the essay. Examples of trade integration that may be included as part of the
      discussion on globalization are the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mercosur,
      the Andean Pact, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the Central American Common
      Market. Although social and political effects may be discussed as they relate to economic effects
      they should not be the focus of the essay.

      Both the regional option description and the topic itself end the time frame at 2000. Answers that
      contain a large amount of material past 2000 will be limited in the marks that can be awarded.


24.   In what ways, and with what effects, have environmental concerns been addressed by one
      country in the Americas up to 2000?

      Answers will vary according to the country chosen. Likely choices could be Argentina, Brazil,
      Canada and the United States. Environmental concerns could include global warming,
      deforestation, air and water pollution, waste disposal and biodiversity, but any relevant examples
      are acceptable. For “what ways”, candidates could identify specific legislation, international
      treaties and actions taken. “Effects” will vary based on country chosen and concerns addressed.

      This type of broad question allows much latitude for the candidate in selecting material for their
      answer. However candidates are expected to show specific knowledge for the country selected.

      Both the regional option description and the topic itself end the time frame at 2000. Answers that
      contain a large amount of material past 2000 will be limited in the marks that can be awarded.

      If only ways or effects are considered, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
