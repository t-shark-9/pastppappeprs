Question 1. (a) – (d) relates to Athene intervening to stop Achilles killing Agamemnon and to
Mercury intervening to stop Aeneas staying with Dido. The accompanying sources are Sources A and B
in the Source Booklet.

1.    (a)   Using details from Source A, explain how Homer demonstrates the special
            relationship between Achilles and the gods.                             [5 marks]

      (b)   Analyse the importance of Source B as a turning point in the plot of the Aeneid.    [3 marks]

      (c)   With reference to Source A and Source B, compare and contrast the reactions of the
            two heroes to these sudden appearances by the gods.                                [4 marks]

      (d)   With reference to Sources A and B, and using your knowledge of the epics as
            a whole, examine whether Homer and Virgil portray interventions by the gods as
            causing more harm than good.                                                   [8 marks]

Question 2. (a) – (d) relates to Priam in the Iliad begging Achilles to return the body of Hector,
and in the Aeneid confronting Pyrrhus, Achilles’ son. The accompanying sources are Sources C and D in
the Source Booklet.

2.    (a)   With reference to Source C, demonstrate how Homer brings emotional intensity to
            this scene.                                                                     [6 marks]

      (b)   Explain how, in Source D, Virgil uses his readers’ knowledge of the Iliad to create
            this episode.                                                                       [4 marks]

      (d)   With reference to Sources C and D, and using your knowledge of the epics as

            against the suffering caused by war.                                             [8 marks]

The Peloponnesian War: Greece in Conflict

Question 3. (a) – (d) relates to Pericles’ reply to the Spartan ultimatum; to Cleon undertaking to
achieve final victory at Pylos; and to further evidence from Aristophanes of hostility towards Cleon.
The accompanying sources are Sources E to G in the Source Booklet.

3.    (a)   With reference to Source E, explain Pericles’ arguments in favour of waging war
            against the Spartans.                                                           [5 marks]

      (b)   With reference to Source F, discuss how and why Thucydides conveys a
            negative attitude towards Cleon, despite the fact that the Pylos campaign was to be
            a great success.                                                                    [5 marks]

      (c)   In what ways does Aristophanes’ satirical evidence in Source G confirm that there
            were hostile feelings in Athens towards Cleon at this time?                       [2 marks]

      (d)   With reference to Sources E, F and G, and especially to your own knowledge,
            analyse the advantages and disadvantages to Athens of its aggressive policies in the

Question 4. (a) – (d) relates to how Pericles prepared Athens for the outbreak of war; to how
Alcibiades’ political enemies undermined his contribution to the Sicilian Expedition; and to how Plutarch
supplements Thucydides’ evidence for this event. The accompanying sources are Sources H to J in the
Source Booklet.

4.    (a)   Discuss how Source H demonstrates the political skills of Pericles, both in
            maintaining his own popularity, and in preparing Athens for war.            [6 marks]

      (b)   With reference to Source I, describe the strategy of Alcibiades’ political enemies,
            and give reasons why this particular strategy was adopted.                          [4 marks]

      (c)   Comment on how Source J, although written by Plutarch 500 years after these
            events, still provides valuable evidence for the accusations against Alcibiades. [2 marks]

      (d)   Using information from Sources H, I and J, and especially from your own
            knowledge, analyse the extent to which the course of the Peloponnesian War
            depended on the personalities of individual politicians.                   [8 marks]
