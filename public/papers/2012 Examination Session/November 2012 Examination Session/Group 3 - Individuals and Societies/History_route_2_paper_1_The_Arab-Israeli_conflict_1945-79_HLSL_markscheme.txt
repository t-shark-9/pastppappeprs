work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source A, was Gromyko’s reaction to Camp David
           and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement?                         [3 marks]

            Gromyko does not believe that anything has been resolved by the agreement and that
             it could lead to more tension & a new conflict in the area;
            He does not believe that it will result in a durable peace in the Middle East;
            He states that the Soviet Union sides firmly with the Arab peoples in their rejection
             of the Peace Agreement which ignores the rights of the Palestinian Arabs;
            Gromyko believed that an influential factor in the deal between Egypt & Israel
             was oil.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                     [2 marks]

            The Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement is very fragile & precariously balanced
             (Carter is standing on one leg);
            The Peace Agreement is dependent on money and the role of the US (symbolized by
             the dollar signs and President Carter) to hold it together;
            Peace (symbolized by the dove) is threatened by the explosiveness of the situation in
             the Middle East (symbolized by the bomb);
            The facial expressions of the three protagonists suggest that neither Sadat nor Begin
             are happy with the Agreement (their frowns), whereas Carter‟s grin suggests his
             enthusiasm for the Peace Agreement.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about Camp
     David and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement.                                    [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources mention the devastating effects that Camp David and the Egyptian-Israeli
       Peace Agreement had on relations between Arab states;
      Both sources speak of the Arabs‟ belief that Sadat betrayed the Arab cause by signing a
       peace treaty, as shown by Egypt‟s suspension from the Arab League;
      Both sources indicate that Camp David & the Peace Agreement marked a significant break
       with the past (C – shock to the Arab world, D – Sadat breaking Arab taboo);
      Both sources suggest that Egypt‟s agreement with Israel was not followed through by the
       other Arab states.

     For “contrast”
      Source C views Camp David and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement as worsening the
       existing conditions in the Arab world whereas Source D sees them as a clear attempt to
       achieve peace;
      Source C deals more with events in the Arab World in general in 1978 and 1979 whereas
       Source D focuses primarily on the Camp David Accords and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace
       Agreements and their consequences for Egypt and Israel;
      Source C states that it was the Islamic Revolution in Iran as well as the Peace Agreement
       between Egypt & Israel that had a deep impact on the Arab world. On the other hand
       Source D indicates that the Peace Agreement was the sole contributory factor to the rift in
       the Arab world.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources
     are used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum
     of [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source B for historians studying Camp David and the
     Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement.                                                     [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        An extract from a speech by Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister,
                    given at the United Nations General Assembly, 25 September 1979.

     Purpose:       To state the policy of the Soviet Union in regard to the situation in the Middle
                    East in 1979. To criticize Camp David and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace
                    Agreement and to persuade world opinion to adopt such a hostile view.

     Value:         Gromyko‟s status as a leading Soviet politician means that this source provides
                    a reliable insight into the officially stated attitude of the Soviet Union to the
                    Middle East situation in 1979, with its support for the Arab peoples.

     Limitations:   It is a speech to the United Nations and as such is intended to show Soviet
                    policy at the height of the Cold War. It could be seen as pro-Arab Soviet
                    propaganda as the United States was perceived as being pro-Israeli at this time.
                    The timing of Gromyko‟s speech means that it cannot give any indication
                    either of the subsequent application of the Soviet view, nor can it tell us about
                    the speech‟s possible impact on world opinion.

     Source B
     Origin:        Extract from the book Palestine: Peace not Apartheid by Jimmy Carter, a
                    former US President, 2007.

     Purpose:       To reflect on the success of Camp David and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace
                    Agreement thirty years later on. To criticize Israeli policy in the Middle East.
                    To show what happened after Camp David & the Peace Agreement. To
                    provide his (Carter‟s) personal recollections & possibly to vindicate his own
                    role in relation to Camp David & the Peace Agreement.

     Value:         As someone who was directly involved in the negotiations Carter has good
                    insights into the two main participants, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin. It
                    was written with hindsight and is reassessing the effectiveness of the
                    Agreements. The fact that Carter is critical of the arrangements that he helped
                    to achieve suggests a commendable & valuable determination to provide a
                    balanced view.

     Limitations:   This is Carter‟s own opinion, so it is likely that he will be seeking to exonerate
                    himself from Camp David‟s and the Peace Agreement‟s limited success. Also
                    the title of the book „Palestine: Peace not Apartheid‟ suggests a biased and
                    subjective view.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.
                                              –6–             N12/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S2/M



4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the significance of the
     Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement and events in the Middle East for Israel
     and the Arab World up to the end of 1979.                                           [8 marks]

     Source A:     This source indicates that the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement will resolve
                   nothing and could aggravate the situation in the Middle East. It shows that the
                   Soviet Union sides with the Arab peoples. The Agreement‟s significance for
                   peace has been overstated because of its failure to address a key aspect of the
                   Middle East – the deprivation of the Palestinian people from their land..

     Source B:     This source shows that the Arab World imposed sanctions on Egypt who
                   became isolated. It maintains that the Agreement was significant for Israel as it
                   felt more secure as Egypt would not be a part of any military action against it,
                   & this made Israel more confident in settling & fortifying the occupied
                   territories, thus aggravating the situation. It shows that Begin only had a
                   genuine interest in peace with Egypt – he did not take his promises seriously
                   regarding the West Bank & the Palestinians. However, it also shows that Israel
                   felt that it might be threatened by other Arab groups in the future.

     Source C:     This source describes the breakdown of Arab unity. It also identifies key
                   events in 1979 such as Egypt‟s suspension from the Arab League, the fall of
                   the Shah and the Islamic Revolution in Iran which are significant in their
                   effects on international relations in the area.

     Source D:     The Peace Agreement marked a breakthrough – it broke the Arab taboo on
                   doing a deal with Israel. However both Sadat & Begin were mainly interested
                   in a bilateral agreement. This they strictly applied, but they neglected the
                   second strand of Camp David which dealt with a resolution of Israel‟s dispute
                   with the Palestinians & with other Arab states. Also the condemnation of Sadat
                   by most Arab states & Egypt‟s suspension from the Arab League made the
                   prospects for a comprehensive settlement less likely.

     Source E:     This source indicates the instability of the whole situation and the fragility of
                   the peace settlement as it depended on maintaining a fragile balance between
                   the Egyptians and the Israelis. It also shows the importance of the role of the
                   US in helping to keep this balance and the provision of US financial support in
                   the region as a result of the Agreement.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: more details about the Iranian Revolution and the accession to
     power of the Ayatollah Khomeini in early 1979 with the establishment of an Islamic Republic
     in April and its effects on the region. Candidates could also include more details about the
     terms of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement and its implementation. Israel did begin to
     withdraw from the Sinai in May 1979. Begin received popular support from some Israelis but
     faced intense opposition from the settlers and from some factions in the Knesset – Dayan
     resigned as Foreign Secretary in October. The Arab League moved its headquarters from
     Cairo to Tunis and the PLO became more active after suspending diplomatic relations
     with Egypt. The US began to provide large amounts of aid to Egypt but was shocked by
     the Teheran “hostage crisis” in November.
                                         –7–             N12/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S2/M


N.B. Some candidates might include the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (technically outside
the Middle East although there is some debate here) and this is in order providing that they
ensure that the significance of this invasion relates explicitly to Middle Eastern affairs.
Similarly, some candidates might mention the assassination of Sadat in 1981 as significant as
it was a consequence of the Peace Agreement. This is outside the time span of the Prescribed
Subject but candidates may use it to show the significance of the opposition of some Egyptian
groups to the Peace Agreement.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
[8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
references to the sources used.
