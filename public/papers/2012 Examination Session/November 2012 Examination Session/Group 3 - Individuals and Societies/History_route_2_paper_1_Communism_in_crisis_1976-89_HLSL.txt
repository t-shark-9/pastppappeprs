SOURCE A                 Extract from Berlin Rising: the Biography of a City by Anthony Read and David
                         Fisher, 1994. Anthony Read and David Fisher are British television writers who
                         have collaborated on a number of historical books.

On 7 November the DDR government resigned. On 8 November the entire politburo followed.
The next day a new politburo was appointed. At its first meeting they decided to listen to the pleas from
the Czech government to stem the flow of refugees, which was causing chaos. One answer would be to
issue passports to all East Germans who wanted them, which should stop the immediate rush and allow time
to think.

During his press conference, after announcing new appointments, Schabowski, the Berlin party chief,
was asked about travel arrangements. Almost without thinking, he reported the decision to issue
passports and travel permits on demand. When asked when the regulation would come into force,
he replied, “Immediately”. East Berliners took Schabowski at his word. His announcement was broadcast
on television and radio. Within minutes thousands were hurrying to the nearest checkpoint demanding
to be let through. The border guards had received no orders, and did not know what to do. They tried
turning people away, but as crowds built up they gave up. Some guards had heard the radio and decided it
must be true. One by one, barriers were raised. The Cold War ended almost by accident.

SOURCE B                 Extract from Why Did Communism Collapse in 1989?, a research paper by
                         Charles S Maier, January 1991. Charles S Maier is currently Professor of
                         History, Harvard University and was Director of the Minda de Gunzburg Center
                         for European Studies 1994–2001. The Minda de Gunzburg Center’s governing
                         committees represent the major social science departments at Harvard University
                         and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA.

Economic difficulties of the 1970s posed harsh alternatives for East and West. With social conflict and
confusion over policy, the West opted for the discipline of the world market. The East retreated from
economic reforms. Looking back we can see the collapse of 1989 in that difference. Through the
1950s and 1960s Eastern and Western Europe enjoyed comparable growth rates. Socialism and capitalism
responded to opportunities and demands of recovery from war. The West remained ahead of the East,
but it started from a stronger position. It benefited from the undamaged economy of the United States.
East Germany had to serve as the major source of Soviet reparations until 1950; thereafter the Russians
exploited their domination to draw industrial goods from their satellites through favourable trading devices
imposed through COMECON.

                       Reconciliation with a Traumatic Past by Dragoş Petrescu, 2008. Dragoş Petrescu
                       is Lecturer in Comparative Politics and Recent History in the Department of
                       Political Science, University of Bucharest. He is a member of the National Council
                       for the Study of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS), Bucharest and a Member of the
                       Advisory Presidential Commission for the Analysis of the Communist Dictatorship
                       in Romania.

The coming to power of Gorbachev and his domestic perestroika had an immense impact on the Communist
regimes of Eastern Europe. The Soviet policy of non-intervention during 1989 contributed enormously to
the collapse of Communist regimes. After 1968 relations between the USSR and the Sovietized countries
were dominated by the Brezhnev Doctrine, asserting that the USSR could intervene in any country in
which the communist government was threatened. Under Gorbachev the Sinatra Doctrine stated that every
country must decide for itself the path to be pursued.

The collapse of Communist regimes cannot be discussed separately from events in neighbouring countries.
The “snowball” effect had a decisive role on public opinion. The snowball started in Poland. In Hungary,
the regime was influenced by the Polish Round Table Talks of February–April 1989.


SOURCE D               Extract from Rebirth of a Nation: Anatomy of Russia by John Lloyd, 1998. John
                       Lloyd was associate editor of New Statesman, a British political and cultural
                       magazine, and former Moscow correspondent of the Financial Times, UK.

Gorbachev had taken on four vast tasks, which no one could have achieved totally. These were:
effect fundamental change in Soviet foreign policy; sweeping economic reform; political liberalization
and glasnost; the renewal of relations between the centre and republics/localities. He had poor advice
about these, with the partial exception of foreign policy.

He never seemed to grasp that once he started to remove such foundation stones as terror, untouchability
of the party, iron unity of the Union, he could not stop the resulting avalanche once it had been allowed
to gather momentum. He did not seem conscious that, in encouraging autonomous [independent] action,
free expression and initiative from below, he was threatening not just the Communist legacy but the
Russian one.
