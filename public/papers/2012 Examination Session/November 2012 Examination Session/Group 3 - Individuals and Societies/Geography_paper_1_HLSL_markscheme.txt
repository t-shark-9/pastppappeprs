                                 Core Theme – Patterns and Change

                                             SECTION A

1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Describe the pattern of internal migration shown on the map.                      [3 marks]

           Any of the following statements for [1 mark] each:
           • the majority of migrants move to South/South-East
           • little/limited movement to West
           • majority of movement is to the coast
           • movement is from provinces with low HDI to high HDI.

           One of the statements must refer to data values in the key for [1 mark].

           Credit other valid descriptions that refer only to information found on the map
           (i.e. “rural to urban” is not valid).

     (b)   Briefly explain three positive socio-economic impacts that this migration
           could have for the provinces of destination.                             [2+2+2 marks]

           Impacts must be of a socio-economic nature and must be framed as positive.

           •   Increased labour force – surplus of cheap labour for industry
           •   Increased consumer market – stimulates economy of area
           •   More investment by government – improved infrastructure and services
           •   Arrival of “others” – stimulates rich cultural diversity
           •   Female migrants – increased incidence of marriage (Chinese context)

           Award [1 mark] for each stated impact and [1 mark] for explanation.

     (c)   Explain why an imbalance in the birth ratio exists in some societies.             [4 marks]

           Answers should show an understanding of birth ratio – stated or implied
           [1 mark] and then identify a relevant example of where the birth ratio is
           unbalanced for example, China, Taiwan, India, South Korea [1 mark].

           The following [1+1 marks] is for any two valid explanations:
           • sex-selective abortions can result in a much more extreme birth ratio
           • ultrasound technology has made sex selection possible
           • boys favoured to carry on the family name, avoid paying a dowry etc.
           • unreported births / female infanticide could skew official data.

2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   (i)     State which region has met its target.                                           [1 mark]

                   East Asia and Pacific.

           (ii)    Identify the year when this region first met its target.                         [1 mark]

                   Accept any year in the range 1998–2000.

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why some regions may not meet their 2015 target.                  [2+2 marks]

           •     Population growth outstripping resources/progress
           •     Corruption / misappropriation of taxes/loans
           •     Global recession may mean less aid/funds available in some regions
           •     External debt, diverts money which could be used for development
           •     War/conflict (internal/civil or external) can reverse progress made
           •     Natural disasters for example, earthquake in Haiti.

           There are other possibilities. Do not credit gross generalizations such as
           people being uneducated. Reference would need to be made to lack of formal
           educational opportunities and how this impacts upon targets.

           Two distinct reasons that are linked to the target of reducing the number
           living on less than a dollar a day need to be stated and developed.

     (c)   Explain how increased trade and market access can sometimes help
           reduce disparities between countries.                                                    [5 marks]

           Responses should demonstrate knowledge and understanding of what increased
           trade and market access means for [1 mark]. Possible explanations could focus
           on removal of tariff barriers, free ports, fair trade, reduced protectionism and/or
           trading blocs [I mark].
           The rest of the response should look at how this increased access helps to
           reduce disparities [3 marks].
           Award [1 mark] for each basic explanation, with additional marks for
           extension and exemplification.

           For example: China joining the WTO and opening up its economy has allowed
           it to become “the workshop of the world” and increase its prosperity.

           Candidates may note the “sometimes” and should be credited for explanations
           that show how increased trade and market access can increase disparities.

3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Identify the two most cost-effective options shown on the graph.                   [2 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for stratospheric sunshade and [1 mark] for afforestation.

     (b)   Explain how deforestation may contribute to global warming.                        [3 marks]

           Deforestation – burning of forests releasing CO2 / removes a valuable carbon
           sink [1 mark]
           Increases CO2 in the atmosphere [1 mark]
           CO2 is a greenhouse gas linked to global warming, through its role in helping
           raise the quantity of heat energy retained by the atmosphere [1 mark].

           Credit should be given in a similar fashion to answers that refer to
           deforestation resulting in changed albedo.

           The answer needs to focus on the loss of the trees – not on what replaces the
           trees for example, cattle ranching and methane.

     (c)   Explain two possible environmental consequences of global climate
           change.                                                           [3+3 marks]

           The consequences may be at any scale and there are many possible answers.

           Possible consequences include:
           •     rising sea levels [1 mark] due to thermal expansion [1 mark] floods
              lowlands [1 mark]
           •     melting ice / Earth’s albedo reduced/increased intake of solar radiation /
              warms climate further
           •     increased temperature of oceans / greater incidence of tropical storms /
              devastation caused by hurricane Sandy in Haiti, Cuba
           •     melting ice releasing freshwater into N Atlantic / shuts down ocean / may
              lead to falling temperatures in Europe.

           Other possibilities: extinctions, moving biomes, bleaching of coral reefs,
           desertification, etc.

           In each case, award [1 mark] for identifying a valid consequence with a further
           [2 marks] for two distinct points in the explanation, one of which could be
           exemplification.

4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   Define ecological footprint.                                                      [2 marks]

           An ecological footprint is the theoretical measurement of the amount of land
           and water a population requires to produce the resources it consumes [1 mark]
           and to absorb its waste under prevailing technology [1 mark].

     (b)   Describe how the pattern of ecological footprints shown by the graph
           reflects economic development.                                                    [2 marks]

           The relationship is that countries with higher economic development have
           larger footprints [1 mark]. Award a further [1 mark] for quantification.

     (c)   (i)    Outline a strategy at a local or national scale which is designed to
                  reduce the consumption of one named resource.                              [2 marks]

                  The strategy may involve resource substitution, conservation, recycling
                  or waste reduction. Award [1 mark] for a valid, located strategy.
                  Award a further [1 mark] for explaining how this reduces consumption.
                  If no resource is named, no credit can be given.

           (ii)   Explain two reasons why the strategy described in (c)(i) either has or
                  has not been a success.                                                [2+2 marks]

                  There are many possible reasons. Award [1 mark] for identifying each
                  valid reason, with a further [1 mark] for explanation. Award a maximum
                  of [2 marks] in the event that the strategy is not clearly linked to the
                  response given in (c)(i).
                                                    –7–               N12/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               SECTION B

5.   “Environmental sustainability will never be achieved without population
     control.” Discuss this statement.                                                             [15 marks]

     There are many possible approaches to this question.

     “Environmental sustainability” is treating the environment in such a way that it
     meets the needs of the present generation without limiting the ability of future
     generations to meet their own needs. It includes not only a concern for resource use
     (for example, preferring renewable resources to non-renewable resources) but also a
     determination to avoid contamination (soil, water, air) and to prevent adverse
     human-induced impacts on the environment.

     Population control is not limited to policies designed to limit birth rates, but may also
     be interpreted to include policies of migration, and even policies designed to
     influence where people are permitted to live (zoning, national parks) and,
     increasingly, how they live / how much they consume.

     In general, the successful implementation of population control is likely to reduce
     demand for resources, and decrease the likelihood of adverse human-induced
     environmental impacts. Successful population control is therefore normally
     associated with an improvement in the degree of sustainability.

     However, population control alone is insufficient to ensure environmental
     sustainability, so a number of other factors such as political will, society’s sense of its
     relationship with the natural environment, public awareness, and desire to see progress
     only in terms of economic growth, will also be important. Equally, continued
     population growth may not be an obstacle to long-term sustainability if new
     technologies are developed and recycling, substitution, and conservation are embraced.

     Stronger responses are likely to consider more than one scale (local, national, regional,
     global), but this is not a requirement for full marks. It is possible to gain full marks if
     the response focuses on only one or two points, such as over-consumption in some
     societies, so long as it is done in a well-argued and well-supported way.

     Answers that do not show an understanding of environmental sustainability should
     not move beyond band D.

     Responses based on appropriate, well-supported ideas and examples, and which
     arrive at some conclusion about the statement are likely to be credited at bands E/F.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

6.   Examine the changing importance of energy sources other than oil.                         [15 marks]

     Answers should focus on the changing importance (production/consumption) of other
     major energy sources. Responses could look at other non-renewable fossil fuels such
     as coal and natural gas and renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, bio-fuel,
     geothermal, tidal, hydroelectric power and of course nuclear power – although it is not
     essential to cover all.

     Answers should recognize that the global demand for energy is increasing as
     populations grow and countries develop economically. Most, if not all, of the energy
     sources above are becoming increasingly important in terms of production and
     consumption. Some quantitative or qualitative detail would be expected in terms of
     explaining and comparing the changed importance.

     Stronger responses may consider at least one fossil fuel, renewables and nuclear
     energy. Answers may also refer to any scale (local, national, regional, global), but
     this is not a requirement for the award of full marks. A discussion of national energy
     sources might link with the concept of energy security – this approach should be
     highly credited if done well.

     Answers that do not describe a range of energy sources and do not examine their
     changing importance should not progress beyond band D.

     Responses based on appropriate, well-supported ideas and examples and which
     arrive at some conclusion about the changing importance of these sources of energy
     are likely to be credited at bands E/F.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

7.   “Development does not always reduce social and economic disparities.”
     Discuss this statement, referring to examples.                                       [15 marks]

     A variety of responses would be acceptable. A candidate could agree with the
     statement using examples. A candidate could disagree with the statement using
     appropriate examples. The best responses will use examples that do both.

     It is likely that development is explained and candidates may explore social
     development as well as economic development and the importance of education, etc.
     for reducing economic (income/GDP/PPP/labour) disparities over time. Other themes
     that may be explored could include formal/informal labour markets, migration,
     patterns of land ownership/tenure.

     Some answers will focus on the persistence of inequality in developed and emerging
     economies (for example, USA, India) and may use a range of evidence to
     support this. Others may take a temporal approach, looking at how development has
     at first increased economic disparities but which have subsequently lessened.
     A core-periphery analysis using spread/trickle-down ideas would be another valid
     approach.

     Approaches that do not involve a discussion of the statement but rather describe
     methods of reducing disparities should not progress beyond band D.

     Responses based on appropriate, well-supported examples, which formulate an
     opinion towards the statement are likely to be credited at bands E/F.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
