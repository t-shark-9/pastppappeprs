 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
         structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
         insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
         than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8: The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present,
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

Pre-colonial African states (Eastern and Central Africa) 1840–1900

1.   What roles were played by Kabaka Suuna and Kabaka Mutesa in the growth of the Buganda
     Kingdom before 1884?

     Buganda developed into a powerful and centralized kingdom for a number of reasons. The roles
     played by the two leaders must be clearly identified. The two leaders played a major part in the rise
     of this kingdom and its establishment as one of the strongest kingdoms of the East African interior.
     Its power made it one of the most dreaded kingdoms in the region. The factors for its growth can be
     divided into political, social and economic and should also be attributed to the two leaders.

     As kings their role in the establishment of a stable and effective government system must be clearly
     brought out. The Kabaka appointed chiefs for their loyalty. They were given various gifts
     including land. This ensured that chiefs remained faithful to the Kabaka. Provinces were given a
     little independence and all that was demanded of them was the payment of tribute to the Kabaka.
     This was the chosen method of controlling the provinces yet making them feel responsible for
     themselves. Under Kabaka Mutesa the Baganda Kingdom conquered new territories, including
     huge sections of Bunyoro, and this doubled the size of Buganda’s land. In this way, the
     government was able to accumulate revenue for its provision of services to the people of the
     kingdom. Large standing armies were used to protect the kingdom especially from external attacks.
     Through trade with the Arabs items were acquired, including weapons, which were used by the
     armies in their numerous expeditions. The two leaders also continued to emphasise the
     development of agriculture which was at the center of the Buganda economy. The society was
     organized so that women were used as farm labourers while the men were away taking part in wars
     of expansion or in other nation building activities e.g. road construction. Other agricultural
     products used for trading included coffee, bark cloth, bananas and ivory. In general candidates
     should demonstrate the good political, social and economic organization implemented by the two
     leaders all of which contributed to the growth of the Buganda Kingdom.

2.   To what extent was Tewodros II’s policy of centralization the main cause of his failure to unify
     Ethiopia?

     Candidates should be able to explain what was wrong with the way Tewodros introduced the
     centralized system. Candidates must explain the reasons for the failure of this system. After that,
     candidates are expected to discuss the other factors that contributed to his failure as a leader.
     In conclusion they should explain to what extent they think centralization was the major reason for
     his failure as a leader. Ethiopia had a very strong feudal nobility system which had existed for
     a long time. The introduction of a centralized system was therefore going against the traditional
     set up. Tewodros failed to convince the feudal nobles to embrace the new system.

     His aim to reunite the people of Ethiopia also failed since as a leader he failed to get the people to
     understand the importance of this reunification. The motive was good but he failed to get the
     people on his side. His emotional weaknesses, mainly his bad temper, which made him declare
     many people guilty eventually leading to their death, should also be mentioned since this
     undermined his position as a leader. He alienated the church through his various reforms that
     directly infringed upon the privileges of the church. This meant that he lost the support of a
     majority of the people who supported the church. Due to an increase in resistance towards his
     reforms, he introduced harsh measures that made his position in the kingdom even worse. His
     support in the army was also affected by the various administrative reforms he carried out.

     Candidates must clearly explain how instead of unifying the Ethiopian population, Tewodros’
     reforms actually divided his people instead.

     Candidates must look at other reasons for his failure to unify Ethiopia and not just the failure of the
     implementation of the centralized system of government.

Pre-colonial African states (Southern and West Africa) 1800–1900

3.   To what extent was the destruction of established states the most important effect of the
     Mfecane?

     Candidates should explain how the Mfecane was responsible for the destruction of kingdoms that
     already existed in the areas it affected. They should then look at the other effects of the Mfecane
     and weigh up the effects to decide which one was the most important effect: destruction of
     established kingdoms or other factors.

     The effects of the Mfecane were many and can be considered as social, economic and political.
     The factors can also be considered under the division of positive and negative effects. Established
     states which had been considered strong like the Rozwi Empire of Zimbabwe, the Lozi kingdom of
     Zambia and the Undi Empire of Malawi failed to resist the effects of the Mfecane and ended up
     being destroyed. On the other hand, candidates must also note that new strong multi-ethnic states
     also emerged as a result of the Mfecane. Examples that can be mentioned include the Gaza
     of Mozambique, the Ndebele, the Tswana and the Zulu.

     Another effect that can be discussed is the spread of Zulu military techniques e.g. communities now
     preferred the use of short stabbing spear instead of the clumsy long spear. The bull horn formation
     popularly used with great success during the Mfecane and the regiment age system were also
     adopted by other communities. An immediate effect of the Mfecane was death and destruction in a
     vast area of the interior. The Mfecane was also closely linked with the increase in slavery.
     Economic activities like agriculture and trading activities between communities was also greatly
     affected by the Mfecane. Candidates may also draw a clear link between the Mfecane and the Great
     Trek.

     Candidates must therefore look at other factors also and not just the destruction of the established
     states as the only effect.


4.   “Mosheshwe was the great architect of the Sotho Kingdom.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     Candidates should be able to explain what role Mosheshwe played in the creation of the Sotho
     Kingdom, but they must also give other factors that made the creation of this kingdom possible.

     Mosheshwe is well-known as the founder of Basutoland. Candidates must highlight the importance
     of his use of traditional methods in the maintaining of unity among the Sotho people. Unlike other
     leaders of his time, Mosheshwe ensured that wars were only fought in self defence. During the
     Mfecane, he was able to absorb refugees into his Kingdom many of whom contributed to the
     growth of kingdom. He increased the power of his army by emphasizing the use of battle axe and
     his cavalry force was used for protection purposes against the kingdoms numerous enemies. As a
     paramount leader of the Sotho, he used his power to save his cattle from neighbouring invaders
     through the Mafisa system. Cattle were considered as being very important by the Sotho people. In
     order to strengthen his kingdom, he formed political alliances with neighbouring communities such
     as the Moorosi. Through polygamy strong ties were established. To ensure loyalty among the
     absorbed refugees he allowed them to retain their traditional leaders. At the district level, he
     appointed his relatives to assure full control of these areas. Disputes which were a likely cause of
     discontent among the people were effectively dealt with through the Pitso method. His charisma
     and moral influence among his people must be mentioned as key factors in the uniting of his people.
     As a radical reformer Christian funerals were allowed. The death penalty and the killing of witches,
     which were rampant at the time, were both banned. Through all this he was able to create a strong
     Sotho Kingdom.

European imperialism and annexation of Africa 1850–1900

5.   “Disunity was the most important factor that facilitated the European annexation of Africa.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The European annexation of Africa was made possible by a number of factors. Disunity was indeed
     one of the factors in some areas. The disunity weakened traditional society to the extent that it was
     very easy for the European powers to divide and rule and even effectively used one community
     against its neighbours. Disunity of African society was also rampant through the slaving activities
     that existed in some communities which was a clear indication of the economic and social
     differences in these societies. Some of the societies were also clearly stratified with the existence of
     the royal families etc. The type of society therefore determined how easy or how difficult
     annexation of the area would be.

     On the other hand, many African societies were small and often organized on a clan or age group
     basis. For various reasons, these states would sometimes be at war against each other. Succession
     disputes in many areas were responsible for the civil wars that took place e.g. in Itsekiriland. Trade
     rivalries, cultural and religious fervor also led to outbreak of wars. Good examples of these would
     be Ethiopia and the Mahdist state. All this made it easy for the European invaders to divide
     Africans even further and then conquer them with very little resistance in some areas. Disunity
     therefore was responsible for the lack of coordinated resistance among many of the African states,
     thus making annexation easier.

     On other factors, candidates can talk about the improved transport system through the invention of
     the steamship, and also the introduction of the telegraph system which enhanced communication.

     Military weakness: the Europeans had weapons that were superior compared to what was in use in
     Africa at the time e.g. the Gatling and Maxim gun. These were used against African soldiers who
     were equipped with crude weapons like the old fashioned muzzle loading guns, traditional spears,
     bows and arrows. These were no match for the sophisticated colonial guns. European heavy
     artillery also proved very destructive. Unlike a number of the traditional African armies, European
     armies were well trained and disciplined and this made then more successful in battle. Very few
     African communities had standing armies meaning that soldiers were less well trained and therefore
     no match for the invading colonial armies. Local armies relied heavily on traditional military
     tactics. Some African soldiers also contributed to the success of the colonial armies.

     Many of the colonialists followed missionaries to areas where Christianity had already been
     introduced and in most cases such communities collaborated with the colonialists.

     Mention must be made that in some areas there was cultural unity and this made it possible for
     some of the communities to resist the European invaders. Mention can be made of the fact that
     delayed imperialism in places like Ethiopia was made possible through the unity that existed.

6.   “Colonial exploitation at its worst.” In what ways does this statement describe the activities
     of King Leopold II in the Congo?

     The European powers had hoped that by Leopold establishing his rule in the Congo, he would help
     fight slave trade in the area. This did not happen because, instead, Leopold was held responsible for
     great cruelty during his leadership.

     Huge parcels of land were confiscated from local people by the European powers for their own use
     and also for the construction of the railway line. Forced labour was introduced. Apart from being
     forced to work on rubber farms, Africans were forced to pay tax in the form of ivory and rubber.
     Rubber farmers were paid very little for their product. Anyone who was seen not to be supporting
     the government in any way was harshly punished through flogging, mutilation of their hands, death
     or even having their villages destroyed. Forced labour meant that the Africans were left with
     absolutely no time to take care of their own personal economic activities. To avoid the harsh
     treatment, many of the people fled the area. The eventual effect of all this was that
     with the reduction in farming activities, lack of food became rampant and many areas were also
     greatly depopulated. When this became known it was as a result of the activities of groups e.g.
     the Quakers and the media both of which revealed the atrocities and led to the pressure which
     forced Leopold to hand over the Congo to the Belgian State.

7.   What enabled the Nandi in Kenya to resist British rule for over a decade?

     Candidates must give a clear analysis of the various factors that enabled the Nandi to resist colonial
     invasion.

     One reason why the Nandi were able to resist the British was because of their great numbers.
     Six thousand out of a population of some forty thousand were warriors. This was a huge number
     for the colonial forces to deal with.

     Another major advantage was that, unlike the colonial forces, the Nandi were fighting in an area
     they knew very well. Nandi land is mainly mountainous, very steep and mostly forested. This
     therefore made it easy for the Nandi to use guerilla warfare which was quite effective against the
     colonial forces. The use of rifles by colonial forces was a total failure due to the terrain they were
     fighting in.

     The Nandi had an advantage in that they relied on mixed farming. Therefore whenever they were
     under attack and agriculture could not go on, they could rely on their cattle. They could easily
     survive unlike their invaders who would then get very little in terms of food. The use of porters to
     carry foodstuffs for the colonial soldiers slowed them down.

     The existence of a well disciplined, efficient and trained army among the Nandi who had fought and
     won wars against their Maasai neighbours also made it possible for them to resist the invading
     colonial forces

     Traditional military tactics including their famous night attacks and the use of different age groups
     during attack meant that the destruction of one group only paved way for the attack by another
     group. The military commanders were easily replaced through the use of a democratic system
     which proved very efficient.

     The Nandi had a strong leadership under the Orkoiyot who was both a political and religious leader
     and this played a major part in the unity of the Nandi. Nandi morale had been greatly boosted by
     their successful resistance against the railway builders and coastal traders. The Nandi became
     greatly demoralized with the death of Koitalel.

8.   “Forced labour was the major cause of the Maji Maji Rising of 1905 and destruction was its
     major consequence.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates should explain the role played by the issue of forced labour in the cotton plantations in
     the Maji Maji Rising, and also explain, whether among the effects, the destruction of property was
     most important. Among the causes are economic factors like forced labour, taxation and the cotton
     programme (social factors include the activities of the Christian missionaries who were against
     traditional religion which existed and were blamed for the burning of sacred huts belonging to the
     highly respected priests). Candidates must make it clear that many communities were involved in
     the Maji Maji Rising and that there were some factors that were very specific to individual
     communities. German soldiers had, for example, been accused of abusing the Ngindo women and
     this caused a lot of discontent among that group of people. The Ngoni, on the other hand, joined the
     rebellion in retaliation for the Boma massacre of 1897 when some of their political leaders and
     generals were killed or imprisoned. Being a powerful group in the area, they felt that the Germans
     had undermined their power in a number of ways. It must be made clear that the Maji Maji
     rebellion was carried out by various communities and each of them had their own reason for joining
     the rebellion.

     Despite failing, among its effects, it should be noted that the rebellion united some of the
     communities in the area in which it occurred. It must also be noted that some of the Hehe did not
     support the rebellion, but fought on the side of the Germans. Among its positive effects, candidates
     must note that it forced the German administration to introduce a number of reforms that benefitted
     the Africans. They were also given the freedom of choice on whether to work on colonial farms or
     not, and there was strict punishment for any settler who mistreated Africans. For more efficiency
     some of the traditional chiefs were replaced by young missionary educated men. The importance of
     unity for the success of colonial resistance was a major lesson learnt. This led to educated Africans
     demanding for not only self-improvement but also for their constitutional rights. All this eventually
     led to the formation of political parties like TANU which eventually led them to attain their
     independence.

9.   Discuss the causes and the effects of the Herero and the Nama resistance (1904–1907) against
     German rule in South-west Africa.

     Initially the Herero had collaborated with the Germans with the aim of having them assist in the
     fight against their neighbouring enemies, but in January 1904, led by Samuel Maherero, the Herero
     carried out a series of spontaneous revolts against their former German allies. One reason that
     candidates must identify is the land issue. With the increase in number of German settlers on their
     land the Herero realized that more and more of them were going to lose their land. Railway
     construction was also going to take up more of their land. Economically they had suffered with the
     loss of their cattle to rinderpest. Land was therefore very important for them at this stage. The
     Germans had introduced a credit system which in the long run did not benefit the Africans at all.
     Failure to repay the credit on time, meant that they would have their cattle confiscated. Clear
     reasons for their discontent must be brought out by candidates.

     The Nama rising began in October 1904 under the leadership of Hendrik Witbooi. Like the Herero,
     they were also rebelling against the German system of rule. Like the Herero they had lost both their
     land and cattle. The immediate cause of the revolt was different from that of the Herero. They
     were greatly provoked by the Germans who, in order to weaken them, insisted on disarming and
     dispersing their community. Their resistance lasted much longer than that of the Herero, through
     their effective use of guerrilla warfare.

     Unlike the Herero revolt where Maherero was able to escape and seek refuge in Tswana land,
     Witbooi was killed in battle in October (1905) and his place was taken over by Jakob Morenga.

     In both cases many of those caught were punished by being sent into prison camps where many
     of them died. In both cases, the communities ended up losing land. For those who survived,
     forced labour and deportation was the punishment. Many of the subjects became landless.

     If only causes or results are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

10.   For what reasons did the Mandinka Empire fail to resist French conquest in the period
      1880 to 1898?

      It took approximately 20 years for Samori Toure to build up the Mandinka Empire. Samori’s initial
      attempt to form an alliance against the French with Ahmadu failed for various reasons. In 1886 he
      signed the Franco–Mandinka Peace Treaty through which he hoped to defeat his neighbours like the
      Sikasso. The period 1886–1891 seemed quite peaceful but this is the time the French decided to
      undermine Samori. Samori who had thought that the French were his friends, had therefore greatly
      underestimated his friendship with them.

      Mention must be made of the fact that Samori was not on good terms with many of his neighbours
      since he enslaved many of their peoples.

      The French worked against him, e.g. through providing weapons to his enemies like Sikasso. The
      Great Revolt of 1888–1890 gave the French the opportunity to invade Samori’s Northern Province,
      an area inhabited by people who were against Samori’s rule. His attempt to form an alliance with
      the British against the French also failed and this left him with no proper ally. With the collapse of
      the Tokolor Empire, which was another strong empire in the area, the French were now able to fully
      focus on Samori’s Empire. Samori’s resistance failed and the French were able to take control of
      the Mandinka Empire. He was able to put up strong resistance through reorganizing his military
      forces. He can therefore be blamed for having initially trusted the French, but it must be made clear
      that he put up very strong resistance and other factors also contributed to the defeat of the Mandinka
      Empire.

Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

11.   “Smuts and Hertzog laid the foundations of the apartheid system.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      Smuts served under General Botha until he became prime minister in 1919. He is described as an
      educated man with great insight in the areas of religion and philosophy. Civilisation and
      improvement of the lives of the natives seemed to have been his main area of emphasis. To him the
      Africans were not ready for involvement in politics and should therefore leave politics to the whites.
      With Botha, their African policy was made up of baaskap, which consisted of the colour bar and
      pass laws and some form of racial segregation. Africans were to provide cheap labour both in farms
      and in the mines. When mine workers went on strike in 1922 in the rand due to low wages, Smuts
      used soldiers to bring down what he called a rebellion and this was a sign of brutality. According
      to Hertzog, who is considered as one of the architects of the apartheid system, the white attitude
      towards the Africans was caused by the fear that they would be overwhelmed by the blacks and the
      only way to deal with this would be to advocate for the physical separation of the races. This would
      in turn lead to the creation of two South Africas: one black and one white. Accordingly they
      believed that the Africans would then gain some land and to some extent also gain some form of
      local self-government. He believed in the supremacy of the Afrikaans language above other
      languages.

      In 1934 Smuts’ and Hertzog’s parties united, with Smuts’ side being responsible for the support and
      introduction of the Natives Representation Act introduced in 1936 which brought an end to the
      registration of qualified Africans as voters in the Cape Province.

      The “Purified Nationalists”, who were against Hertzog emerged and advocated stern measures to be
      taken to ensure that South Africa is reserved only for the whites and not for the blacks. This group
      was led by Daniel François Malan, Prime Minister from 1948–1954. He is considered by many to
      be the founder of the apartheid system. His ideas were considered as being generally extreme
      compared to those of both Hertzog and Smuts.

      If only Smuts or Hertzog addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

12.   For what reasons, and with what effects, did the Africans resist apartheid in South Africa?

      African workers in the gold mines were poorly paid. They were isolated in the marginal native
      reserves, but had to come to the white towns as migrant workers without their families.
      The land retained by the Africans was inadequate to sustain them. Africans only occupied 7 % of
      the land in South Africa yet they formed three quarters of the population. Many Africans who
      opted to move out of the reserves were forced to live in slums on the outskirts of the white towns
      where amenities were extremely poor. Those who worked on the farms were strictly under the
      control of their white masters. Wages for Africans were low yet they were expected to pay taxes to
      the government. Due to colour bar laws, Africans were only allowed to perform specified jobs,
      usually manual. Strikes were totally forbidden and those who attempted to strike were ruthlessly
      dealt with. Pass laws restricted the movement of the Africans. The Afrikaans language was
      considered the official language, even in schools for Africans, against the wish of the African
      population. Africans had absolutely no political rights and they therefore had to struggle to attain
      them through the African National Congress.

      The effects of the resistance to the apartheid system were many. There were deaths, especially
      during strikes and demonstrations. Many key leaders were arrested and imprisoned. The divide
      and the hatred between the whites and blacks grew and many Africans who feared for their lives
      were forced into exile in neighbouring countries. Eventually resistance to apartheid produced
      leaders who led the Africans to their fight for independence.

      If only reasons or effects are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Africa under colonialism 1890–1980

13.   In what ways did colonial rule in Nyasaland or Kenya or Mozambique affect the lives of
      Africans?

      Colonial rule in all these countries had both positive and negative effects on the local people. (East
      African Protectorate which later became Kenya was delimited in 1895.) The British divided the
      colony into provinces and districts. Many of the Kenyan communities were based on the clan
      system with only few like the Wanga having a somewhat centralized system. The British made
      major changes to the economic system that had existed. Transportation was improved through the
      construction of the railway system. Emphasis on new crops like coffee and cotton should be
      mentioned. In such areas, land was forcefully taken from the Africans and given to white settlers.
      These settlers then came to dominate the political affairs of the country. The old systems of land
      tenure and agriculture were slowly being replaced by new methods. Taxes, the pass system, and
      forced labour were introduced all of which were alien to the local people. A new monetary system
      was also introduced. Trade became more complex. New political systems were also introduced
      which slowly replaced the old chieftainship system. New education and religious systems were also
      introduced. The strong family set up was also slowly interfered with. Other major changes e.g.
      medical facilities etc. must be discussed clearly indicating how they affected the lives of the locals.

      Nyasaland (Malawi) was a British Protectorate and it was considered as a poor but beautiful
      country. It had a very high population of Africans and did not have too many European
      immigrants. The European immigrants included government workers, missionaries and farmers.
      There were also Asian traders and a small mixed population. By the 1890s huge tracts of land had
      been given out to the European settlers and various companies in the area. No reserves were set up
      in Nyasaland. The Native Trust Land Order in Council set land aside for the Africans. In some
      cases Africans became settlers in the Native trust Lands. Through the government efforts, the
      Africans were able to hold a huge percentage of the land in Nyasaland. Some of the African
      squatters on the European lands had to pay rents and they could also be easily evicted thus
      becoming landless. Due to high population, many of the areas were overcrowded for example the
      Shire Highlands. Many of the Africans shifted from growing subsistence crops to cash crops in
      order to earn more income. Many co-operative societies were set up to help them market their
      products like coffee, cotton etc. Meanwhile they still relied on the tradition markets to sell their
      produce. On the other hand the African fish farmers gained from government support. Good means
      of transportation was provided to ensure faster and efficient transportation of the fish and other
      produce. Lack of industries in Nyasaland meant that many of the Africans had to become migrant
      labourers in neighbouring countries. This led to the breaking up of families and many of the men
      became known as the lost ones who ended up marrying other women wherever they had settled.
      With Nyasaland being colonized, the Africans also got involved in the two world wars. Vocational
      and primary education was also introduced for the Africans, medical services were improved, and
      the African chiefs were also included in the administrative system.

      Mozambique was colonized by the Portuguese. By mid 1960s there were about 130 000 whites in
      Mozambique. Many of them came in as farmers and were sponsored by the government.
      Agriculture and mining was controlled by the Portuguese and Africans were used as labourers.
      New crops were introduced e.g. cassava, maize, peanuts and tobacco. The slave trade also
      intensified. Racial policy was applied and for any African to be considered a citizen they were
      subjected to economic, religious and academic test. This meant that very few Africans became
      “assimilados” or were assimilated. Land was given to foreign companies who were allowed to use
      forced labour, collect taxes and also come up with laws to control the Africans. Many of the
      Africans remained illiterate and only very few of them got jobs in the colonial administration.
      Education was restricted leading to a high level of illiteracy among the Africans. There were many
      African migrant workers from Mozambique to Tanzania, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa
                                                  – 16 –              N12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M

      where they were able to pick up revolutionary ideas. The Africans were also subjected to strict
      police surveillance and censorship of the press. To improve their economic situation the Africans in
      Mozambique set up their own cooperative societies.

      Candidates should therefore discuss the impact of colonial rule in reference to one of the countries
      listed. The best answers will include social, economic and political impacts of colonial rule, both
      positives and negatives.


14.   To what extent did the strength of the African political systems in Northern Nigeria lead to
      the British adoption of the system of indirect rule in the rest of Nigeria?

      Candidates must demonstrate a clear understanding of the traditional political systems and indicate
      clearly how these systems influenced the British choice of rule.

      To understand British rule in Nigeria, we must realize that Nigeria was divided into two:
      Southern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria. In Yoruba land (South Nigeria) the indirect system of rule
      had some degree of success due to the fact there was the existence of some form of chieftaincy and
      kingship system (centralized system). In the north where there were the emirates, the indirect
      system seemed to have worked quite well.

      This system was applied because the British did not have enough personnel; it was therefore
      cheaper since it relied on the political systems which were already in existence in Nigerian society.
      In some of the areas, like in Sokoto, powerful rulers lost their powers and were reduced to the level
      of the emirs. It must be mentioned that there was resistance to this system in some areas.

      In South East Nigeria, mention must be made of the fact that Macdonald introduced the posts of
      warrant chief in both the Niger delta and Igboland. This system failed because indirect rule could
      not be successfully applied to the traditional political systems that existed in this area. Political
      systems here were highly decentralized through lineages, age grades etc. They had no chiefs in
      charge of villages or clans, who the British may have used, although there were village councils in
      some areas e.g. among the Aro clan of the Igbo. Community heads acted as arbitrators and not as
      executives, thus making it difficult for the British to use their positions for their benefit. The
      traditional set up therefore made it very difficult for the Africans to accept the warrant chiefs
      appointed by the British. Many of those appointed as warrant chiefs were not respected by their
      own people for various reasons. The system failed further when Lugard insisted on establishing
      uniformity in the administration of the so-called natives throughout Nigeria because in reality, there
      was no uniformity.

Social and economic developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries 1800–1960

15.   Discuss the impact of the spread of Christianity on African society.

      The spread of Christianity had both positive and negative effects. With Christianity individualism
      which was foreign to African society was introduced. The importance of the extended family was
      therefore deminished. With the missionaries e.g. the priest taking the key position in the lives of the
      Christians, traditional authority and customs were eroded. For example polygamy, which was
      common in Africa; was forbidden and replaced by monogamy. In certain areas, the traditional
      economy was also transformed with the introduction or emphasis of cash crops and other crops that
      were not indigenous to African society. The traditional African was therefore made to take up cash
      crop farming so as to earn cash for tax, fees and tithe. Traditional medicine and medicine men were
      replaced by the introduction of western style hospitals and medicines. New systems of education
      based on western lines were also introduced and soon European languages slowly gained equal
      importance with traditional languages which had earlier been used as the main medium of
      communication. Despite the introduction of these languages, mention must be made of the fact that
      traditional languages were preserved through the translation of the Bible and other books into
      African languages. Writing became a very important method of communication. Various courses
      were offered through mission institutions where Africans were equipped with skills that eventually
      enabled them to take up jobs e.g. as clerks, store keepers etc. The problem with the education is
      that it was limited in that it focused mainly on the three Rs thus keeping the Africans at the lower
      level especially in settler societies. Many of those who achieved missionary education also played
      an important role in the fight for equality and political reforms.


16.   Explain the effects of the slave trade using evidence from one of the following areas: Eastern
      and Central Africa; South Africa; West Africa; North Africa.

      Social, economic and political effects of the slave trade must be discussed. Candidates must clearly
      identify the region they are dealing with. Full effects of the slave trade can never be assessed.
      There was the obvious suffering that the slaves were subjected to. Many of the slaves were able
      bodied men and thus African society was denied the contribution of these men once they were taken
      away. This disrupted the traditional economic activities in the societies affected. Many of these
      slaves died or were taken to other areas never to return home. Many areas of Africa were
      depopulated. Many wealthy slave traders also emerged who greatly benefitted from the slave trade
      activities e.g. Tippu Tip. Side by side with slave trade, the trade in ivory also intensified. The
      operations of a number of African states were disrupted by the slave trade in a number of ways. For
      their survival, states like Benin, Dahomey and Asante diverted their energies from peaceful
      developments within their states to slaving wars. The decline of the Oyo Empire was also partly
      due to the slave trade activities. Constant hostility existed and intensified between neighbouring
      states e.g. Buganda and her neighbours, Nyamwezi. Some of the members of the communities
      being attacked were forced to flee. For example in West Africa, the area east of the Cross River
      basin became home to many homeless people who had fled their homes due to the fearful slaving
      activities. In West Africa slave trade was responsible for the formation of Freetown and Liberia.

      In general it must be noted that slave trade undermined the key elements of civilization and growth
      in Africa.

17.   What were the causes and effects of the Mau Mau Rising in Kenya?

      Candidates must ensure that they handled both parts of the question, the causes and the
      consequences. These can be looked at in terms of social, economic and political causes and effects.
      Land issues, the corrosion of the traditional African family and religion must be explained in detail.
      Issues of forced labour, the sending of Africans into reserves like Olenguruone, must be mentioned.
      The discrimination as far as jobs were concerned and lack of political freedom must also be
      handled. The kipande system which prohibited the free movement of the Africans needs to be
      explained. The prohibition of other political ways of airing the views of Africans, like the ban on
      trade unions, also played a major role. The increase in taxes and the amount that had to be paid also
      led to discontent among Kenyans. The activities of the missionaries were also not accepted by
      some of the members of the African community.

      As a result of the Mau Mau Rising some reforms were implemented by the colonial government.
      Many of those who were seen to have spearheaded the rebellion were put into detention. Many
      people died, properties destroyed, economic activities were affected during the rising, and detention
      camps were set up where many people suffered. Many families were disrupted with members
      joining the Mau Mau Rising away from their homes.

      Without the Mau Mau Rising, then the fight for independence may not have intensified as it did and
      the unity caused by the Mau Mau Rising did contribute to the attainment of independence. Many
      war heroes emerged as a result of this rising.

      If only causes of consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

18.   Compare and contrast the roles played by Ian Smith and Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe’s
      attainment of independence.

      Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) was a British settler colony. Ian Smith was the leader of the
      Rhodesian Front government. Under his leadership the Rhodesian Front was able to strengthen its
      hold on the European community. In 1965, the Front was able to take all the 50 European seats.
      Negotiations with the British were therefore not easy at this stage since the British were only
      willing to hand over power to a government which was representative of the Rhodesian people as a
      whole (both black and white). The British insisted that they would only grant independence if the
      constitution allowed for black Africans to hold at least a third of the seats in parliament. Ian Smith
      rejected this idea and argued that it was only white rule that would solve post-independence
      problems. The Front led by Ian Smith therefore had to demonstrate that they were fully
      representing the Rhodesian people and as a result, they had to call for referendums and also called
      for meetings of the Induna to convince the British, but this did not appeal to the British. In
      November 1965 therefore Smith declared Southern Rhodesia Independent against the wishes of
      Britain. Power at this time had therefore been illegally handed over to the Rhodesians.

      Smith did all that was possible to delay black majority rule, using the division between the African
      leaders as an excuse. ZAPU under Joshua Nkomo, and ZANU under Ndabaningi Sithole. Robert
      Mugabe was the leader of the guerilla wing of ZANU, while UANC was led by Bishop Muzorewa.
      Smith tried to form a joint government with UANC. ZANU-PF and PF-ZAPU had mass support
      and so continued with their guerrilla warfare. Smith was therefore forced into admitting defeat
      leading to the British calling for the Lancaster House Conference in London (September and
      December 1979). In the elections that ensued, Mugabe’s ZANU won with 57 seats out of the 80
      reserved for the blacks Africans. Eventually this gave Mugabe an overall majority thus leading to
      his becoming Prime Minister. When ZANU and ZAPU merged in 1987, Mugabe became the first
      Executive President.

Nationalist and independence movements (Southern and West Africa)

19.   What was the role played by the MPLA and UNITA in Angola’s attainment of independence?

      Angola was a Portuguese colony. Africans in the Portuguese colonies and in Angola became very
      conscious of the existence of the Europeans in their territory. As the number of whites in Angola
      increased steadily, issues of forced labour and loss of land also intensified. Intellectual
      development among the Africans was also restricted in order to ensure control by the Portuguese.
      To avoid war, many of the Africans from Angola went into self exile in the Congo and Northern
      Rhodesia. In these countries they were able to pick up revolutionary ideas which they later brought
      back home. A good example is Agostinho Neto, who returned from exile in 1959, and returned to
      Luanda to join the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola). His political party
      greatly appealed to the young assimilados. Neto was arrested, jailed in Portugal but eventually
      found his way back as the leader of MPLA in exile and he continued with his push for
      independence.

      In 1961 among other forms of violence, several Africans who were suspected to have been
      organized by the MPLA attacked the main prison in Luanda so as to release political prisoners in
      the prison. Several Africans were shot at in retaliation. In 1963 the MPLA headquarters had to
      shift from Kinshasa (Leopoldville) to Brazzaville. From there they failed to stir up trouble in
      the Portuguese stronghold such as Cabinda. In 1966 the HQ moved again to Zambia with the
      aim of organizing attacks on Angola through the highly populated areas like Moxico and
      Cuando-Cubango. Similar attempts were also being carried out by the UNITA (National Union
      for the Total Independence of Angola) forces which were mainly composed of supporters from
      Ovimbundu. They promised the Portuguese to help fight against the MPLA in return for better
      treatment from the Portuguese. Together with the MPLA, UNITA was able to put pressure on the
      Portuguese. For example, they had to keep an army of over 60 000 in Angola and this put a strain
      on Portugal’s economy. The Portuguese army lost morale and suffered major losses. With the
      military take over in Portugal, Angola benefited by being granted independence in November 1975.

20.   “Kwame Nkrumah’s personality was the most important factor for his success in leading
      Ghana to independence in 1957.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Nkrumah had personal qualities which did lead to his success, but there were other factors that also
      came into play. He was a good organizer who ably took up the role of a full time organizer of the
      United Gold Coast Convention. He was critical of the new constitution and this is what led to him
      forming his own political party the Convention People’s Party which eventually won elections in
      1951. He was a charismatic leader who easily appealed to the people. He therefore appealed
      greatly to the new generation of highly educated youth who supported him in his struggle for
      independence. The CPP was appealing even to the war pensioners, market women and wage
      workers, and this added to its popularity.

      He was able to work as leader of government business and as prime minister which enabled him to
      get his political footing. These were both key positions which he held very well thus winning him
      even more support from the people.

      Other factors candidates can consider include the fact that the Gold Coast was a prosperous region
      in itself. Due to lack of British settlers in the region, the British were also very willing to
      decolonize.

21.   With reference to any two African countries studied, discuss the major causes and effects of
      civil wars since independence.

      Candidates must first identify the two countries they will be referring to. The issue of land has been
      one of the major causes of civil war in Africa. Ethnic differences (here candidates may use Angola,
      Burundi, Chad, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Liberia as examples), religious differences,
      political differences especially in resource rich countries (examples here would include oil rich
      countries or what has been referred to as “conflict diamonds”), marginalization of some of the
      communities, where one community feels left out or feels discriminated against etc. should be
      explained in detail. Political issues like the lack of true political freedom can also be tackled.
      In some areas, military coups have also been responsible for the civil wars. Bad governance,
      especially by the government of the day, rampant inequalities have all led to civil wars.

      Among the effects, candidates should consider destruction of infrastructure, death of innocent
      civilians, refugees in foreign lands and also the development of internally displaced peoples,
      insecurity and the development of more and more political parties which only worsen the situation.
      Investors are also afraid of getting involved in such areas and this has had a massive impact on the
      economies of such countries. Collapse of governments and the creation of new governments have
      also been some of the effects of civil wars. In some cases, the society gets divided even more
      especially where the initial problem has not been tackled. Some of the countries have had their
      economies totally brought down by civil wars.

      If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

22.   With reference to any two African countries, discuss the major challenges experienced when
      dealing with social and economic problems.

      Countries in Africa have been faced by social, economic and political problems while trying to sort
      out the problems they have experienced since independence. The two countries used must be
      identified. Inequality leading to corruption has led to a lot economic problems since independence.
      During the partition and throughout the colonial period, unity of the former traditional communities
      was as a result of their opposition to colonial rule. Now that the problem of colonialism was over,
      one major challenge after independence was to find ways of maintaining this unity to enable them
      to deal with their economic and social problems.

      The existence of weak institutions like the labour unions and professional associations, some of
      which fail to properly represent their members, also presents problems to many new governments.

      The nineteenth century was characterized by a period of nation building among the African states.
      This process of nation building was interfered with by the arrival of the colonialist. After
      independence, a different process of nation building begun again in some parts of Africa and this
      was partly responsible for the inter-communal wars that ensued.

      Lack of expertise to deal with the real problems affecting these countries has been a problem; this
      has sometimes led to over-reliance on foreign help. Lack of finance which is a problem has led to
      an even bigger problem that of debt.

      The colonial powers had introduced government systems modelled on those of their individual
      home countries. They created offices like those of governors and legislative councils which were
      not necessarily suitable for the African set up. It was therefore a challenge for the independent
      countries to modify these systems to suit their own needs. This may have contributed to the
      creation of the single party systems which became prevalent in many parts of Africa.

      After independence, many Africans did not have the leadership skills to rule since they had not been
      given the opportunity to exercise such skills by the colonialists. Bureaucracies were immediately
      established and those employed were totally inexperienced thus affecting the efficiency of these
      new organizations after independence.

      Dealing with natural disasters has been an uphill struggle e.g. famine in North East Africa, floods,
      deforestation etc. and has exhausted many of the finances of these countries.

      In the economic area, the Africans have remained producers and exporters of primary products
      while on the other hand they are the key consumers and importers of industrial goods; this has led to
      unbalanced trade which has a negative impact on their economies. The prices of primary products
      are determined by the world market this means that the Africans do not have a say in the pricing of
      their products. Many of the countries therefore end up getting very little money for their primary
      products yet they pay much more for the industrial products. The challenge therefore is to ensure a
      balance is maintained. The issue of land distribution, increase in population, the need for fuel
      especially petroleum are also problems. Emphasis on cash crops has led to a decrease in the amount
      of land dedicated to food crops. Foreign debt is another major challenge.

      If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

23.   With reference to two regional organizations, explain why they were founded and how they
      have benefited the member states.

      Candidates can choose the East African Community, Economic Community of West African States
      or South Africa Development Cooperation Conference. First of all, the aims of the organization
      must be clearly explained. Candidates should then give concrete examples of membership and how
      member states have benefited, socially, economically, culturally and politically from being
      members of such organizations. There has been cultural exchange between member states; trade
      has also become much easier for citizens of the countries involved. Education opportunities are
      also shared and this has contributed to academic developments in the regions concerned. The
      improvement of transport and communication systems must also be explained focusing on their
      benefits. Candidates should also mention the fact that these organizations were formed to tackle the
      issues that the Organization of African Unity had either failed to solve, or issues that were unique to
      specific regions. Smaller organizations would therefore be able to focus on issues relevant to their
      specific regions. Candidates should also be able to identify any key players in the organizations
      who influence decisions.

      If only one regional organization is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


24.   Discuss the objectives of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its successes and
      failures with reference to any two African countries studied.

      The objectives of the OAU must be discussed, two countries identified and specific examples of
      successes and failures discussed. The OAU was founded in 1963 so as to provide a forum for the
      newly independent states to discuss common problems e.g. border issues, conflicts between
      member states, disaster situations.

      Its major aim was to promote cooperation, economical and political understanding between member
      states. Another aim was also to sort out conflict between member countries and also to help with
      the decolonization process. The Organization of African Unity was formed to protect countries
      from outside interference. Candidates should therefore indicate to what extent the OAU has
      achieved its aims.

      Candidates can mention that OAU helped in the freeing of the many countries from colonial rule.
      Through the OAU, countries have been encouraged to give refuge to nationalist organizations
      which were forced into exile. It should be mentioned that fighting against foreign interference was
      difficult for the OAU especially during the cold war where sections of Africa like Congo, Angola
      and Ethiopia were drawn into the conflict between the superpowers.

      It was able to achieve some of its objectives but failed in some cases because of it not having power
      to enforce its resolutions. There is nothing much OAU can do to a member who has refused to
      adhere to the rules; sanctions do not always work too well. The cold war, poverty and political
      differences in some of the countries made its work difficult. Its success in the attainment of
      independence of some countries e.g. Portuguese territories, Namibia, needs to be noted.

      Failures of the OAU can be seen in the cases of Spanish Sahara and Eritrea.

      If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
