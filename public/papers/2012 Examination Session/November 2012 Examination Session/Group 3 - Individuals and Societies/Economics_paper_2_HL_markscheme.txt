In addition to the assessment criteria, use the paper-specific markscheme below. Award up to the
maximum marks indicated. Each question is worth [10 marks].

1.       Using a production possibility curve, explain the problem of scarcity faced by all societies.

         Candidates may include:
         • a definition of a production possibility curve
         • a definition of opportunity cost
         • an explanation of the problem of scarcity (unlimited wants, limited resources, choice and
           opportunity costs)
         • examples of limited resources: land, labor, capital and entrepreneurship
         • use of a PPC diagram with an appropriate choice of goods (any two competing goods would be
           acceptable)
         • use of the PPC to illustrate how, when the economy lies on the curve, increasing the production
           of one good would necessarily entail a decrease in the production of the other, as resources
           are limited
         • examples of trade-offs faced by societies.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.

         • a definition of a buffer stock scheme
         • an explanation of a buffer stock scheme as a means of stabilizing the price of a commodity
         • use of a diagram showing a range of minimum and maximum prices allowed by the scheme
         • an explanation of how the buffer stock would function. It would be enough to outline any two
           of the following points:
           – if the equilibrium price changes within the predetermined range, the administrative body
              would take no action
           – if the equilibrium price falls short of the minimum price, the government would increase the
              demand by buying
           – if the price exceeds the maximum, the administrative body would release stocks to increase
              supply
         • difficulties associated with buffer stock management, e.g. a build up of surpluses
         • examples of buffer stock schemes.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.

3.   Using at least one diagram, explain how firms operating in monopolistic competition will
     make normal profit (zero economic profit) in the long run.

     Candidates may include:
     • a definition of long run
     • a definition of normal profit (zero economic profit)
     • an explanation of the characteristics of firms in monopolistic competition
     • an explanation of the short run profit maximizing output of a firm operating in monopolistic
       competition, with the firm making either abnormal profit or loss
     • an explanation of how free entry in the long run, will result in a leftward shift in the demand
       curve facing the monopolistically competitive firm when existing firms are making abnormal
       profit in the short run
     • an explanation of how free exit in the long run, will result in a rightward shift in the demand
       curve facing the monopolistically competitive firm when existing firms are making losses in the
       short run

       normal profit in the long run

       short run
     • use of a diagram showing the long run equilibrium where the firm earns normal profit
     • examples of monopolistically competitive firms.

     Candidates need not examine both abnormal profit and loss scenarios; an explanation of one or the
     other is enough for full marks.

     Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
     should be rewarded.

         Candidates may include:
         • a definition of a single currency
         • an explanation of the various disadvantages associated with the adoption of a single currency:
           – the loss of independent monetary policy as an economic tool
           – the loss of the self-correcting mechanism, associated with a free-floating exchange rate,
              in the BOP
           – the pressures and difficulties associated with monetary integration, e.g. the interest rate
              adopted by the common central bank may not suit the needs of every single country within the
              union
           – the ability to use fiscal policy could be bound by common policy agreements (e.g. EU
              stability and growth pact)
           – countries with high inflation could export it to the rest of the currency area
           – one-off transition costs
         • an example of a single currency, e.g. the euro, and any disadvantage associated with its adoption.

         Candidates who fully develop two disadvantages may be awarded full marks.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
         should be rewarded.

6.   Explain how a significant fall in the price of commodities (raw materials) would affect the
     economy of a less developed country.

     Candidates may include:
     • a definition of a less developed country
     • an explanation of how a fall in the price of export commodities may result in a fall in revenues
       from exports due to the price inelasticity of demand of primary products
     • the impact on the economy depends on the proportion of exports that are primary
     • less developed countries export largely unprocessed primary products and are therefore more
       sensitive to price movements than if exports were processed
     • impact on less developed countries’ levels of employment, growth and government revenue
     • the effect of lower commodity prices on the terms of trade and the consequences of an adverse
       shift in the terms of trade
     • an explanation of how a fall in the price of imported commodities would result in lower
       import payments, and hence have positive effects on cost-push inflation and the current account
     • examples of countries that were affected by a fall in the price of commodities.

     Candidates who fully develop two effects of falling commodity prices on the economy, or who fully
     develop one effect but show how two aspects of the economy are affected as a result, may be
     awarded full marks.

     Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate,
     should be rewarded.
