Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

1.   Health and dentistry

     (a)   (i)    Describe one difference between a local area network (LAN) and a wide
                  area network (WAN).                                                   [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   LAN is within close proximity, (ie home, office, same building or group
                    of buildings close together), whereas a WAN is not restricted to a
                    geographical area
                   WAN connects several LANs together
                   they use different protocols. A LAN transmits to other devices within the
                    network, whereas a WAN uses point to point transmissions between
                    nodes
                   LAN has a high transfer rate, WAN is much slower.

                  Award [1 mark] for identifying one difference and an additional [1 mark]
                  for a brief description up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   The upgraded IT system is a LAN based on a client/server network.
                  Outline the relationship between the client and the server in the
                  upgraded IT system.                                               [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   the server hosts information and programs that are shared to the clients
                    (computers used in the examination rooms by dental hygienist/dentist)
                   the client (computer used by the dental hygienist/dentist) makes a request
                    to the server
                   the server fulfills the request.

                  Award [1 mark] for any aspect of the relationship between the client and the
                  server that is identified. Award an additional [1 mark] if the relationship
                  between the two is outlined.
                                      –5–                N12/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(iii) The developers of the upgraded IT system own the intellectual property
      rights for the system. Define the term intellectual property.          [2 marks]

     Answers may include:
      intellectual property refers to any property that is created using original
       thought
      the creator owns the rights to the artifacts that they created, this includes
       artistic works and ideas
      intellectual property is protected by copyrights, trademarks and patents
      unlike tangible property, rights are not extinguished when the property is
       destroyed
      developers of the IT system own the ideas used in the system (design,
       how it works and what it does). No other developer can create a system
       with these same ideas.

     Award [1 mark] for each of the points stated above up to a maximum of
     [2 marks].
                                             –6–                 N12/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Analyse the impacts of implementing the upgraded IT system for the dentist.             [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       access to data – transfer data from paper records to electronic will make access
        easier to data
       access to data – dentist and his staff have faster access to a patient’s electronic
        chart than it is to locate a patient’s paper chart
       queries – dentist will be able to do online search queries for patient information
       simulations – dentist can use the new IT system to show before and after
        simulations so patients can see what their teeth will look like once a procedure
        is completed, or what it will look like if they don’t have a procedure done
       cost – dentist will need to provide training for all office staff, which can be
        costly and time is needed to implement this new system
       backup – if system malfunctions (power outage, server crash, virus), dentist
        requires a backup plan will need to be in place to access patient records
       updates – once the system has been installed, the dentist may want to keep up
        with updates and this might have a cost / involve a risk of having to adapt to
        great changes / assume mistakes of the newer and not tried versions.

      Award marks for impacts for the dentist.

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of
      the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4 marks]
      A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples are used
      within the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the
      response.

      [5–6 marks]
      A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates thorough
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples are used
      throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the
      response.

(c)   To what extent should dentists use simulation software to determine future
      treatment for their patients?                                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       dentists can show patients what will happen if they don’t take care of their
        teeth
       dentists can show how a certain procedure could correct their current problem
        with their teeth
       simulations cannot account for all unexpected complications
       simulations can persuade patients into taking care of the situation now, rather
        than later
       if dentists enter incorrect data into the simulation, then the output will not be
        reliable and the patient can be given incorrect information.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

                  Answers may include:
                   consistency – user cannot input different numbers or formats/prevents
                    users from making mistakes
                   preset values – limits users choices to those provided
                   simplifies process – values are already provided/select options is faster
                    than typing

      Answers may include:
      Streaming
       must be online to read the book, constant internet access
       if connection is slow, may have difficulty reading, turning pages
       if connection is lost, unable to read book
       can get access to up-to-date books.
       if the text has links (ie to websites, additional content material), these may be
         followed while reading the online version
       if users are making comments to passages in the book these will be updated
         online and the online reader will be able to access them at any time
       large books may be read online without having to worry about the amount of
         storage space they might take.

      Downloading
       only need to have internet access long enough to download book
       can read the book in areas without internet access once downloaded

              convenience/comfort – turn heat/air conditioning on shortly before you
               get home – your home is at the required temperature when you arrive
              security – video surveillance – can see for yourself what is happening in
               and around your home.

             [1 mark]
             A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the

             [2–3 marks]
             A reasonable explanation of the problems that may arise from using this to
             control your home. The answer may be unbalanced and lack appropriate
             reasoning at the lower end of the band.

             [4 marks]
             A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of why this would be an efficient
             way to control your home.

      (ii)   Explain one difference between the access to a WiFi and a 3G mobile
             network.                                                            [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
              range – WiFi is limited to a small area or hot spot within a small region,
               whereas 3G is a broad signal available in a wider area
              coverage – WiFi must be within range of a router, usually indoors or a
               confined area where signals can sometimes be interrupted by other
               devices, whereas 3G can be outside and is available in remote areas
              cost – WiFi is free in many hot spots, whereas with 3G there are costs
               incurred through a local company.

             Award [1 mark] for one reason identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate
             explanation of that reason up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   When setting up software and accessing web sites such as Amazon, the user is
      often given a choice of two options:
       remain permanently logged in
       require the username and password to be entered every time.

      Justify the option you would choose when using a computer to access a
      website from home.                                                    [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Permanently logged in:
       so you do not have to type in credentials to gain access quicker
       if you want others to access information on your system
       your own personal computer, no need to logout.

      Log in each time:
       security – no one can gain access without your login credentials
       ensures you don’t forget your password over time
       multi-users – if others use the machine, you would want them to log in as
        themselves
       networked computer – required personal login each time.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

(b)   Teachers find the on-screen instructions for changing settings from 2D mode
      to 3D mode very complicated and time-consuming. For example, the teacher
      must choose the following menu items each time they want to use 3D:

      Menu > Detailed Menu > Image > Advanced Menu > 3D Mode > On

      Analyse two IT methods of providing training for teachers to use the software
      and hardware linked to the new 3D system.                                     [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Face-to-face training:
       requires attendance in person
       can interact in person with instructor
       can ask questions directly to instructor.

      Online training:
       flexibility – do not have to be present at a specific time
       convenience – do not have to be present at a specific location
       can often review online training several times
       can often interact with instructor via discussions
       can be individualized to user’s needs – can skip or redo steps when required.

      Do not accept reading a manual, as it is not an IT method.

      [1–2 marks]
      The candidate conveys a limited understanding of the difference between face-to-
      face and online training. The examples compared will be identified or partially
      described in isolation.

      [3–4 marks]
      The candidate conveys some understanding of the difference between face-to-face
      and online training, but the two ways would have been described in isolation.

(c)   Other schools are investigating this 3D technology for their classrooms.
      Discuss whether they should invest in this system.                       [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       cost – new equipment will need to be purchased
       availability of resources – special resources and software will need to be
        purchased
       ease of use – need to ensure it is easy to use for all teachers
       engaging – new technologies will be of greater interest to students
       better understanding – 3D technology allows students to see from various
        perspectives and learn more from these models.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of VOIP.                                           [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   a telephone connection over the internet
                   audio data is sent digitally over the internet
                   a system for converting analogue signals to digital so that telephone calls
                    can be made over the internet.

                  Award [1 mark] for each characteristic identified up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].

           (ii)   Define the term protocol.                                                       [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   set of rules/standards/instructions
                   protocols determine specific tasks (ie error checking, method of data
                    compression, when the receiving device has received all of the data,
                    when the sending device has completed the transmission of data)
                   governs the transmission of data
                   protocols specify interactions between devices
                   specific example of protocol (ie FTP).

                  Award [1 mark] for each of the points stated above up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].

           (iii) State two stages where a Skype call can be blocked from reaching the
                 intended recipient.                                                  [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:

(b)   Analyse the decision of some countries to ban services such as Skype.             [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages for the government:
       economic – countries will lose money if business is taken away from national
        telecom companies
       increased government control over calls and records that happen within their
        country through national telecom companies
       security – data can be more easily intercepted
       reduce the demands caused by Skype on Internet service (ie bandwidth).

      Disadvantages for the government:
       restriction of users’ communication promotes illegal providers of Skype
        to emerge.

      Advantages for the user:
       better national telecom services may emerge because all citizens must use
        these services.

      Disadvantages for the user:
       users could have no alternative to paying excessive fees charged by national
        telecom companies
       anyone attempting to by-pass the law will face consequences such as
        imprisonment or fines
       users may need to travel to neighbouring countries that do not have such
        restrictions to use Skype
       encryption of telephone communication is no longer possible (whereas Skype is
        encrypted so governments do not have easy access to the data).

(c)   In most countries the use of VOIP is legal. Discuss the decision of a business
      in these countries to use VOIP services instead of a conventional
      phone system.                                                                  [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       low cost – can make long distance calls for free, anywhere in the world via
        VOIP
       portable and convenient – can make calls anywhere there is an internet
        connection by signing into your VOIP account
       added features – caller ID, call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail at no charge
        unlike conventional phone systems
       sharing resources – can send picture and documents while you are talking on
        the phone since it uses data lines
       virtual phone number – you can choose a phone number with an area code
        different from where you reside
       group conversations – on a traditional phone line, only two persons can speak
        at a time. With VOIP, you can setup a conference with a whole team
        communicating in real time
       power – internet based phones need power, so they will not work during a
        power outage unlike conventional phones
       emergency calls – emergency services cannot trace the location of a call
        (dangerous if you can’t talk in an emergency) if it is on a data line such
        as VOIP
       sound quality – voice data sent across the internet can experience dropped data
        packets which would cause short periods of silence
       video quality – delay in the video resulting from technical limitations (ie low
        bandwidth either by the sender or receiver, incorrect settings)
       reliability – the distance and speed of the connection affects the reliability of
        the sound arriving
       bandwidth – too much traffic on a network can cause a drop in audio data when
        using VOIP
       security – VOIP may not be as secure as a regular telephone service; phone
        calls may be intercepted as they are transmitted over the internet.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.
