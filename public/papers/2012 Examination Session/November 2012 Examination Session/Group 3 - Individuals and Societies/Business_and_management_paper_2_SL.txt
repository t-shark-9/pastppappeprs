Answer one question from this section.

1.    Wavin’ Surfboards (WS)

      Wavin’ Surfboards (WS ) manufactures surfboards. The business
      was founded in 1978 by Brent Bass who operated it as a
      sole trader. In 1991, after years of sales growth and employing
      many employees, Brent changed WS into a private limited
      company. The growth in scale of operation was a challenge
      for Brent, who had a laissez-faire leadership style. He loved
      surfing and as a young person he started producing and selling
      surfboards at his home. He had not received any business training.
      As the business grew Brent struggled to develop the business
      and management skills necessary to operate the business.

      Due to the high quality and popularity of the surfboards, sales
      continued to increase. Brent’s accountant believes that the
      company will need a new larger building in two years. The span
      of control within the company is currently wide, and increasing
      the number of units (surfboards) produced would require
      employing more managers. For Brent, this would mean spending [Source: http://www.grainsurfboards.com/,

      more time supervising managers and less time producing and
      promoting surfboards. Brent would also have to decide whether to recruit the new managers
      internally or externally.

      Brent’s accountant prepared a comparison of the current and proposed new scale of operation.

2.    Woolman Windows (WW)

      Woolman Windows (WW ) manufactures windows for houses. The windows are sold to suppliers of
      building materials in Canada. WW’s windows have two pieces of glass sealed in a wooden frame
      with a special glue that prevents any air from passing through. The windows are energy-efficient.
      In addition, moisture never appears between the two pieces of glass, a problem common to many
      other energy-efficient windows. The WW brand is widely recognized in the residential construction
      industry in Canada.

      Because of the housing crisis in North America, WW has seen its sales fall and its financial position
      deteriorate.

      WW manufactures only standard-sized windows using flow production. WW offers trade credit* with
      payment in 30 days. However, WW is considering taking “special orders”, that is, to manufacture
      windows that are not standard-sized. Doing so might be profitable if the number of windows
      per special order were a minimum of 100 windows (break-even point). WW would manufacture
      special orders using batch production. For special orders, the buyer would pay 50 % upon
      placing the order and the remainder upon delivery. The disadvantage is that an additional employee
      would have to be employed to plan the production process for each special order. WW is uncertain
      if special-order sales will be sufficient to cover the cost of the recruitment and training of the
      new employee.

      * trade credit: credit extended to a business from its suppliers. Trade credit is usually listed on the balance sheet of a
            business as “creditors” or, in some countries, “accounts payable”.

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Sokol restaurant

      Sokol is a well-established traditional restaurant in a village in Slovenia. Sokol has a new owner,
      Andrej Marinić. Andrej conducted some market research in order to analyse Sokol’s business
      environment and reached the following conclusions:
      • Sokol has a good market share: last year, it served 12 000 out of the 60 000 meals served in total by
        all the restaurants in the village
      • Sokol has two target markets: (i) young locals who want to eat out with friends, (ii) tourists who
        want traditional Slovenian dishes.

      Andrej has constructed a position map* using the two axes of price (cheap or expensive) and styles of
      food (traditional or modern). The research showed that Sokol is perceived as cheap and traditional.
      Sokol’s three main competitors have the following characteristics:
      • Restaurant A: very expensive and very modern
      • Restaurant B: cheap and traditional
      • Restaurant C: cheap and modern.

      The position map helps Andrej identify a new business opportunity: keeping the same traditional
      style but changing to a more expensive, exclusive, up-market image. Sokol would target two new
      market segments: (i) locals for special occasions such as family celebrations, (ii) tourists who are
      prepared to pay higher-than-average prices.

      Andrej has three options:
      1. To set up a joint venture with a five-star hotel that is to open in the nearby village.
      2. To set up a strategic alliance with Restaurant A. The manager of Restaurant A is keen to
         collaborate in events such as the annual village festival.
      3. To merge with Restaurant B, as they are the only two restaurants serving traditional
         Slovenian dishes. This merger, however, would result in redundancy (lay-off) for some employees,
         which would create negative publicity in the village.

4.    Procter & Gamble (P&G) and the dry cleaning* industry

      Procter & Gamble (P&G) is a multinational company that manufactures a wide range of products
      and has global sales of US$80 billion. In the United States (US), P&G has now entered the
      dry cleaning industry, which is dominated by small independent, locally-owned businesses.
      “Tide Dry Cleaners®” is named after its best-selling soap (detergent) for washing clothes, Tide.
      P&G hopes to attract customers into its franchise stores with its well-known soap brand and then
      retain them with superior service.

      According to research conducted by market analysts, consumers think that independent dry cleaners:
      • are inconsistent in the service they provide
      • have inconvenient opening hours
      • rarely display prices
      • are dirty, hot and smell of chemicals.

      Tide Dry Cleaners® aims to promote a different image. The franchises are larger than most
      independent dry cleaners and have longer opening hours. They are painted in the same bright orange
      colour as Tide’s soap packaging. The dry cleaning is done onsite, so service is quicker. Tide soap
      with its well-known long-lasting fresh scent is always used to dry-clean the clothes. The premises are
      kept clean, well-ventilated, cool and smelling of Tide soap.

      Because competition is fierce, all Tide Dry Cleaners® offer discounts and below the line promotion.
      Already, many independent dry cleaners are concerned about the competition from the new
      Tide Dry Cleaners® franchises. One independent dry cleaner recently experienced a 50 % decrease in
      sales after a new Tide Dry Cleaners® franchise opened nearby. In the past, dry cleaning chains have
      had difficulty competing with independent stores, due to diseconomies of scale.

5.    Starbucks® and Tata Coffee

      Starbucks® is a multinational coffee shop chain based in the United States (US). Starbucks® is in
      discussions with Tata Coffee, an Indian company, about opening Starbucks® coffee shops in the
      fast-growing Indian market. The Indian government limits the entry of foreign-owned retail chains
      into India.

      Tata Coffee grows and sells its own coffee. It is owned by Tata Group, the largest Indian business
      conglomerate*. Starbucks® and Tata Coffee are considering forming a strategic alliance or a
      joint venture. For the past seven years, the two companies have done business with each other.
      Starbucks® has purchased coffee from various suppliers in India (for its coffee shops in Europe and
      the US), including from Tata Coffee.

      Forming a strategic alliance or a joint venture with Tata Coffee will allow Starbucks® to enter the
      Indian market. Additional advantages for Starbucks® include:
      • Starbucks® could open coffee shops inside hotels of the Tata Group’s nationwide hotel chain
      • Tata Group would consider allowing Starbucks® to open coffee shops in the numerous retail chains
         that it owns.

      Coffee has long been popular in southern India but not in the north. Over the past decade, however,
      consumption of coffee in the north has increased significantly, as new coffee shop chains with more
      choice, appeal to young Indians with disposable income. India (with its population of over 1 billion)
      is developing fast (with a growth rate of 8 % of its GDP this year). Starbucks® has carried out research
      and found that the global brand name “Starbucks®” is already well-known in India, although there are
