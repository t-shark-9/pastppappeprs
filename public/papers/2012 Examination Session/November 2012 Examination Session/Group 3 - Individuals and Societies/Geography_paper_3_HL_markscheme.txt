1.   (a)   Using examples, explain the strengths and weaknesses of the concept of
           food miles.                                                                          [10 marks]

           Food miles can be defined as a measure of the distance food travels from its
           source to the consumer. This can be given either in units of actual distance or
           of energy consumed during transport.

           The strengths of the concept include: drawing awareness to the extreme
           distance travelled by some produce, thereby empowering consumers to make
           informed choices. This can be linked with broader concerns with carbon
           footprint size and ecological footprint size, especially in the context of air
           freight. Expected examples are food journeys that appear excessive, especially
           when produce that is also locally available is being shipped across continents
           (e.g. south American asparagus flown to the UK, or similar examples). Allow
           a broad interpretation of “food” e.g. credit discussion of bottled water from Fiji
           being shipped to Europe and USA.

           A critical explanation of the concept of food miles ought to also recognize it is
           a crude concept with many weaknesses. Distance travelled is only one
           foot-printing measure. Locally-produced food can use excessive energy inputs
           too e.g. hot-houses. It is hard to quantify food miles for processed or prepared
           foods with multiple ingredients. Rejecting food from distant places impacts on
           farmers’ livelihoods (and many fair trade products have high food miles
           attached to them).

           An account that addresses the costs and benefits of long-distance food sourcing,
           rather than the concept of food miles (i.e. the notion that distance is a reliable
           proxy for energy consumption/a benchmark for ethical consumerism), may
           reach the border of band C/D. Other misinterpretations may be marked in a
           similarly positive way, provided “food miles” is the clear focus of the answer,
           and examples are provided.

           At band D, expect some strengths and weaknesses to have been identified and
           explained using examples, but do not expect balance. For band E there should
           be proper consideration of weaknesses as well as strengths, i.e. a critical
           explanation of the concept of food miles has been offered.

(b)   “Global interactions are mainly driven by the actions of transnational
      corporations (TNCs).” Discuss this statement.                                        [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      TNCs are key actors who spread consumerism [Guide 5.2] and also build
      global production networks through practices such as outsourcing
      [Guide 3.3 and 4.2]. Their primary motive is profit-making which provides a
      strong driving force, as the statement suggests. It is hard to imagine a form of
      globalization without global capitalism and TNCs are arguably globalization’s
      “architects”: the financial flows they generate are of primary importance
      [Guide 3.1]. They have built up economic activity in cores / global hubs
      [Guide 1.2], attracting migrants as part of local and global backwash processes.
      The global map of economic activity and wealth strongly mirrors the
      geography of TNCs. Some TNCs are arguably more powerful, and
      demonstrably more wealthy, than some nation states [Guide 6.1].

      TNCs innovate glocally as part of their growth strategy [Guide 7.1 and 7.2]
      and this provides an extra dimension to global interactions (which include
      social, cultural and political interactions). TNCs can be seen to have a role too,
      as internet service providers [Guide 2.2] and major media and branded
      corporations (e.g. Disney) [Guide 5.2].

      The alternate viewpoint is that TNCs are not acting alone and other actors have
      a role in shaping global interactions. These include:

      • Multi-governmental organizations (MGOs) [Guide 6.1 and 3.1] who design
        the legal infrastructure for investment without which TNCs could not
        operate on a global scale as effectively – the provision of SEZs (special
        economic zones) is also very important e.g. for China to attract FDI.
      • The Washington IMF-led neo-liberal project / global harmonization
        e.g. through SAPs (structural adjustment programmes) / guiding actions of
        WTO/World Bank are all an important part of the economic
        counter-argument [Guide 3.1].

      More broadly, technology could be cast as an autonomous actor that has its
      own role to play [Guide 2.2 and 3.2] and helps drive cultural interactions
      [Guide 5.1] e.g. growth of Facebook.

      High-scoring answers may show that the power of TNCs is exercised
      alongside/in tandem with political power (the idea that economic globalization
      has been led by the USA acting as a “superpower” in the best interests of its
      TNCs) or they may offer alternate evaluative summaries that show equal
      conceptual or critical awareness.

      Answers that address both sides of the argument are likely to reach band D. To
      reach band E, there should also be balance and some sophisticated analysis.

2.   (a)   Using one or more examples, analyse the impact of diasporas on local
           cultures.                                                                           [10 marks]

           “Diaspora” describes a scattered community of common ancestry. Diaspora
           can be a product of migration or of territorial disintegration leaving a cultural
           group straddling different national borders. Likely examples for analysis will
           include: Polish, Chinese, Jewish, Indian, Irish, Scottish, English, Caribbean,
           Nigerian diasporas – but there are of course many other possibilities. Credit
           should be given to answers that provide clear details of the global diaspora
           pattern(s).

           The preservation of migrant culture is a common diaspora trait, albeit in
           hybridized or fossilized forms, both of which may be explored, depending on
           the view taken of what “local culture” means. The adoption of minority
           diaspora traits by a host country culture (e.g. US “melting pot” ideas)
           is another approach.

           The answer could discuss how the local culture of the origin country
           (e.g. Ireland, Poland) may have been affected e.g. “fossilization” of the tourist
           industry. Another approach might be to address the great variability in local
           cultural forms for different parts of a diaspora (e.g. comparing Jewish culture
           in the UK with that of the USA).

           The approach taken will depend on the example(s) used and each answer
           should be credited in terms of its merits and should not be negatively marked if
           many of the themes suggested by this markscheme are not present but other
           valid content is provided.

           At the border of band C/D, the focus on diaspora may still be insecure (e.g.
           concept of scattered population is not fully understood, or the answer is more
           concerned with the impacts of a simple migration flow), but the focus on
           cultural impacts should be secure (alternatively, the response may have a good
           grasp of what diaspora is but fails to focus on culture).

           At the border of band D/E, expect some range of impacts to be addressed for a
           named and understood diaspora. At band E, the diaspora concept ought to be
           handled well (may consider cultural impacts for source and various hosts, or
           compares the cultural traits of different regional communities within the global
           diaspora).

(b)   “Globalization is unstoppable.” Discuss this statement.                            [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Globalization can be analysed as a purely economic set of processes or as a
      broader concept that embraces ideas of cultural and political change also.
      Either approach is acceptable. Globalization has accelerated over time as
      different indexes of globalization (Kearney, Kof) show [Guide 1.1] although
      the credit crunch / global slowdown may have shaken the faith of
      hyper-globalizers since 2008. Technology continues to develop, furthering
      possibilities for economic and social integration at different scales
      [Guide 2.1 and 2.2]. Companies are quick to exploit technical innovations and
      network growth seems certain to continue [Guide 3.3].

      There are many other themes that can be explored which can be linked with the
      idea of globalization as a continuing trend e.g. lax labour/safety/environmental
      laws will continue to attract TNC operations to some places, further globalizing
      economic activity [Guide 4.2]. The economic clout of TNCs also means
      further growth of successful firms through mergers and acquisitions. The trend
      for MGOs is also likely for a variety of reasons [Guide 6.1].

      The other side of the debate looks at possible reasons why globalization might
      be challenged / slow down (albeit temporarily) – and there are internal and
      external pressures that could possibly be considered. The former includes the
      global credit crunch / sub-prime crisis and consequent collapse of key financial
      TNCs, a problem which subsequently escalated into a threat to sovereign states
      within the global core (Iceland, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). External threats
      include resistance movements (anti-globalization movements) as well as the
      fact that the strong Indo-Chinese dimensions to 21st century global economic
      growth could be seen as a threat to globalization as a project that is
      synonymous with Americanization.

      Resistance could also be mounted against further losses to sovereignty and
      independence posed by the growth of MGOs [Guide 6.2, 7.3 and 7.4].

      Responses must address both sides of the argument at band D. For band E
      expect balance and a proper, critical and/or evidence-based evaluation of the
      statement.

3.   (a)   Explain what is meant by time–space convergence.                                    [10 marks]

           The key idea is that of a “shrinking world” thanks to technological innovation
           over time. Expect some explanation of the technologies that enable this change
           and empirical evidence to support (e.g. time taken to circumnavigate the
           world, etc.). This may be shown in diagrammatic form and should be credited.

           Other approaches to explanation might include an analysis of the range of
           flows / global interactions that are enabled by different technologies (and the
           specific impacts they bring as aspects of the convergence e.g. cultural dilution,
           McDonaldization or growth of “global village”).

           Good answers may recognize the uneven nature of time–space compression
           (not all people and places experience it to the same extent; some places have
           “opted-out” of globalization, etc.).

           At band C, answers may be descriptive of reduced times for travel (provide
           facts about reducing sailing times, etc.) without addressing the concept of
           time–space convergence very explicitly; or may provide a superficial account
           of the concept but without much real evidence to ground the explanation.

           For bands D and E, answers will be focused on both dimensions of space and
           time (global technologies bring places/people nearer together by reducing the
           time taken for instantaneous interactions/flows to occur) and the explanation
           well supported with examples. Band E answers may additionally show
           especially adroit handling of the concept / employ very good terminology.

(b)   “Global interactions result in some form of environmental damage being
      experienced everywhere.” Discuss this statement.                                     [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Global interactions can include FDI by TNCs, information flows, migrants, and
      trade and commodity flows [Guide 3.1, 3.2, 3.3]. Specific activities,
      e.g. agro-industrialization of peripheral regions or raw material extraction
      (including energy sources) or TNC operations in different territories are
      relevant activities that may have a global dimension and constitute interactions
      [Guide 4.1, 4.2].

      In discussing “everywhere”, good answers may consider whether a geographic
      pattern of damage can be identified (i.e. linked to trade routes, coastlines; or a
      developmental pattern e.g. idea of excessive impacts for LEDCs rather than
      MEDCs); or whether some areas manage to escape certain kinds of damage
      (related perhaps to the “wilderness” concept).

      Themes may include:
      • the pattern for individual transboundary pollution events [Guide 4.3]
      • excessively damaging impacts for poorly regulated LEDCs [Guide 4.2]
      • major shipping routes and pollution e.g. oil spills and other pollution linked
        with global interactions, e.g. Niger delta oil fields in Nigeria [Guide 4.3]
      • e-waste in poor countries [Guide 4.2]
      • “non-globalised”, “untouched” or wilderness regions [Guide 7.4]
      • increased protection thanks to NGOs/civil society organizations e.g.
        Greenpeace [Guide 4.3]
      • possible impacts of global tourist flows on environments [Guide 5.1].

      Given that all flows have a carbon footprint – even internet use and Google
      searches – links may be made with climate change science and perhaps the
      extent of its impacts e.g. greater warming for Arctic regions.

      There may be alternate approaches and these should be credited. For bands
      D and E, some range of interactions must be addressed. There should be some
      explicit evaluation, especially at band E, of what is meant by “everywhere” (i.e.
      arguing some places are worse-affected than others, or some places have
      escaped from, or are protected from, the environmental harm global
      interactions may bring).
