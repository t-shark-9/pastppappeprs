Answer two questions from this section.

1.    (a)   General Diane Pierce uses a situational leadership style (lines 33–34). Identify
            four key features of a situational leadership style.                               [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain why General Diane Pierce decided to order Colonel Michael Donovan

      (c)   General Diane Pierce decided to use UWP resources to build either a new
            hospital or a new university campus. Using Maslow’s motivation theory,
            analyse the impact of this decision on both the local population and
            “the Olive Hats”.                                                                  [7 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for Kos Palouk of pursuing
            Option 2 (lines 150–152).                                                          [7 marks]


3.    (a)   General Diane Pierce needs to remotivate her troops but cannot offer any
            financial rewards (lines 39–41). Describe two non-financial rewards that she
            could use.                                                                         [4 marks]

                                               SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    General Diane Pierce concluded that building a hospital was a better option than building a university.

      The situation around Beral was deteriorating (Item 1). Soon the city would be unable to obtain
      sufficient food supplies.   Moreover, the loss of control of the area surrounding Beral would
      psychologically impact on the residents, perhaps causing greater resistance to the UWP Mission.
      General Pierce decided to increase the frequency of the UWP patrols in the UWP-protected area.
      This, however, would require several changes to the overall plan for the UWP Mission in Beral.
      With an increase in the frequency of patrols, fewer troops would be available for the construction
      project.

      General Pierce instructed Colonel Michael Donovan to prepare a new critical path analysis.
      He developed two possible timetables and approaches to constructing the hospital (Items 2 and 3).
      Either way, completing the project would take longer than 30 weeks as originally planned.
      Colonel Donovan also recommended a change to the workforce planning scheme, shifting from
      a traditional construction approach where the construction team moves from one job to the next
      sequentially; to a cell production approach where smaller teams work simultaneously on different
      jobs (Item 5). He warned, however, that regardless of the approach taken, building the hospital under
      the new circumstances would put huge physical and mental pressure on the troops. In light of the
      deteriorating situation in Beral, Colonel Donovan’s warnings, and of recent demographic data about
      Loyka (Item 6), General Pierce had to re-evaluate her strategy of building a hospital.


      (a)   Identify two factors that may affect the UWP’s workforce planning in Beral.            [2 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Using information from Item 3, copy and complete into your answer
                   booklet the network diagram in Item 4 for activities A to H and identify
                   the critical path for the construction of the hospital.                         [5 marks]

		          (ii)   With reference to the case study, explain one disadvantage of using a
                   critical path analysis.                                                         [2 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the use of a cell production approach for the construction of the hospital.    [9 marks]

      (d)   Using information contained in the case study, Items 1 to 6, and a force field
            analysis (no numerical weightings are required for your forces), evaluate
            General Diane Pierce’s strategic decision to build the hospital.                      [12 marks]

Additional Information

Item 1: Extract from Beral Courier, a local newspaper

Rumours of increased violence outside the UWP-protected area were recently confirmed by the office
of the local governor. Attacks against vehicles on roads near local towns such as Bosca, Boussena,
Gana and Saura have been confirmed by local police.   One driver, who was returning from Saura,
was seriously injured. In another instance, there was severe damage to a road, causing vehicles to take a
different route, which doubled the travel time. The UWP Mission has announced its intention to increase
UWP patrols in the area.

The impact of the increased violence has had an immediate impact on local Beral shops, which reported
shortages of produce.


Item 2: Two possible timetables and approaches to constructing the hospital

Option 1: Traditional construction approach                Option 2: Cell production approach (one cell)
Estimated construction time: 37 weeks                      Estimated construction time: 31 weeks
Sequence of tasks:                                         Sequence of tasks: See Item 3 (below)
i. Site preparation (6 weeks)
ii. Construction of exterior walls and roof (18 weeks)
iii. Construction of interior walls, painting and flooring
     (12 weeks)
iv. Cleaning (1 week)


Item 3: Sequence of tasks for cell production approach (Option 2 above)

Tasks                      Estimated duration (weeks)
A                                      9
B (must follow A)                      9
C (must follow A)                      6
D (must follow B and C)                4
E (must follow B and C)                2
F (must follow D)                      6
G (must follow E)                      3
H (must follow F and G)                3

Item 4: Critical path analysis for cell production approach

Network diagram for one cell A–H (each cell (hospital wing) takes the same time to construct).

Do not write your answers to 5(b)(i) on this page.




Item 5: Extract of a memo from Colonel Michael Donovan to General Diane Pierce regarding
        workforce planning

By changing from a traditional construction approach to a cell production approach, the total time taken
to complete the hospital can be shortened to 31 weeks. This is one week longer than the original estimate
but still six weeks earlier than the traditional approach.

In a cell production approach, most of the troops would be divided into cell “teams”. Each team would
be responsible for the construction of one wing (cell) of the hospital (Alpha, Beta, Charlie, and Delta).
Although some tasks would have to be done for the entire hospital (such as painting and cleaning), most
tasks will be completed by different cell teams, each building their own wing of the hospital.




There are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach.
