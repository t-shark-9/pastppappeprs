                                             SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe one strength and one weakness of EEB using a straight line
           method of depreciation.                                                            [4 marks]

           The strength(s) of a straight line method of depreciation could include:
            it is a simple method provided Maia, the Finance Manager, knows the initial
             costs, the life expectancy of the asset and possibly the scrap value
            it assumes that the cost of an asset is written off in equal amounts over its
             life hence this method is easy to calculate.

           The weakness(es) of a straight line method of depreciation could include:
            most assets, especially electronic ones like computers and also software
             depreciate more in the early part of their life
            therefore, writing off the same amount of money as opposed to the same
             percentage each year, can provide EEB with misleading figures of net book
             value (higher) and depreciation allowance (lower in the early years).

           Accept any other relevant strength or weakness and description.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1 mark] for a relevant and correct strength/weakness identified and
           [1 mark] for a relevant and correct description with application to EEB, up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

           It is expected that the candidates refer to EEB. Award up to a maximum of
           [3 marks] if there is no reference to the stimulus/EEB.

      working).                                                                         [4 marks]

           In order to calculate the ARR, the net annual return has to be calculated.

           correct answer up to a maximum of [4 marks].
           Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] if the net annual return is not

(e)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for EEB of using the NPV
      method of investment appraisal.                                                    [4 marks]

      Possible advantages of the NPV method could include:
      Maia, the Finance Director will incorporate future earnings into today’s value.
      It is a more accurate method as the decision is made in the present while the
      return is predicted for the future. Normally money in the future is worth less
      than the current value, so Maia can calculate the present value of the return on
      investment taking into account the effect of interest rates and time. If the NPV
      is positive the investment should be taken on a financial basis. The other
      methods do not incorporate discounted cash flow. When comparing two or
      more options as in this case, Maia can clearly see that Option A gives the
      highest NPV. Maia can also compare the effects of different discount rates.

      Possible disadvantages of the NPV method could include:
      It might be difficult for Maia to decide on the most accurate discount factor
      especially if the inflation rate and interest rate fluctuate considerably. An
      accurate rate is crucial for EEB. The discount rate of 4 % might not be
      accurate, which may lead to the wrong decision. As with the other methods
      Maia relies on estimated data on the return generated by the investment. Given
      changes in the external environment, especially technological changes, the
      figures are likely to be overestimated. The predicted/estimated figures are
      likely to make the decision taken in the present more favourable.

      Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage and explanation.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for a relevant and correct advantage/disadvantage identified
      and [1 mark] for a relevant and correct explanation with application to EEB,
      up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      Do not credit responses that are generic and refer to the advantages of
      investment appraisal rather than to the use of the NPV method.

(f)   Examine Maia’s choice of Option B.                                                     [6 marks]

      Arguments in support of Maia’s decision to opt for Option B:

      Financial considerations:
      Although the ARR is considerably lower than Option A, 4.75 % is still higher
      than the current discount factor of 4 %, assuming that it is based on the current
      interest or inflation rate in the economy. It is therefore still financially viable.

      The NPV for Option B is positive, hence the investment is viable. However,
      the figure is not very high and is significantly lower than the NPV of Option A.
      Moreover, Maia might have realized that the best investment appraisal method
      should have been the payback period given the rapid change in technology.
      Hence, the favourable financial result of investing in Option A might not have
      impressed Maia that much.

      Non-financial considerations:
      EEB may gain a competitive advantage in the market. The new system can
      potentially be used to develop a USP for EEB. It will enable the company to
      reach a larger volume of customers and to compete globally. EEB is currently
      profitable and has the cash to invest. The significant higher costs of Option B
      are not seen by Maia as a hindrance for EEB. System B is a secure one – a
      very important advantage for an online operator. Other operators reported
      some security issues with Option A. EEB will not have to face frequent
      breakdowns of the software that might endanger its reputation and reduce
      efficiency and quality of service.

      Possible arguments against:
      Option B will also last for 4 years only. EEB will have to update the computer
      system at a further considerable cost in 4 years time anyway. This is the same
      replacement time if Option A is chosen. The remaining employees might be
      unmotivated due to a fear of further redundancy. Given the fact that EEB
      operates in the service sector, employees’ effort and performance is of vital
      importance. A 15 % reduction in employees is a significant one. EEB is
      known for its service quality. This USP may be eroded.

      Accept any other relevant issue for and against.

      It is not expected that the candidates will reach a final judgment. It does look,
      however, that the Finance Director’s attention was paid more to the non-
      financial issues given the comfortable financial situation that EEB is in.

      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced examination of
      two possible arguments for and two possible arguments against Maia’s choice.

      For one relevant argument for and one relevant argument against award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach which includes two issues or

2.   (a)   Outline the importance of the balance sheet to two stakeholder groups of
           BP.                                                                                [4 marks]

           The balance sheet shows the asset structure and the liabilities both short and
           long term of BP and is also a measure of a company’s liquidity and as such can
           be important to a number of stakeholder groups:
            potential shareholders/investors – this may affect their willingness to invest
              in the company. They will be interested in the liquidity position as well as
              the current share capital of BP.
            Management – The Operation Manager may be interested in the amount of
              stock being held, the Finance Manager may be interested in the working
              capital and cash position and will pay particular attention to the amount of
              debtors.
            pressure groups – the asset structure may affect the amount of any fines and
              compensation argued for.
            local community – may be interested in liquidity as the position may affect
              trade and employment possibilities.
            Financial institutions / creditors – the ability of BP to payback their
              liabilities / loans taken.
            Accept any other relevant stakeholder group.

(ii)   Explain how two of the financial consequences of the disaster will
       appear on BP’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2010.                           [4 marks]

       Candidates should consider the impact of two of the following events
       directly on the balance sheet:
        The loss of the oil drilling platform – depreciation of assets/loss of
          assets will increase under fixed assets. Net fixed asset will therefore
          be lower.
        The costs of stopping the leak 250 metres below the sea – increase in
          expenses on the P&L therefore a fall in retained profits for 2010 on
          the P/L and hence a smaller transfer to retain profit on the B/S, also
          possibly an increase in creditors, or any types of short-term debt as
          they have to pay for the extra expenses.
        The cost of the clean-up operations – increase in expenses on the P&L
          therefore a fall in retained profits for 2010, or possibly an increase in
          creditors as they have to pay for the extra expenses. Cash may also
          fall as BP might use cash to start with.
        The fall in share price – this would have no impact on the balance
          sheet. The balance sheet records the share capital raised by selling the
          shares initially. Any future share price movements affect the
          shareholder – not the business.
        The loss of brand image – a fall in intangible fixed assets balanced.
        Compensation to regional businesses – increased current liabilities
          and/or reduction in cash available.
        Compensation to the families of the workers killed – increased current
          liabilities and/or reduction in cash available.

       Accept any other relevant effect and explanation.

       N.B. Do not reward a response that refers to the P/L only without linking
       it to the B/S.

(c)   Explain three possible ways in which BP’s marketing department could
      have better managed the public relations (PR) crisis, to limit the damage
      to BP’s reputation.                                                              [6 marks]

      Public relations (PR) play an important role in communicating messages. The
      perception of BP’s ineffective actions and the subsequent loss of goodwill led
      to the PR crisis.

      Possible ways in which BP’s marketing department could have better managed
      the PR crisis, to limit the damage to BP’s reputation include:
       By having a specialist media centre to communicate with the general public
         through various media. Care should have been taken to choose an
         appropriate channel and media of formal communication. For example, by
         having a specialist media centre to communicate with the general public.
         The enormity of the task been taken on should have been presented to the
         public.
       The CEO should have been briefed so as not to give misleading “quotes” to
         the media.
       The media team could have worked more closely with the politicians and
         media to ensure correct information was given.
       BP should have been seen to respond more quickly, not only to the drilling
         platform explosion, but also to the clean-up.

      Accept any other appropriate PR method / suggestion to manage the crisis.

                 [Source: adapted from finance.yahoo.com, 18 August 2010]


      Using relevant information and the ratios above, analyse the likely impacts
      of the disaster on BP’s future financial performance.                                      [6 marks]

      Liquidity:
      It is clear that given the ratio, BP is having a financial crisis. The acid test ratio
      is very low as it should be around 1. One may argue that liquidity crisis is the
      main cause of financial ruin and the priority of the management should be on
      solving the liquidity crisis. The company is likely to see a further decline,
      especially if the downward trend continues, which could lead to further cash-
      flow problems in the future. Overall the business is in danger if a further
      untoward event happens.

      However, one may argue that given the nature of the organization, the current
      ratio is perhaps more significant as oil is stocked and is likely to be sold even if
      demand falls. Moreover, the low acid test ratio may force the management to
      take more immediate action to solve the problem now. Given the low gearing
      ratio and the fact that it is still profitable, BP is likely to be able to secure a
      loan from the bank.

      Gearing:
      Gearing indicates that whilst the amount of borrowing compared to issuing
      shares is almost double that of 2008 some banks may be reluctant to lend funds
      to BP given the pressures from the media and pressure groups. However, BP is
      still a low geared organization. The management will need to monitor this
      ratio carefully.
                                      – 16 –            N12/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Shareholder:
The fall in dividends can be attributed to the loss of assets and would worry
future investors as well as existing shareholders. BP may lose out especially in
the long term as the loss of potential in particular US investors may harm the
growth of the business. Also it may encourage institutional investors to sell BP
shares, pushing BP’s share price downwards and would also make a possible
“rights issue” less attractive.

However, with the appropriate PR and possibly through holding a
shareholders’ meeting, the CEO and other top management could explain the
reasons for the zero dividend and reassure investors of the future direction of
the organization.

Profitability:
There appears to be a major decline in profitability as BP is likely to see a
sharp fall in custom – particularly from US customers. Also the writing off of
assets will have a major impact on expenses and therefore net profit, thus
leaving less funds for reinvestment. Whilst this sharp rise in expenses is likely
to be short term, the fall in sales may reflect a significant change in consumer
buying patterns and so should worry BP.

Nevertheless, BP is still profitable and with the right financial and marketing
strategy to pacify investors, pressure groups and the media, the fall in demand
for such a price elastic good might not be as large as expected. Still, one may
argue that the dangerously low acid test ratio is much more significant for BP
and highly likely to negatively affect their financial performance.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

To reach the top markband all four ratios (liquidity, gearing, shareholder and
profitability) should be analysed.

           Some of the practices of a Kaizen (continuous improvement) approach to
           manufacturing may include:
            just-in-time (JIT) production and stock management, whereby the stock is
             ordered and production begins when an order has been made
            shorter development time
            zero defect policy that aims to prevent defect rather than correct defects
            the use of quality circles where employees are encouraged to suggest
             practices to improve quality
            group/team work with flexible specialization.

           Accept any other relevant practice.


           N.B. It is expected that the candidate describes, rather than just lists, the nature
           of each of the chosen practices.

(b)   Explain two methods of research that Toyota’s marketing department
      could use to improve its relationship with customers.                               [6 marks]

      The answer is largely about market research in order to become a more
      customer-focused organization and the development of relationship marketing.

      Some of the methods may include the following:
      Toyota’s marketing department can make use of primary research to build
      relationship marketing.

      Modern technology could be used to build a constant relationship with
      customers and create a database of information of the customers purchasing
      habits, with constant communications about their experiences from using their
      car. Customers could be sent a post-purchase online questionnaire to ask for
      feedback on the quality of their current car purchased. Suggestions could be
      collected regarding improvement, needs, taste and preference. Through
      listening, models can be adapted accordingly and information can be used to
      change future models.

      Other primary research methods to achieve the above:
       use focus groups and/or consumer panels
       test marketing to monitor reaction before a full launch of a new model
       postal survey of customers needs, feedback, reaction, etc.

      Secondary research can also be used by Toyota:
       the use of internal and external data like: past customer complaints, existing
        reports on past defects
       industry reports on taste/preference/safety issues/advanced technology.

      Accept any other relevant suggestion/method and explanation.

      It is expected the candidate fully explains the nature of each of the chosen
      method of research and how each method actually enables Toyota to improve
      the relationship with its customers.

      It is not expected the response will cover both primary and secondary research.

      [3 marks].

(c)   Examine Toyota’s decision to outsource “production activities of some car
      parts to overseas manufacturers”.                                                     [6 marks]

      Possible arguments in favour of Toyota “outsourcing production activities of
      some car parts to overseas manufacturers”:

      Toyota is a multinational company operating in many countries around
      the world. One can assume that Toyota’s managers wanted to take advantage
      of the outsourcing practice to local businesses with expertise/know-how in
      order to:
       use the “know how” of a specialist subcontractor
       reduce production costs due to specialist producers gaining economies of
         scale, using cheap labour, or using any relevant local advantages
       increase the speed of global expansion and entry into different countries
       get some government approval and develop a better relationship with the
         host government and the customers given the employment / revenue
         opportunities created
       reduce the lead time for the arrival of the components/parts given the close
         proximity
       avoid different methods of protectionism especially import tax
       allow Toyota to concentrate on its core competencies like design,
         technology, marketing etc.

      Accept any other relevant point.


      However, as stated in the stimulus material, the quality of some of the car
      components was compromised. Toyota was not able to control the quality of
      the outsourced parts. The outsourcing of production activities resulted in
      inconsistent quality, defects and damage to its reputation / market share / profit.
      On top of reputation and branding costs, the recall actually cost Toyota
      $2 billion. This is probably as significant if not more significant than the
      saving made by outsourcing.

      Once an activity is outsourced; it is often difficult to start reproducing a
      particular part if Toyota scaled down production facilities.

      Accept any other relevant applicable issue and any relevant examination.

      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced examination of
      two possible arguments for and two possible arguments against outsourcing
      production activities.

      For one relevant argument for and one relevant argument against award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no balanced examination,
      award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   To what extent will Toyota be able to recover its reputation, core values
      and brand image?                                                                     [9 marks]

      As stated in the stimulus material, Toyota’s ignored its core values of “safety
      first, quality second and volume third”. On the one hand one can argue that
      Toyota suffered irreversible damage to its brand image and customers’ trust in
      its core values. Toyota is perceived as a profit seeker that was willing to
      compromise on safety and quality.

      The staff morale is low – their concerns were ignored. It might take years of
      investment in order to regain the trust of its customers. Such investment may
      result in short-term further loss or a fall in profit, market share and a possible
      further fall in share price. However, as presented in the stimulus, one can
      argue that the negative effects are largely short term.

      Analysts believe that the president is the right person to deal with the problem.
      He has personal stake in the business. The crisis made Toyota realize how its
      strategic objectives changed for the worse. In crisis, it is often easier to
      implement changes without resistance. Toyota is likely to succeed in
      implementing some urgent and possibly imposed changes – as mentioned in
      the stimulus material.

      Toyota already responded by pledging to implement new quality control
      standards, and set up a response team to investigate within 24 hours every
      defect reported. Toyota is going to pay close attention to customers’ feedback
      with its new procedures. Moreover, Toyota has some reserve of US$23 billion
      to deal with the problem and to implement the required procedures. Toyota can
      probably withstand the current expenses / loss of revenue / fall in profit in the
      short term. Moreover, other car manufacturers have also experienced some
      defects which resulted in product recall. Such occurrences may enable Toyota
      to somewhat restore its brand image.

      One may judge that Toyota’s new practices to restore its reputation and core
      values are quite tangible and are truly genuine. These practices should enable
      the organization to improve the currently deflated brand image. Sales have
      already started to recover in America – they went up by 6 %, which is a
      relatively significant figure and demonstrates the fact that perhaps customers
      believe in Toyota’s attempt to refocus and recreate the core values.

      Despite some short-term difficulties, the actions taken increase the likelihood
      of recovering. Toyota is to a large extent likely to recover in the medium to
      long term. The newly established core values are highly likely to restore and
      improve its reputation and brand image. Toyota is likely to resume its leading
      position in the car industry.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated judgment and discussion.

4.   (a)   Describe two possible factors that have contributed to the growth of
           globalization.                                                                      [4 marks]

           Some of the factors that have contributed to the growth of globalization are:
            rapid technological changes
            lower transportation costs
            lower cost and higher efficiency of communication
            deregulation of the financial markets
            the liberalization of trade
            the growth of emerging markets
            the convergence of consumers’ tastes
            accept any other relevant factor.

           The above is a list. It is expected that candidates describe the two factors that
           they identify.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct factor identified and [1 mark] for each
           relevant and correct description, up to a maximum of [2 marks].

        [Source: http://tutor2u.net/business/strategy/ansoff_matrix.htm, accessed 20 July 2012]


      McDonald’s® strategic growth can be classified as:

      Product development:
       different products with different ingredients / different size for the same /
         current / existing national/international markets.

      Market development:
       targeting new segments like young mothers who did not eat at McDonald’s®
        before due to the large portions of its meals
       attracting health-conscious customers with more chicken-based products (an
        assumption is made that very few chicken products were offered before).

      Market penetration:
       the upgrade of facilities for the existing and any new customers that
        previously have not used McDonald’s® in the current / existing markets
       offering good value items to recession-prone existing and new customers.

      Award candidates who see targeting new segments like young mothers with the
      “Little Tasters®” menu and possibly attracting health-conscious customers with
      chicken-based products as related diversification.

      [1 to 2 marks]
      A list is provided. The answer lacks considerable depth and application.
      No reference is made to the information in the stimulus material.

      If the Ansoff matrix is accurately drawn but the growth strategies are just
      placed on it, award a maximum of [2 marks].

      [3 to 4 marks]
      One relevant growth strategy is fully explained and applied. The Ansoff
      matrix is accurately drawn and labelled. Reference is made to the information
      in the stimulus material.
      Or:
      Two relevant growth strategies are identified or described, but the response
      lacks explanation and/or lacks constant reference to the information in the
      stimulus material.

      If the Ansoff matrix is not drawn, award a maximum of [4 marks] even if an
      appropriate explanation is given for the two growth strategies.

      [5 to 6 marks]
      Two relevant growth strategies are fully explained and applied. The Ansoff
      matrix is accurately drawn and labelled. Reference is made to the information
      in the stimulus material.

(c)   Analyse the possible impacts of multinational companies like McDonald’s®
      on the host countries.                                                            [6 marks]

      Although the question may seem rather theoretical, nevertheless, it is expected
      that candidates make some reference to McDonald’s® as a multinational
      company (MNC) and use information from the stimulus material.

      Some of the positive impacts may include the following:
       McDonald’s® provides employment and training to its employees in its
        restaurants. The quality of the labour force can increase.
       McDonald’s® improved the menu choice: healthier food, local food so
        customers do not have to rely only on local food providers. Hence more
        choice is provided for the citizens.
       Global competition clearly exists in this market. Competition between
        McDonald’s® and other food and drink suppliers like KFC® and Starbucks®
        can lead to reduced prices, an improvement in choice as well as
        improvements to the service to customers. Transfer of knowledge/
        know-how (is done through franchising).
       It is mentioned in the stimulus material that McDonald’s® (and other
        MNCs) source local construction material and local labour – more revenue
        in terms of expenditure and wages is injected into the economy. Wider
        economic benefits can be gained (the multiplier effect).
       McDonald’s® tends to be profitable and is taxed by the host governments.
        Revenue is hence generated for host governments providing further positive
        consequences for the host economies.

      Accept any other relevant positive impact.

      However, being a dominating global company, one may argue that companies
      like McDonald’s® encourage Western consumption of fast food around the
      world.       Local competitors cannot compete with its resources/
      expertise and have to close down especially now when these MNCs actually
      adapt to local taste – Maharaja Mac™, McLobster® etc. There is a danger that
      companies like McDonald’s® actually monopolize a market rather than
      encourage healthy competition and choice. One may also argue that they
      destroy local ways of life. Local unemployment may increase if local
      businesses cannot compete. Due to some practices of transfer pricing and/or
      local government support, not much taxes on profit are paid to the host
      government.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced analysis of two
      positives and two negatives of the impacts of MNCs like McDonald’s® on the
      host countries.

      For one relevant positive impact and one relevant negative impact award up to
      a maximum of [3 marks].

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no balanced analysis,
      award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss the effectiveness of the “think locally, grow globally” strategy used
      by McDonald’s®.                                                                    [9 marks]

      Based on the information in the stimulus material, it appears that the
      McDonald’s® strategy of “think locally, grow globally” can be seen as
      successful. The evidence:
       Business has been booming in the UK – 13 million more customers visited
         McDonald’s® in the UK in 2010 despite an economic recession.
       It achieved other local commercial success in Canada, India and Japan with
         its adaptation to local needs/taste/eating habits. It successfully launched
         products made from local produce and suited to local tastes such as the
         Maharaja Mac™ in India, the McLobster™ in Canada and the Ebi Filet-O™
         (a shrimp burger) in Japan. It is said in the stimulus “proved successful in
         the UK and beyond”. The above arguments can be judged as very
         significant ones.

      However, McDonald’s® has launched a global uniform initiative to redecorate
      its restaurant with uniform appearance. McDonald’s® still tries to maintain the
      global recognition and the quality of its global brand. Perhaps McDonald’s®
      will revert to more global unified strategies.

      No information is provided in the stimulus material on costs and profit of such
      local initiatives. Only the number of consumers is given. McDonald’s® might
      not have increased profit, only its market share. Perhaps the product adaptation
                                       – 25 –            N12/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


strategy, which is generally expensive, will not be sustainable in the long run if
profit does not increase. Still, the increase in market share of McDonald’s® is a
commendable achievement during an economic recession in the UK.

More worrying for McDonald’s® is the fact that other MNC companies
that serve/sell similar products/services are now using the same idea of
localization in their expansion. McDonald’s® success may only be short term.
McDonald’s® will have to become even more innovative in its approach and
that might create significant extra costs. Unless the overall market is growing
(no information in the stimulus material) the success of McDonald’s® may be
short lived. Perhaps the arguments against can be judged as less significant
ones as they are more on the speculative side, albeit important.

Accept any other substantiated discussion with a conclusion.


A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments in favour and at
least two arguments against.

If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no discussion, award a
maximum of [4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows
balanced analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to
the stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5 to 7] markband if they give judgment/
conclusions that are not based on analysis already given in their answer.

5.   (a)   Define the term corporate social responsibility.                                   [2 marks]

           Corporate social responsibility is when a business recognizes that it has an
           obligation and continuing commitment to behave ethically and responsibly
           towards various stakeholders like improving the quality of life of the workforce
           and their families as well as the local community at large.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].


     (b)   Identify two possible causes of a liquidity problem.                               [2 marks]

           Possible causes of a liquidity problem include:
            poor collection of cash from debtors
            overstocking of items which are not selling
            debtor day and creditor day cycles may be inappropriate for a particular
             business
            accept any other possible cause of a liquidity problem.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct possible cause of a liquidity problem, up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

           Award [1 mark] for a list of 2 relevant possible causes of liquidity. Some
           description is expected.

(c)   Explain how the following may have contributed to IM’s financial
      problems:

      (i)    its mission statement.                                                         [3 marks]

              The mission statement “Action not words” is too vague to be useful to
               the business and its stakeholders. Without a stronger statement
               stakeholders are left without a sense of direction or purpose. The
               mission is actually just a vision and as such may lead to an inability to
               secure funding.
              Using the title of the CD as the mission may seem a good link, but it
               also may lead to confusion about whether Rox, or IM, are the focus of
               the business and could lead to a lack of support for the business
               financially.

             Accept any other relevant consequence of the vague mission statement.


             Award [1 mark] for an issue with the mission statement identified and
             [1 mark] for an explanation of the impact of that issue. Award an
             additional [1 mark] for a full explanation of the impact that is directly
             applied to the financial problems of IM, up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (ii)   its limited marketing budget.                                                 [3 marks]

              The limited marketing budget means that promotion will be
               constrained and there would be little chance of above the line
               promotion, which would naturally limit its effect on financial support.
              The limited marketing budget resulted in a lack of market research
               which is a key factor here in showing whether the market is actually
               sustainable. Is it possible to run a non-profit business in this market?
              IM might not have sufficient funds to run a PR department to counter
               negative publicity as a result of Louis’ dismissal and Michel’s
               autocratic leadership.

             Accept any other relevant consequence of the limited marketing budget.


             Award [1 mark] for an issue with the limited marketing budget identified
             and [1 mark] for an explanation of the impact of that issue. Award an
             additional [1 mark] for a full explanation of the impact that is directly
             applied to the financial problems of IM, up to a maximum of [3 marks].
                                            – 28 –           N12/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Analyse the appropriateness of Michel’s autocratic leadership style, for
      the running of an organization such as IM.                                        [6 marks]

      Arguments for an autocratic leadership style include:
       the laissez-faire leadership style is clearly not appropriate for IM as
        evidence of students attendance, stolen instruments demonstrate. There
        needs to be some form of control
       autocratic leaders can make quick decisions – this is necessary for IM if the
        business is to be rescued
       should IM need to change direction then this is a lot easier if one person
        makes the decisions
       accept any other relevant argument for.

      Arguments against an autocratic leadership style include:
       too much control can be counterproductive in the long term especially for
        businesses relying on goodwill as well as creativity for support
       businesses that seek to nurture artistic talent may not work well with
        autocratic leaders
       this type of leadership style does not nurture future leaders and initiative
        among employees
       accept any other relevant argument against.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      It is not expected that candidates will include all of the above points in
      their answer.

      A balanced response is one that covers at least two issues for and at least two
      issues against.

      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced analysis.

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no balanced analysis,
      award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                           – 29 –            N12/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Discuss two possible medium- to long-term external sources of finance that
      IM could use to help solve its financial problems.                                [9 marks]

      Possible medium- to long-term external sources of finance include:
       Seek new funding/finance from philanthropic investors/business angels.
        However, new business angels may demand greater scrutiny, or ask for
        control in the organization. This could have an impact on IM’s
        mission statement.
       Bank loan secured against future royalties from Rox. However, a bank may
        impose a high interest rate if it thinks that the risk is high.
       Rox to invest further in IM to demonstrate their commitment to CSR.
        However, will Rox be willing to bail out IM? It is already invested in the
        organization and is holding a concert. There is an indication in the stimulus
        material that the group has insufficient funds.
       Share capital (probably private and restricted to businesses/musicians in the
        music industry) sufficient funds could be raised. However, financial
        controls demanded by the new investors may inhibit some forms of
        creativity. Michel will have to justify this strategy to the shareholders and
        seek approval; moreover, issuing shares may be expensive. New investors
        may demand a quick return for their involvement and this adds additional
        pressure on IM at a time of falling revenue.
       Government grants/subsidies. On the positive side, this money does not
        have to be paid back. However, is the government likely to offer a subsidy
        for such a luxurious product?

      However, as the business is quite a new venture it may be difficult to source
      external finance. Michel will have to present IM as a viable business venture
      which may be difficult given its questionable success (“low attendance”,
      “student missing lessons”). It already says in the stimulus that he has been
      unable to attract external sources of finance. This is a difficult decision for
      Michel given his leadership style. He would have to give up some form of
      control of the organization.

      It is expected that the candidates provide substantiated conclusions which
      incorporate the significance of the arguments presented which are prioritized.

      Accept any judgment, provided it is well substantiated/supported and relevant
      to IM.

      Accept any other substantiated discussion with a conclusion.


      If the candidate does not discuss two possible sources of external finance then
      they can only achieve up to a maximum of [3 to 4 marks].

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no discussion, award a
      maximum of [4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows
balanced analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to
the stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5 to 7] markband if they give judgment/
conclusions that are not based on analysis already given in their answer.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
