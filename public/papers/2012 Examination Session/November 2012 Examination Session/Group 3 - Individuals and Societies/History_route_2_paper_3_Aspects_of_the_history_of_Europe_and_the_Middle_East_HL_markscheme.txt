 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
         insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
         than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability.                Evaluation of different approaches may
        be present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison
        and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-
        structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

The French Revolution and Napoleon — mid eighteenth century to 1815

1.   Assess the contribution made by the ideas of the Enlightenment to the outbreak of the
     French Revolution.

     In order to assess this, candidates will have to consider the main causes of the French revolution:
     such as the economic crisis, the nature of the ancien régime, social divisions, the rule of
     Louis XVI, disaffection in the army as well as the ideas of the Enlightenment. These were to be
     found in L’Encylopédie which was critical of absolutism and Catholicism although only Rousseau
     advocated “sovereignty of the people”. Others were hostile to the notion of “divine right”,
     despotism, censorship, etc. Many readers of the L’Encylcopédie were members of the nobility yet
     still advocated more recognition of ability in all areas of public life. These ideas were adopted and
     expanded on in various radical pamphlets and newspapers and no doubt contributed to a more
     radical revolution. All key factors should be addressed and linked where appropriate to the ideas of
     the Enlightenment.


2.   Analyse the factors which allowed Napoleon Bonaparte to gain and retain power in France in
     the years 1795–1804.

     Gaining power could include: his military career from the siege of Toulon, command of the army
     of Italy and his successful campaign there which culminated in the Treaty of Campo Formio,
     his activities within France such as his suppression of the Vendémiaire Revolt, his links with the
     Directors such as Barras which made him an ideal “sword” when they needed help to deal with an
     increasingly unstable situation (e.g. Coup de Fructidor, and increasing support for the Jacobins).

     Retaining power could include: after the 1789 Coup de Brumaire he became Consul – he used this
     position to extend his control over the legal and local government system, while at the same time
     continuing his military successes in the war of the Second Coalition. In May 1802 he was offered
     Consulship for Life and in 1804 was “offered” the role of hereditary emperor by the Senate.
     Clearly military success was a key factor but fully balanced answers should consider internal
     instability in France which gave him the opportunity to capitalize on his reputation.

     If only “gain” or “retain” is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].
                                                  –5–               N12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M

Unification and consolidation of Germany and Italy 1815–1890

3.   Explain the reasons for the decline of Austria in European affairs by 1870.

     Austria was a major power until 1848 but began to decline in terms of influence in the 1850s.

     Reasons could include:
      the Crimean War – she remained neutral which left her isolated and Russia hostile;
      defeat by France and Piedmont in 1859 reduced her credibility as major military power;
      in the 1860s the rise of Prussia and Austria’s exclusion from the Zollverein reduced her influence
       in the German Confederation;
      defeat in 1866 in the Austro–Prussian War and the unification of Germany by 1870 underlined
       the decline of Austria as the pre-eminent Germanic state;
      it was not until the establishment of the Dreikaiserbund in 1872 that Austria appeared to be
       regaining some of her importance. Though this is past the date set in the question candidates
       mentioning it should be credited.

     Chronological narrative should not score more than [8 marks] – factual evidence should be
     accompanied by analysis showing how each event contributed to decline.


4.   Assess the successes and failures of Bismarck’s foreign policy in the years 1871–1890.

     To evaluate success candidates should be able to clearly state Bismarck’s aims: the isolation of
     France to avoid a war of revenge, the extension of German influence and the maintenance of peace
     in Europe.

     France was kept isolated until 1892 by his complex system of alliances (Dreikaiserbund,
     Dual Alliance, Reinsurance treaty etc.). He was able to help maintain peace by acting as an
     “honest broker” in 1878 at the Congress of Berlin and use the Mediterranean Agreements as means
     of preventing tensions between Austria and Russia leading to conflict.

     However Russia’s firm line (supported by Britain) over the “war in sight crisis” in 1875 indicated
     that France was not completely isolated and that his alliances were not as firm as he hoped. A
     major weakness of his foreign policy was its complexity and the fact that it relied on him personally
     for success. Once he was removed from office in 1890 the system he created began
     to unravel.

     This is NOT a unification question. Discussion of events leading up to unification should not
     receive credit. However, candidates may make reference to the impact of unification on
     international affairs after 1871.

     If only successes or failures are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].
                                                 –6–               N12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M

Ottoman Empire from the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century

5.   Assess the effectiveness of the settlement of 1861 in reducing the tensions which had led to
     civil war in Lebanon.

     Answers will need to clearly identify the tensions and then consider how effectively these tensions
     were dealt with in the 1861 settlement.

     Causes of tension were: communal tensions (between Christians and Muslims) as well as tensions
     within individual religious groups. Economic tensions between peasants and landlords were also a
     factor. The weakness of Ottoman rule meant these tensions led to conflict, thus weak government
     was a factor. British and French influence in the area also contributed to tensions.

     The Montassarifiah Settlement needs to be analysed closely.

     The settlement was guaranteed internationally (Britain and France continued to protect Druze
     and Maronites) and established an elected council where all communities had representation.
     The settlement gave some autonomy and a limited role for government. Taxes were lower which
     reduced economic difficulties.

     However there were difficulties – the council had to rely on Ottoman funds (in order to avoid
     high taxation) and Ottoman military forces to suppress disorder and full autonomy was difficult
     without access to the sea.

     If only the tensions or the settlement is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].


6.   ―Abdul Hamid II is best described as an enlightened despot.‖ To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     Both “enlightened” and “despot” need to be considered for fully balanced answers. Enlightened
     could be considered to be a desire to modernize the state and Abdul Hamid certainly attempted to
     do this. He introduced educational reforms leading to a new educated elite in Turkey as well as
     introducing military reforms – improving training etc. Communications were extended in Turkey.
     However much of this was aimed at improving military capability rather than economic
     infrastructure so it did not modernize the economy.

     Politically he rapidly suspended the constitution, which he had granted in 1876, censorship was
     extensive, and the regime was repressive. He was unwilling to allow western ideas to spread and in
     foreign affairs he was seen as weak and damaging the empire. The promised political reform after
     the Young Turk movement emerged was short-lived and he was deposed in 1909.
                                                  –7–                N12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M

Western and Northern Europe 1848–1914

7.   ―The 1848 revolution in France established the Second Republic almost by accident.‖
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The reasons why the monarchy was so unpopular by 1848 should be referred to. They include:
     weak foreign policy, economic stagnation, corruption in government and refusal to enact political
     reform but the focus should be mainly on the events of 1848.

     Poor government decision making in banning the political banquets led to public demonstrations
     which increased with the use of force. The defection of the National Guard contributed to Louis
     Philippe’s decision to abdicate and flee to England. This left a vacuum, which was filled by the
     provisional government. Analysis should focus on the results of the April 1848 elections after
     which moderates dominated the Constituent Assembly – indicating that most French people were
     seeking a conservative solution. Radical elements in Paris were important in causing Louis
     Philippe’s abdication, and there was no obvious successor to Louis Philippe. However, the election
     of Louis Napoleon as president in November 1848 with a huge majority (and the relative ease with
     which he had established the Second Empire by 1851) indicated the lack of enthusiasm for radical
     republicanism in France as a whole.

     Therefore the issue of “by accident” could be related to the speed of events in Paris and the fact that
     the population of Paris was much more radical than the population of rural France.


8.   Examine the domestic policies of Napoleon III.

     A good starting point would be to define Napoleon III’s goals: order, stability and economic
     prosperity and examine his policies with reference to these goals.

     Areas to consider could include:
      political repression in the 1850s to deal with radical elements. Some relaxation in the 1860s;
      educational improvements to promote economic growth whilst Falloux’s law maintained the
       support of the clergy;
      improvements in the banking system contributed to prosperity and free trade treaties such as
       Cobden–Chevalier were also beneficial to the economy. Improvements in the railways helped
       internal trade;
      political reforms of the 1860s prevented the growth of opposition;
      the Liberal empire with the reduction of censorship, the emergence of the Third Party all led to
       support for the empire as was shown by the plebiscite of May 1870.

     Modernization of Paris by Hausmann could arguably be seen as a success in raising French prestige
     but it also contributed to working class hostility towards the empire which was significant in 1870.

Imperial Russia, revolutions, emergence of Soviet State 1853–1924

9.    Analyse the causes and consequences of the 1905 revolution in Russia.

      Causes
      Industrialization and the growth of an urban working class living and working in poor conditions
      in the cities. The continuing problem of land hunger and stagnation in the countryside. A
      discontented moderate middle class element frustrated at the lack of political change. The disaster
      of the Russo–Japanese war and Bloody Sunday all contributed to anger at the regime and the
      widespread strikes and disturbances of 1905.

      Consequences
      Limited political reform – the October Manifesto and the establishment of the State Duma which
      was accompanied by repression; “Stolypin’s Necktie”.

      Stolypin’s reforms, especially in the countryside, were intended to create a prosperous loyal peasant
      class, “the gamble on the strong”. These were very slow in taking effect – Stolypin felt he needed
      twenty years. Politically the limited power of the Duma was eroded by 1908 and the electorate
      reduced in number. The Tsar’s reputation as the “Little Father” was damaged as a result of the
      repression.

      Politically there was little real change and reforms were slow to make an impact. The events of
      1905 could be seen as a long term cause of the February 1917 revolution.

      If only causes or consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].


10.   Compare and contrast the roles of Lenin and Trotsky in the Bolshevik seizure of power in
      October 1917.

      For ―compare‖
       both were intellectuals and important in generating support for the Bolsheviks: Lenin through his
        policy ideas such as “Peace, Land and Bread” and “All power to the Soviets”; Trotsky as
        Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet;
       both were aware of the increasing desire to get out of the war and used this popular demand to
        attract support for the Bolsheviks;
       both were willing to take the risk of a coup despite the fact that Russian conditions did not fit the
        Marxist model of revolution.

      For ―contrast‖
       Lenin was much more of a politician and used his skills to persuade the Central Committee to
        attempt the coup in October to coincide with the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets;
       Trotsky was the detailed planner of the coup in his position as chair of the MRC (Military
        Revolutionary Committee). He organized the Red Guard and decided which key points to seize
        in Petrograd in order to carry out the coup.

      Although contrasts are less obvious, expect reference to the different roles they played.

      If only compare or contrast or if only Lenin or Trotsky is addressed, mark out of a maximum of
      [11 marks].

European diplomacy and the First World War 1870–1923

11.   Assess the impact of the First World War on the civilian population of any one country you
      have studied.

      Britain, Germany, France and Russia are likely to be popular choices, however credit any other
      country from the region.

      Areas to be explored could include: the impact of conscription, the movement of women into the
      workforce in new areas of employment, economic disruption, rationing and the impact on the health
      of the population, civilian casualties where appropriate. The growth of labour unrest because of
      harsh wartime working conditions. The growth of political radicalism.

      Specific detailed evidence should be presented to support analysis of impact.             Generalized
      unsupported answers should not score well.


12.   ―The Paris Peace Treaties caused political problems for both the victorious and defeated
      nations in the early 1920s.‖ To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Victorious nations could include Britain, France and Italy, although Italy is the most likely choice
      because of the dissatisfaction with the “mutilated victory”. Political problems could also include
      criticism of the negotiations and of the final outcome which left many in France dissatisfied. There
      was also political debate in Britain over the Treaties’ provisions. Answers may refer to Keynes’
      criticism of the economic aspects of the Treaty of Versailles.

      Defeated nations could include Germany, Turkey or any of the Central Powers. Germany will be
      popular but the date should indicate to candidates that this is not a rise of Hitler question.

      For Germany political problems could include the impact on the new Weimar Republic, the rise of
      extremist groups such as the Freikorps, the Nationalist Party’s dislike of the Treaty of Versailles led
      to constant criticism of Weimar governments. There were high levels of political violence
      undermining the new republic. Right wing attempts to overthrow the republic (Kapp Putsch,
      Munich Putsch). More able candidates might argue that the dislike of the Treaty of Versailles made
      cooperation between parties difficult. Where reparations are considered they should be linked to
      the political consequences of economic problems.

      If Turkey is chosen, the following could be discussed: anger over the Treaty of Sèvres and loss of
      territory etc. and how this led to the increase in support for Turkish nationalist groups, the
      overthrow of the Sultan and the establishment of the Turkish republic.

      Both victorious and defeated powers should be considered although there may be some imbalance.

      If only either victorious or defeated powers are considered, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].

War and change in the Middle East 1914–1949

13.   Why, and with what consequences, did the Arab Revolt of 1916 take place?

      The revolt occurred with the encouragement of the British, because they wanted to protect Suez and
      to try and weaken the Turkish war effort by overstretching their forces. The Arabs were willing to
      revolt against the Turks as a means of gaining independence post-war as promised in the
      MacMahon–Hussein Correspondence.

      Consequences of the revolt: the Hejaz rail link was broken and Turkish forces were split as well as
      having their supplies disrupted. This allowed Allenby to make progress in Palestine capturing
      Jerusalem and moving on to Damascus which marked the beginning of the defeat of Turkey.

      Longer term consequences could be the eventual independence of Saudi Arabia but also the
      frustration of Arabs in other areas of former Ottoman territories who felt their wartime efforts had
      not been rewarded leading to instability in the mandates.

      If only “why” or “consequences” is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].


14.   Assess the reasons for the British decision to hand over the Palestine Mandate to the United
      Nations by 1948.

      Problems in the 1920s and 1930s could be discussed here to illustrate the difficulties Britain faced
      as the mandatory power. However the main focus should be on the last few years of British rule.

      Reasons
      Active Jewish opposition to British rule as the Second World War drew to a close – Irgun and Stern
      Gang increased their attacks as Britain continued to limit Jewish immigration – for example the
      blowing up the King David Hotel, hanging British soldiers. All contributed to a decline in British
      morale as well as increasing the cost of governing.

      Internationally, Britain faced criticism for her policies: Truman accepted the Biltmore Declaration,
      there was massive sympathy for Jewish refugees from Europe and incidents such as the Exodus
      increased criticism of Britain.

      Britain also had serious economic problems at home and Palestine was a drain on scarce resources.
      Britain also had problems elsewhere (e.g. India). There was also the realization that the British
      could not satisfy the Zionists without alienating Arab states.

      All of these factors contributed to Britain’s decision to hand an increasingly intractable problem
      over to the United Nations.

Interwar years: conflict and cooperation 1919–1939

15.   ―Mussolini’s foreign policy between 1922 and 1941 was inconsistent and unsuccessful.‖
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Success
      Mussolini’s foreign policy was largely effective until the mid 1930s. It was largely based on
      diplomatic activity designed to maintain Italy’s status as a major power. Relations were good with
      Britain and France. Evidence could include the various treaties he made in the early twenties,
      settling the issue of Fiume, his involvement with the Locarno Accords but there was also the
      Corfu Incident.

      The early 1930s were also mainly concerned with diplomatic activity e.g. Treaty of Friendship with
      Austria cooperating with Britain and France in the Stresa Front. From 1935 onwards it was much
      more aggressive – Abyssinia, Spanish Civil War, Axis agreement, Pact of Steel etc. However he
      was also keen to avoid war at the Munich Conference and was still attempting to get some sort of
      treaty with Britain as late as 1939.

      There is ample material to illustrate “inconsistent”. The issue of “unsuccessful” could include the
      cost and failure of his military actions, his closer ties with Hitler which drew Italy into war in 1940
      with disastrous consequences.


16.   Analyse the political impact of the Great Depression on either Britain or Germany.

      Germany will probably be the most popular choice. The focus is political and therefore social and
      economic issues should be linked to the consequences for politics. The economic crisis led to the
      polarization of politics with the rise of right- and left- wing political parties.

      In the case of Germany the problems caused by the depression can be directly linked to the decline
      of parliamentary government in the years 1929–1933. They also contributed to the rise of the Nazis
      on a national level from a position of weakness pre-1929.

      In Britain politics also drifted to the right with the collapse of Macdonald’s government in 1931 and
      the establishment of the National government. The impact of the depression also contributed to
      support for Mosley and the BUF (British Union of Fascists), but the parliamentary system remained
      in place.

The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 1924–2000

17.   Compare and contrast the aims and methods of Stalin’s foreign policy in the 1930s and the
      post-war years.

      For ―compare‖
       in both periods he sought security for the Soviet Union;
       in both periods he used other nations as a means of providing a buffer for the Soviet Union from
        potential threats.

      For ―contrast‖
       these are mainly concerned with methods used at different times.

      In the 1930s, he tried to cooperate with other powers – joining the League of Nations in 1934,
      signing pacts with both France and Czechoslovakia – essentially seeking Collective Security. When
      that failed he also resorted to appeasement of aggressive nations – Japan in the Far East and
      Germany with the Nazi–Soviet Pact.

      In the post-war period his aims could be considered as spreading communism in the Eastern
      European states. This is an area for debate. Candidates could argue that his lack of involvement in
      the Greek Civil War could provide evidence that security was his main goal. In the post-war period
      Stalin’s methods appeared to be much more aggressive particularly in Germany with tactics which
      included the Berlin blockade and, ultimately, the establishment of the Warsaw Pact.

      What is very clear is that Stalin sought security by establishing a buffer zone of states where the
      governments were “friendly” to the Soviet Union. This was achieved either by force or the threat of
      force.

      If only compare or contrast or if only aims or methods are addressed, mark out of a maximum of
      [11 marks].

18.   Analyse the successes and failures of Khrushchev’s domestic policies in the years 1955–1964.

      The focus should be on the Khrushchev years although candidates may make a link between some
      of Khrushchev’s policies and those of Malenkov.

      Policies
      Destalinization – he was anxious to maintain the power of the party and the destalinization process
      was designed to blame Stalin personally for the problems of the Soviet Union and not the party.
      This was successful in two ways – no blame was attached to the party and its dominance was
      continued, and because of this Khrushchev had the party as a power base and its support when he
      launched policy changes.

      Agriculture
      There was less centralised control of agriculture, lower taxes and higher grain prices to encourage
      production. MTSs (Motor Tractor Stations) were closed and in the years 1952–1958 farm workers’
      income doubled. He introduced the “Virgin Lands” policy with huge investment (120 000 tractors)
      and 6 million acres were ploughed in the first year. Poor planning meant that local conditions were
      ignored – unsuitable crops were planted. There was also shortage of fertilisers. Success: in the
      1950s there was an overall increase of grain production in traditional areas, but limited success was
      achieved in the Virgin Lands.

      Industry
      There was a move away from heavy industry, the focus was on light engineering and chemicals plus
      improving the standard of living. Khrushchev scrapped the Sixth Five Year Plan – introduced
      incentives and when the Seventh was introduced it had met many of its targets by 1965. Although
      there were still problems of underproduction in food and serious accommodation problems.

      In political terms the reduction of bureaucracy was resented by the party members and contributed
      to the growth of opposition to him at home.

      If only successes or failures are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].

The Second World War and post-war Western Europe 1939–2000

19.   Assess the changing nature of the Franco regime in Spain in the years 1939–1975.

      In the immediate post-civil war period the focus was on consolidating power and the regime was
      extremely authoritarian, conservative and repressive. There was limited political activity as
      Nationalist parties were merged into FET (Spanish Traditionalist Falange) and opposition parties
      were illegal. There were many arrests and executions of political opponents. The Church was
      restored to its eminent position in society. Franco gained the support of monarchists by the 1947
      Law of Succession whereby he would remain head of state until his death and he would then be
      succeeded by a Bourbon monarch. Standards of living remained very low as Franco tried to make
      Spain economically self-contained.

      From 1957 Franco was less involved in government. Therefore the government was more
      influenced by technocrats and modernizers. As a consequence the economy began to grow. New
      industries were introduced, particularly tourism, and Spain became less isolated in Europe.
      Politically the regime remained authoritarian and conservative although there was some limited
      press freedom.


20.   ―Governments in post-war Europe were committed to full social welfare provision.‖ With
      reference to one country you have studied, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Social welfare can be defined as healthcare, benefits such as unemployment benefit, pensions, sick
      pay etc., as well as social housing and state-funded education from primary to tertiary level.

      Details of the provision in the chosen country is necessary for well-evidenced answers. Higher
      level answers may focus on the issue of what is meant by “full” provision.

      Descriptive, generalized answers should not score more than [8 marks].

Post-war developments in the Middle East 1945–2000

21.   Assess the reasons for the establishment and collapse of the United Arab Republic in the years
      1958–1961.

      Reasons for the establishment of the UAR: the spread of the idea of the “Arab nation” in the Middle
      East which needed to be unified to resist foreign interference. Also Israel was perceived to be the
      common enemy and a threat. Defeat in the 1948–1949 war had shown the dangers of disunity.
      Nasser’s reputation post-Suez meant he was a potential leader and made links with Egypt desirable.

      Reasons for collapse: the UAR was formed in 1958 at Syria’s insistence (Syria was small and
      vulnerable but also less hostile to Arab socialism). The political and economic systems were
      merged but problems soon emerged as the government and army were dominated by Egypt.
      Demands for social reform in Syria alienated the elites. The new Iraqi Republic decided not to join
      the UAR thus undermining the notion of the “Arab nation”.

      In 1961 there was an Army coup in Syria aimed at reducing Egyptian influence. Egypt did not
      intervene and the UAR came to an end. Reasons for collapse could include lack of enthusiasm in
      Egypt and an unwillingness by other Arab states to be dominated by Egypt.

      If only “establishment” or “collapse” are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [11 marks].


22.   Analyse the main obstacles to a peace settlement in the Middle East in the years 1978–1995.

      Obstacles include: the unresolved problem of Palestinian refugees, the issue of the occupied
      territories, PLO refusal to recognize Israel’s right to exist (which meant they did not participate in
      the peace process), PLO terrorist activities which meant Israel was unwilling to talk to them.
      Israel’s actions in Lebanon, the unwillingness of any Israeli leader until the election of Rabin in
      1992 to talk to PLO also hindered any attempts at negotiation. Rabin’s election made the first and
      second Oslo Accords possible. Better answers will attempt to reach a judgement on which of these
      factors were the most significant obstacles to peace.

Social and economic developments in Europe and the Middle East in the nineteenth or twentieth
century

23.   Analyse the reasons for the growth of the popular music industry in the years 1950–2000.

      Reasons could include: more leisure time and improved levels of disposable income in more
      affluent societies. Cheaper and more effective means of accessing music which included vinyl
      records, cassettes and CDs. The influence of the media in promoting the music industry, focussing
      on music and musicians. Technological changes which made all genres of popular music accessible
      on a global scale.

      If there is no specific detail to support analytical comments, mark out of a maximum of [8 marks].


24.   With reference to one fifty year period you have studied, discuss the impact of urbanization
      on society.

      Explicit details are required, broad themes that may be explored could include: health issues;
      increased participation in politics. Impact on the social structure – did urbanisation weaken or
      strengthen the class structure? Weakening of family ties because of migration to urban centres.

      Whatever areas are considered they must be supported with evidence and cover a fifty year period.
