Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                                 SECTION A

1.   Health and dentistry

     (a)   (i)    Describe one difference between a local area network (LAN) and a wide
                  area network (WAN).                                                   [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   LAN is within close proximity, (ie home, office, same building or group
                    of buildings close together), whereas a WAN is not restricted to a
                    geographical area
                   WAN connects several LANs together
                   they use different protocols. A LAN transmits to other devices within the
                    network, whereas a WAN uses point to point transmissions between
                    nodes
                   LAN has a high transfer rate, WAN is much slower.

                  Award [1 mark] for identifying one difference and an additional [1 mark]
                  for a brief description up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   The upgraded IT system is a LAN based on a client/server network.
                  Outline the relationship between the client and the server in the
                  upgraded IT system.                                               [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   the server hosts information and programs that are shared to the clients
                    (computers used in the examination rooms by dental hygienist/dentist)
                   the client (computer used by the dental hygienist/dentist) makes a request
                    to the server
                   the server fulfills the request.

                  Award [1 mark] for any aspect of the relationship between the client and the
                  server that is identified. Award an additional [1 mark] if the relationship
                  between the two is outlined.
                                      –5–                N12/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(iii) The developers of the upgraded IT system own the intellectual property
      rights for the system. Define the term intellectual property.          [2 marks]

     Answers may include:
      intellectual property refers to any property that is created using original
       thought
      the creator owns the rights to the artifacts that they created, this includes
       artistic works and ideas
      intellectual property is protected by copyrights, trademarks and patents
      unlike tangible property, rights are not extinguished when the property is
       destroyed
      developers of the IT system own the ideas used in the system (design,
       how it works and what it does). No other developer can create a system
       with these same ideas.

     Award [1 mark] for each of the points stated above up to a maximum of
     [2 marks].
                                             –6–                N12/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Analyse the impacts of implementing the upgraded IT system for the dentist.             [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       access to data – transfer data from paper records to electronic will make access
        easier to data
       access to data – dentist and his staff have faster access to a patient’s electronic
        chart than it is to locate a patient’s paper chart
       queries – dentist will be able to do online search queries for patient information
       simulations – dentist can use the new IT system to show before and after
        simulations so patients can see what their teeth will look like once a procedure
        is completed, or what it will look like if they don’t have a procedure done
       cost – dentist will need to provide training for all office staff, which can be
        costly and time is needed to implement this new system
       backup – if system malfunctions (power outage, server crash, virus), dentist
        requires a backup plan will need to be in place to access patient records
       updates – once the system has been installed, the dentist may want to keep up
        with updates and this might have a cost / involve a risk of having to adapt to
        great changes / assume mistakes of the newer and not tried versions.

      Award marks for impacts for the dentist.

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of
      the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4 marks]
      A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples are used
      within the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the
      response.

      [5–6 marks]
      A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates thorough
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples are used
      throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the
      response.

(c)   To what extent should dentists use simulation software to determine future
      treatment for their patients?                                              [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       dentists can show patients what will happen if they don’t take care of their
        teeth
       dentists can show how a certain procedure could correct their current problem
        with their teeth
       simulations cannot account for all unexpected complications
       simulations can persuade patients into taking care of the situation now, rather
        than later
       if dentists enter incorrect data into the simulation, then the output will not be
        reliable and the patient can be given incorrect information.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

                  Award [1 mark] for data type stated to a maximum of [1 mark].

           (iii) Loan_Length uses a drop-down list with 7, 14 and 21 days. Outline why
                 the drop-down list is used for this field.                            [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   consistency – user cannot input different numbers or formats/prevents
                    users from making mistakes
                   preset values – limits users choices to those provided
                   simplifies process – values are already provided/select options is faster
                    than typing
                   input does not need validation check.

                  Award [1 mark] for outlining each point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (iv) Identify two features of the database query shown below.                        [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   is a derived query / has a calculated field
                   shows three fields of the five / two fields are hidden
                   only selects records where IsJunior value = 0 / does not select records
                    where IsJunior value = –1
                   uses data held in the tblBorrower table
                   only includes borrowers who are under 18 years old the day the query is
                    run
                   uses the DateAdd and Date functions.

                  Award [1 mark] for each feature identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Explain two advantages that digital rights management (DRM), associated
      with the e-books, provides to the Live-brary.                           [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       e-book is encrypted – may need an electronic key to unlock it
       cannot copy and paste the e-book into another program
       e-books do not have to be returned
       cannot keep the e-book
       stops borrowers from sharing the e-book with others when it has been
        downloaded.

      For each explanation:
      Award [1 mark] for an advantage identified.
      For that advantage award up to [2 marks] for an explanation.
      Award a maximum of [3 marks] for explanation of each advantage.

(c)   Live-brary allows borrowers to access free digital content which can be read
      online and be downloaded to read offline. Evaluate both these options.       [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Streaming
       must be online to read the book, constant internet access
       if connection is slow, may have difficulty reading, turning pages
       if connection is lost, unable to read book
       can get access to up-to-date books.
       if the text has links (ie to websites, additional content material), these may be
         followed while reading the online version
       if users are making comments to passages in the book these will be updated
         online and the online reader will be able to access them at any time
       large books may be read online without having to worry about the amount of
         storage space they might take.

      Downloading
       only need to have internet access long enough to download book
       can read the book in areas without internet access once downloaded
       cannot get more books unless internet connection is established
       may require a large amount of storage space on the device used to read the
        e-book offline
       the device’s battery will last longer if the device is not connected to the internet
        while reading the downloaded book (ie provides user with more hours of use
        without recharging, important consideration when travelling)
       books can be read on planes, trains or other places where there is no WiFi
        connection.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

3.   Voice over internet protocol (VOIP)

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of VOIP.                                           [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   a telephone connection over the internet
                   audio data is sent digitally over the internet
                   a system for converting analogue signals to digital so that telephone calls
                    can be made over the internet.

                  Award [1 mark] for each characteristic identified up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].

           (ii)   Define the term protocol.                                                       [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   set of rules/standards/instructions
                   protocols determine specific tasks (ie error checking, method of data
                    compression, when the receiving device has received all of the data,
                    when the sending device has completed the transmission of data)
                   governs the transmission of data
                   protocols specify interactions between devices
                   specific example of protocol (ie FTP).

                  Award [1 mark] for each of the points stated above up to a maximum of

(b)   Analyse the decision of some countries to ban services such as Skype.             [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages for the government:
       economic – countries will lose money if business is taken away from national
        telecom companies
       increased government control over calls and records that happen within their
        country through national telecom companies
       security – data can be more easily intercepted
       reduce the demands caused by Skype on Internet service (ie bandwidth).

      Disadvantages for the government:
       restriction of users’ communication promotes illegal providers of Skype
        to emerge.

      Advantages for the user:
       better national telecom services may emerge because all citizens must use
        these services.

      Disadvantages for the user:
       users could have no alternative to paying excessive fees charged by national
        telecom companies
       anyone attempting to by-pass the law will face consequences such as
        imprisonment or fines
       users may need to travel to neighbouring countries that do not have such
        restrictions to use Skype
       encryption of telephone communication is no longer possible (whereas Skype is
        encrypted so governments do not have easy access to the data).

(c)   In most countries the use of VOIP is legal. Discuss the decision of a business
      in these countries to use VOIP services instead of a conventional
      phone system.                                                                  [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       low cost – can make long distance calls for free, anywhere in the world via
        VOIP
       portable and convenient – can make calls anywhere there is an internet
        connection by signing into your VOIP account
       added features – caller ID, call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail at no charge
        unlike conventional phone systems
       sharing resources – can send picture and documents while you are talking on
        the phone since it uses data lines
       virtual phone number – you can choose a phone number with an area code
        different from where you reside
       group conversations – on a traditional phone line, only two persons can speak
        at a time. With VOIP, you can setup a conference with a whole team
        communicating in real time
       power – internet based phones need power, so they will not work during a
        power outage unlike conventional phones
       emergency calls – emergency services cannot trace the location of a call
        (dangerous if you can’t talk in an emergency) if it is on a data line such
        as VOIP
       sound quality – voice data sent across the internet can experience dropped data
        packets which would cause short periods of silence
       video quality – delay in the video resulting from technical limitations (ie low
        bandwidth either by the sender or receiver, incorrect settings)
       reliability – the distance and speed of the connection affects the reliability of
        the sound arriving
       bandwidth – too much traffic on a network can cause a drop in audio data when
        using VOIP
       security – VOIP may not be as secure as a regular telephone service; phone
        calls may be intercepted as they are transmitted over the internet.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

        health and safety issues
        what if it fails in use?
        look at alternatives – there may be better ways – may be solutions already in
         existence
        may recommend not undertaking project – not all projects are worth it in the
         end.

       can respond to challenges that occur during development
       can incorporate new ideas as the product develops
       leads to the early production of working software modules
       project plans are never perfect – agile encourages a “good enough” approach
       can respond to cost issues
       can try out ideas before committing to them
       encourages iteration with business managers
       can fix bugs as you go
       helps communicate with La Vianda managers
       direct involvement with programmers – encourages pragmatic approach
       encourages change of role in team – common ownership
       faster development
       face to face communication removes guesswork.

      Disadvantages:
       lack of initial plan might lead to inadequate resources being set up
       no definite stages so may be time/cost overrun
       may lead to requirements being left out
       lack of emphasis on design
       lack of emphasis on documentation
       requires clarity from La Vianda managers
       needs experienced developers
       requires developers to be physically present.

      Conclusions:
       this scenario might be part of a bigger system
       small supermarket
       agile will allow new ideas to be incorporated as they develop it.

       Answers may include:
        system depends on data already available on the internet
        likely to be lots of data about well known locations
        a database with the features of known locations can be kept
        location more likely to be recognized because of distinct edges, eg building
         outlines
        locations will maintain their main characteristics
        faces have several different ways depending on the hair, age, facial expression
        a database with everyone’s features is not kept, even though some countries
         may keep digital photographs
        features of locations are public, features of faces may be kept secure by
         institutions who have them
        locations, buildings, may have distinct edges, faces change angles, may join
         other faces
        locations do not move, people do.

(c)   Many schools are using expert systems to help students in making decisions
      about which subjects to take as part of their diploma.

      To what extent is it appropriate to use an expert system as the only method of
      giving advice to a student in their choice of diploma subject?                 [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Suitable:
       it is a suitable domain because a human expert could solve this too
       it is solved repetitively
       removes the need for a human expert
       a quick first stage in the process.

      Unsuitable:
       very limited in response
       only takes into account a limited number of variables
       subject choice may be affected by the personality of the student
       subject choice may be affected by the (perceived) quality of the teacher
       may be better if a human can read some of the more subtle signals.
