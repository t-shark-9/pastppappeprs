1.    (a)   What, according to Source A, contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall
            in 1989?                                                                [3 marks]

             Political instability due to resignations and new politburo / the government needed to
              do something to control the flow of refugees to the Czech Republic;
             Schabowski’s announcement said that the new regulation came into force
              immediately;
             Broadcasts on radio and television led to thousands turning up at checkpoints;
             High numbers of people massing at checkpoints as a result of decision to issue travel
              permits made border controls unworkable;
             There was a lack of communication with border guards.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)    What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                    [2 marks]

             There was no clear consensus about whether or not conditions had improved across
              the former Eastern Bloc;
             There was some difference of opinion within each former Eastern Bloc country;
             The majority of Hungarians and nearly half of Slovaks feel worse off, whilst more
              Czechs and Poles feel better off;
             No country considered there had been an appreciable improvement in their quality of
              life after 1989.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                               –4–              N12/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S3/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about
     Gorbachev’s policies.                                                                 [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources mention that Gorbachev implemented significant change;
      Both sources imply a relaxation of Soviet control over its satellites;
      Both sources state that once change started it rapidly spread to other countries.

     For “contrast”
      Source D mentions that Gorbachev was badly advised, whereas Source C implies that
       Gorbachev is the initiator of change;
      Source D places more emphasis on issues within the Soviet regime, whereas Source C
       focuses more on the relaxation of Soviet control within its satellites;
      Source D focuses on the role of Gorbachev, whereas Source C mentions other factors
       which contributed to the collapse of the Communist regimes.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are
     used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of
     [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source B and Source E for historians studying the consequences of
     Gorbachev’s policies for Eastern European reform movements.                         [6 marks]

     Source B
     Origin:        From Why Did Communism Collapse in 1989? by Charles S Maier.
                    Charles S Maier is currently Professor of History, Harvard University and was
                    Director of the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies 1994–2001.

     Purpose:       To provide contemporary theories regarding the collapse of Communism for
                    students and other academics.

     Value:         As a research essay it will be supported with evidence from sources that were
                    available at the time. The author is a professional academic, and had been
                    director of an institute for European studies suggesting he has detailed
                    knowledge of European affairs. He also subsequently worked as a professor at
                    a highly respected university. As an academic work is may attempt a balanced
                    approach.

     Limitations:   The time lapse between 1989 and January 1991 does not allow for the benefit
                    of hindsight. Additional sources have become available since that date, such as
                    the Soviet Archives.

     Source E
     Origin:        From an attitude survey carried out by Pew Research Centre in a number of
                    former Communist states, 1991.

     Purpose:       To obtain the views of a sample of people living in some Eastern European
                    countries as to whether they thought that their economic situation shortly after
                    1989 was better, worse, or about the same as it had been under Communism.

     Value:         Provided that the survey was independent / has been carried out properly and is
                    representative it can give statistical information to support academic theories.
                    It offers an insight into how people in different former communist states felt
                    shortly after the fall of communism.

     Limitations:   Direct comparisons between the countries may not be possible, as it is not
                    known whether the data was obtained using consistent sampling methods.
                    The research had to have been carried out in a relatively short timeframe. Not
                    all former communist states are represented. The fact that Pew Research
                    Centre is based in the USA may be seen by candidates as a limitation.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.    Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the reasons for the
      collapse of Communism by the end of 1989.                                         [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A     This indicates that the opening of the Berlin Wall was necessary to prevent the
                  flow of refugees to the Czech Republic, causing a breach in the Iron Curtain.
                  There was some degree of accident with regard to its timing as a result of a lack
                  of thought on the part of Schabowski and a lack of communication with the
                  border guards.

     Source B      This source blames the collapse of Communism on divergent economic
                   policies between East and West, the latter supported by the United States which
                   was relatively unscathed after the Second World War. There had been no
                   economic reforms and limited scope for growth within COMECON.

     Source C      This source maintains that there were a number of factors: Gorbachev’s
                   perestroika, the Sinatra Doctrine replacing the Brezhnev Doctrine and a
                   “snowball effect” starting with Poland.

     Source D      This source maintains that Gorbachev attempted to achieve too much and lost
                   control, having been given poor advice with the partial exception of foreign
                   policy.

     Source E      This source suggests that in some countries, such as Czechoslovakia and
                   Poland, economic difficulties may have been a contributing factor to the
                   collapse of Communism.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge may include: details of economic failure and ideological decay within the
     USSR and in any of the East-Central European countries; relevant events in the USSR
     including details on glasnost and perestroika, in Hungary – the border fence with Austria
     taken down, Poland and Solidarity, Czechoslovakia and Charter 77, East Germany and
     Honecker, and Romania and the violent overthrow of Ceausescu; details of nation-specific
     factors. Credit any relevant material relating to any Eastern Bloc country or answers which
     outline the sequence of events, including the role of the Reagan administration, with analysis
     focusing on the question.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
