Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools of
thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations.
Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Compare and contrast two of the following theoretical schools of thought in relation to ethnography:

      • political economy
      • functionalism
      • cultural ecology.


2.    Discuss the advantages and limitations of adopting a synchronic perspective.


3.    Evaluate how two ethnographers incorporate one theoretical perspective into their work.


4.    Examine how either a structure-centred or an agency-centred perspective has helped to better
      understand one of the following:

      • globalization
      • gender
      • power.


5.    Evaluate either a cohesion-centred or a conflict-centred perspective of one ethnographer.
