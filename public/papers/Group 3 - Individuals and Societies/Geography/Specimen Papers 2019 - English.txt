Option A — Freshwater

1.   (a)   Briefly describe two natural features of the river Rio Grande de Santiago
           downstream from the settlement of La Presa (grid square 3721).                            [2]

           Award [1] for describing each characteristic.

           For example: Several (five or six) well-developed meanders [1], a small
           ox-bow lake around 100 m from the main channel [1].

           Only award a maximum of [1] for two stated features without description
           (“Meander. Ox-bow lake.”).

     (b)   Outline one possible threat to this area’s wetlands.                                      [2]

           Award [1] for identifying a natural or human threat.
           Award [1] for further outlining or exemplification.

           For instance: “Climate change might bring reduced rainfall to this part of Mexico
           [1], this could result in the land no longer being saturated for many months of the
           year [1].

     (c)   Referring to map evidence, suggest three ways in which local people might
           benefit economically from this area’s wetlands and/or river landforms.                [2+2+2]

           Award [1] for a valid economic benefit and [1] for use of supporting map
           evidence. Possible benefits of wetlands and/or river landforms include: tourism,
           nature reserves, farming, aquaculture, natural flood defences.

           For example: Square 3618 contains an extensive wetland area [1] which might
           attract nature tourists who spend money staying in larger settlements such as La
           Presa [1].

2.   (a)   Examine the impacts of human activity on river hydrographs.                           [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Response of hydrograph should be addressed in terms of lag time, peak
           discharge, rising and recessional limb, overland flow/throughflow contributions,
           etc.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            answers may refer to the reasons for the rapid response areas in which
             human activity is present, for example, in urban areas due to lack of
             interception, impermeable surfaces (roads, roofs, paving), thereby reducing
             infiltration, and the presence of artificial and rapid drainage channels (drains,
             sewers, flood channels). Urbanization is used to explain the effects on the
             rapid rising limb, high peak discharge and rapid falling limb on account of
             overland flow/runoff
            other reasons would be due to changes to land use, agricultural practices,
             deforestation/afforestation. The slower and lower response in a vegetated or
             forested area could be explained by higher interception, the retention of water
             by litter, absorption by root systems, high soil and bedrock permeability.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the relative importance of the impacts
           of different human activities, or possible interactions between them. Another
           approach might be to examine the different time scales over which impacts are
           experienced eg urbanization occurs over a far longer time period compared with
           the seasonal effects of agriculture (vegetation cover removal and compacting of
           soil).

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the impact of human
           activity on hydrographs.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
            either well-evidenced explanation of the impact of human activity on
             hydrographs
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

2.   (b)   Evaluate the contribution individuals and communities can make towards
           minimizing their area’s vulnerability to water scarcity.                               [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Physical water scarcity is where water resource development reaches
           unsustainable levels. Economic water scarcity is where water is available locally
           but not accessible for human reasons.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            water saving/rationing/recycling/re-use are strategies which can be led by
             individuals and communities, but may also be promoted by local and national
             government
            water harvesting (eg use of rainwater barrels) can make a very important
             contribution towards building community resilience especially in more arid
             areas
            farmers/gardeners may adopt drought-resistant crops/plants
            individuals and communities have a role to play in supporting or challenging
             integrated drainage basin management, or the introduction of dams and
             reservoirs. The importance of their contribution will depend on the context
             presented as evidence.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that is carefully structured
           around different aspects of vulnerability eg the varying power of individuals,
           households, farmers or industries to make a difference in this context. There
           may not be a possibility of entirely eradicating risks/vulnerability, and this might
           be commented on. So too might climate change and changing physical
           processes which cannot be easily tackled due to their scale, or human issues
           such as corruption.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of water scarcity
           vulnerability and the contribution/actions of individuals/communities.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
            either well-evidenced explanation of water scarcity vulnerability and the
             contribution/actions of individuals/communities
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option B — Oceans and coastal margins

3.   (a)   Referring to the aerial photograph, describe two features that show that the
           shape of this coastline has been modified due to human intervention.                     [2+2]

           Award [1] for identification of the feature, naming or describing the
           intervention/modification, and [1] for further development such as location,
           shape, building material or how it functions/works.

           For example:
            unusually straight and/or narrow “headland” type features [1] running
             perpendicular to the coast between successive bays [1]
            offshore seawalls, groynes or breakwaters [1] running parallel to the coastline
             or man-made jetty [1]
            regular-shaped bays [1] of similar proportions, almost equally spaced over
             only a short distance [1].

     (b)   Referring to the aerial photograph, explain three possible benefits to
           human activity that have resulted from modifying this coastline.                       [2+2+2]

           Award [1] for identifying a benefit and further [1] for development.

           For example: Greater protection for low-lying infrastructure, buildings, hotels, and
           yachts against storms [1] because wave strength will be diminished inside bays
           by this pattern of bays and headlands [1].

           Other possible benefits or advantages may include:
            creation of new land, and a longer coastline, with more waterfront may raise
             land prices and allow more building sites and development
            the headlands and creation of bays where waves will be refracted creates
             areas that are safer for beach activities and swimming
            reducing distance between “headlands” may allow for entrance to one or more
             bays to be “netted”, decreasing risk of jellyfish/shark attacks and increasing
             swimmer safety
            the artificially extended coastline may provide the ideal conditions for the
             development of an artificial reef in the future which would bring a new water-
             based attraction to this area.
                                                  –8–              SPEC/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   (a)   Examine the environmental and economic impacts of El Niño events.                     [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           El Niño is officially defined as a sustained sea surface temperature anomaly
           across the central tropical Pacific Ocean (lasts 2 to 7 years).

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            El Niño events are associated with warm and very wet summers (December to
             February) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador, with the economic
             costs of major flooding hazards whenever the event is strong or extreme
            further afield, El Niño events also result in drier conditions in parts of
             Southeast Asia and parts of Australia and the economic impacts of this,
             including bush fires, can also be addressed. On the other hand, fewer tropical
             cyclones in the western Pacific reduces the economic impacts from storm
             hazards in those areas
            changes to ocean currents can affect local fishing industries along affected
             coastlines (for instance, Peruvian anchovies may migrate south to Chilean
             waters)
            El Niño events can also have impacts which extend well beyond the Pacific
             region.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the statement in a way that considers
           different types of place (context), or the impacts of different physical processes.
           There is a possibility of both positive and negative impacts in both instances, and
           the time scale these operate on might also be examined.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two valid impacts of
           El Niño events/hazards.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes
            either well-evidenced explanation of three or more valid impacts of El Niño
             events/hazards
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

4.   (b)   Examine why the ownership of oceanic resources is often disputed.                     [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Oceanic resources include both biotic and abiotic resources. There are a range
           of possible challenges arising from competition over oceanic resources, and they
           often lead to dispute between states.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            sovereignty rights and territorial limits where there are competing claims over
             the ocean and its resources, eg China and the Philippines
            ownership of islands, coastal margins and their territorial resources
            the Arctic Ocean and competition from Arctic Circle nations over ownership of
             ocean floor resources including fossil fuels
            conflict over fishing and competing perspectives over ownership of a resource
             that forms part of “the global commons”.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the statement in a way that considers
           different types and scales of dispute or conflict between nations and places.
           Another approach might be to show how different countries/organizations/interest
           groups have varying perspectives on who, if anyone, can lay claim to ocean
           resources. There is also a possibility of some disputes persisting due to a failure
           to agree sovereignty rights in disputed regions.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two relevant
           disputes.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
            either well-evidenced explanation of two relevant disputes
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option C — Extreme environments

5.   (a)   State two additional physical impacts that could be included in box A.             [1+1]

           Award [1] for stating each possible physical impact.

           For example: Loss of biodiversity, reduced productivity, migration of species,
           salinization.

     (b)   State two additional human impacts that could be included in box B.                [1+1]

           Award [1] for stating each possible human impact.

           For example: Environmental refugees/migration, falling crop yields/carrying
           capacity reduced, conflict over land.

     (c)   Referring to the diagram, suggest one reason why it can be hard to slow down
           the desertification process.                                                         [2]

           Award [1] for a valid human or physical reason and [1] for further
           development/exemplification.

           For example: Desertification of some places means that cattle are moved to other
           previously unaffected areas [1]. However, these other areas may become
           desertified as a result and so the process does not slow down overall [1].

     (d)   Explain how overgrazing can lead to desertification.                                 [4]

           Award [1] for each valid explanatory statement and [1] for each further
           development/exemplification.

           For example: Overgrazing means more vegetation is removed over a period of
           time by grazing animals than can regrow [1]. Removal of vegetation and
           prevention of sufficient replacement growth means fewer roots to hold soil
           together [1]. Less vegetation means overgrazing will accelerate if the number of
           grazing animals is not diminished [1]. Trampling of ground that is not protected
           by vegetation can lead to compaction and further reduced vegetation growth. [1]
           This downward cycle of land degradation is desertification.

6.   (a)   Examine the opportunities and challenges associated with tourism in cold
           extreme environments.                                                                [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The focus of the response should be on the cold extreme environment and the
           opportunities and challenges that it poses for tourism.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            opportunities for tourism include the aesthetic value, the physical
             characteristics of the environment (eg relief) that – in spite of being a
             challenge for the local population – present unique possibilities for selected
             tourist activities
            other opportunities include economic gains, protection of fragile areas,
             employment of local populations, possibility of different forms of recreation
            challenges include pressure on resources, land degradation and slower
             recovery rates, waste disposal, vulnerability to and frequency of hazards, the
             seasonal nature of tourism. Responses may consider other factors, including
             social, economic, political, demographic, and cultural factors
            the physical challenge of construction (in permafrost areas) could also be
             considered.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the variety and balance of challenges
           and opportunities in varying places, at different scales and in varying geographic
           contexts eg polar as opposed to tundra regions or different economic
           development contexts. They may also examine the time scale over which
           tourism develops. Another approach might be to look at how interactions with
           other places can help or harm tourism.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one relevant
           opportunity and one relevant challenge.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
            either well-evidenced explanation of relevant opportunities and challenges (do
             not expect perfect balance)
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

6.   (b)   Examine the relative importance of glacial (ice) erosion and deposition for
           the development of glacial troughs and moraines.                                     [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The focus of the response should be on both erosional and depositional
           processes and their associated landforms. Although some landforms owe their
           character mainly to erosion or deposition, many landforms have developed over
           time as a result of both erosion and deposition. For example, glacial troughs
           were carved by erosion but have also experienced deposition subsequently on
           the valley floor.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            glacial trough formation may be accounted for using knowledge of erosional
             processes (plucking, abrasion). Depositional processes also play a role in
             shaping the landform (till depositional or ground moraine)
            moraines are predominantly depositional features (lateral, medial and terminal
             moraines). However, the material itself could not have been produced without
             erosion and also valley-side weathering.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the statement in a way that shows
           understanding of the complex interactions between erosional and depositional
           processes that are responsible for landform development (rather than explaining
           the landforms as being purely erosional or depositional in origin). Another
           approach might be to examine changing processes over different time scales (eg
           periods of glacial advance and retreat).

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of erosion and
           deposition processes in relation to two relevant landforms (trough and one type of
           moraine).

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
            either well-evidenced explanation of erosion and deposition processes, and
             their influence on three relevant landforms (trough and more than one type of
             moraine)
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option D — Geophysical hazards

7.   (a)   Referring to the diagram, state the characteristics of a rotational slide.             [2]

           semi-liquid/medium moisture content [1]
           range of speeds from fast to medium [1]

     (b)   Outline one situation in which a mud flow would be classified as a secondary hazard.   [2]

           Award [1] for a valid situation (most likely the occurrence of a primary hazard
           such as an earthquake or storm event) and [1] for further
           development/exemplification.

           For example: “An earthquake occurs (primary hazard) [1] and this triggers a
           landslide [1].

     (c)   Distinguish between the strategies used to manage the risks of rock falls and
           soil creep.                                                                            [6]

           Rock falls (as shown by the diagram) are fast/sudden/unpredictable [1] whereas
           soil creep is slow/steady/can be monitored [1].

           The remaining marks are allocated for details of actual strategies for the two
           hazards (both must be addressed). Award [1] for each strategy and [1] for
           further development or exemplification.

           Possibilities include:
            netting or gabions to stabilize cliffs
            removal of loose cliff material
            vegetation/control of grazing animals to stabilize soils
            walls to retain/stabilize creeping soils.

           For example: “Land-zoning to avoid areas of unpredictable rock fall [1] eg
           temporary closing of Chapman’s Peak in Cape Town [1].”

8.   (a)   Examine the role of plate margin type in determining the severity of volcanic hazards.   [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Different processes operate at destructive and constructive margins, resulting in
           different hazard events for inhabited areas.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            destructive margins are usually more dangerous due to viscosity of lava and
             explosive events. Constructive margins are usually associated with less
             violent, effusive eruptions
            important aspects of eruptions also include pyroclastic flows, tephra ejection
             and gas release
            many additional factors affect severity of hazards. Secondary hazards (snow
             melt, mass movements) may play a role. The scale of the eruption also
             matters (including “supervolcano” events at volcanic hotspots)
            human factors may be most important however: the number of people
             affected, their vulnerability, the presence of mitigation measures and use of
             technology all play a role.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the statement in a way that shows
           understanding of the relative power of physical and human factors to determine
           outcomes in different contexts, places and over varied time scales. Another
           approach might be to examine who technology is creating new possibilities for
           monitoring volcanoes (GPS sensors on cones), meaning that access to
           technology is becoming the most important factor.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two plate margin
           types, and a relevant hazard for each type.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
            either well-evidenced explanation of two plate margin types and their relevant
             hazards
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

8.   (b)   Evaluate the success of attempts to predict tectonic hazard events and
           their possible impacts.                                                             [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Tectonic hazard events include volcanoes, earthquakes, mass movements and
           secondary hazards that follow from any of these. There are also different
           types/aspects of volcanic hazards to consider.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
            prediction can range from long-term (using recurrence intervals to consider the
             likelihood of an event in a given year) to short-term attempts (spotting signs
             that suggest an event is immanent). Events in places that are extensively
             monitored are more likely to be predicted than events in places that are less
             populated/studied
            in recent years, some events have been successfully identified using
             technology such as GPS crater monitoring. Signals such as minor
             earthquakes, gas release and possibly animal behaviour have some track
             record of success. “Swarms” of small earthquakes may help suggest the
             arrival a large earthquake (eg L’Aquila in Italy)
            a distinction can be drawn between predicting an event and predicting what its
             impacts will be in terms of damages and losses.

           Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement that shows critical understanding of
           what “success” might mean in different geographic contexts and places (eg it
           might be measured by the number of lives saved or the value of property saved).
           Another approach might be to evaluate the success of attempts to calculate
           statistical probability compared with the success to pinpoint the exact day when
           an event may occur (process complexity). Another approach might be to
           evaluate how far perspectives may differ on what constitutes a “success”
           especially in relation to events of varying scale.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two attempts to
           predict a valid hazard event should be described.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
            either well-evidenced explanation of a range of relevant attempts to predict
             hazards
            or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option E — Leisure, tourism and sport

9.   (a)   Briefly describe the global pattern shown by the graph.                                        [2]

           Asia has the most wins [1]
           Australasia has second largest number of wins [1]
           Europe and Africa have fewer [1]
           Variations within regions – Europe has larger range than Australasia [1]

     (b)   State two possible political factors influencing where the event might take
           place in any year.                                                                           [1+1]

           Possibilities include:
            government support and investment
            corruption
            sanctions against other countries
            lack of conflict/political security.

     (c)   Suggest three reasons for the low number of games won by some of the
           countries shown on the graph.                                                              [2+2+2]

           Award [1] for each reason suggested, such as the financial costs of training and
           facilities, social attitudes favouring particular sports, recent entry to the event (not
           all countries may have joined in 1975). Award [1] for further development,
           exemplification or use of the graph (including quantification).

           For instance: “Some low income countries may lack the money to invest
           in training facilities [1], this could explain why Kenya has only scored
           6 wins [1].”

10.   (a)   Evaluate the costs and benefits of tourism as a national development strategy.      [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Tourism is an important development strategy for many high, middle and low-
            income countries. Its use helps diversify economies which may have been over-
            dependent on raw materials and commodities.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
             costs and benefits can be economic, social, cultural or environmental and
              operate on different time scales. For instance, developed
              high-income countries may also gain from using tourism as a
              post-industrial strategy to help with sustainable economic development in the
              long-term
             sustainable ecotourism is an increasingly popular national strategy that
              attempts to maximise benefits and minimise costs across a range of criteria
             knowledge of important specialist concepts like carrying capacity, threshold
              and cultural dilution can be used to support an answer.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that reaches an evidenced
            judgement or shows understanding that perspectives may differ on whether costs
            outweigh benefits (eg views of people who may have been displaced by
            infrastructure projects). Another approach might be to evaluate the temporal or
            spatial scale over which costs and benefits are experienced (they may not be the
            same), or to question the underlying assumptions about what a “national
            development strategy” involves (economic development goals may be met more
            easily than social ones, for instance).

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one relevant cost
            and one relevant benefit.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
             either well-evidenced explanation of a range of relevant costs and benefits (do
              not expect balance)
             or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

10.   (b)   Examine the impacts of one or more festivals on surrounding rural area(s).             [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            The Geography subject guide defines festivals as “musical, religious or sporting
            events of temporary duration”. Some festivals may be held in remote/wilderness
            areas whereas others may be in the rural-urban fringe (example/s of each are
            acceptable).

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
             economic benefits and multiplier effects enjoyed by surrounding areas and
              their populations
             negative consequences of exceeding carrying capacity in fragile rural areas,
              such as trampling and soil erosion
             pollution of waterways, congestion of traffic leading to noise and air pollution,
              littering and the disposal of non-recyclable materials
             cultural changes as local populations encounter tourists and visitors
              (especially true of youth-orientated events)
             development of infrastructure to transport and accommodate visitors, bringing
              landscape changes.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the relative severity of different
            negative impacts eg there is a possibility that the environment is resilient because
            the impacts are temporary. Another approach might be to examine the
            sustainability of economic processes (visitors are only there for a few days).
            Another approach might be to examine how some neighbouring places benefit
            more than others or suffer more adverse impacts eg next to roads or areas that
            planners have allowed the festival to be sited next to. Perspectives of different
            stakeholders are likely to differ on how the net overall impact is viewed.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two relevant impacts.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
             either well-evidenced explanation of a range of relevant impacts
             or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option F — Food and health

11.   (a)   Referring to the map, describe the pattern of female health-adjusted life
            expectancy (HALE) in African countries north of the equator.                               [2]

            Award [2] for two valid descriptions, one of which must be quantified.

            Possibilities include:
             the northern coastline is where it is highest/lower towards the equator
             two coastal north African countries are especially high (65–69)
             the lowest scores are often found inland.

      (b)   Outline one reason why female health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE)
            remains below 50 years in some countries.                                                  [2]

            Award [1] for a stated reason and [1] for further outlining or exemplification which
            demonstrates understanding of what HALE measures.

            For example: “Debilitating diseases/conditions eg hookworm affect many women
            in some sub-Saharan countries [1]. As a result, women lose many years of
            healthy life resulting in a low HALE score [1].”

            Other possibilities include:
             complications resulting from childbirth in countries where medial infrastructure
              is lacking
             sickness linked with poor nutrition and compromised immunity.

      (c)   Explain two disadvantages and one advantage of using HALE as an indicator
            of the health of the populations of the countries shown on the map.                    [2+2+2]

            Award [1] for each disadvantage/advantage and [1] for further development or
            exemplification.

            Possibilities include:
            Disadvantages
             it is an average [1] so doesn’t show regional/racial/urban-rural contrast [1]
             governments might not record data or not record it accurately [1] so data is
               unreliable/unavailable [1].

            Advantages
             HALE includes an adjustment for time spent in ill health due to disease and/or
              injury [1]. This is an advantage compared with the crude measure of life
              expectancy when studying development/disparities/comparing places [1]
             can be used to help countries plan for health provision [1] which is especially
              advantageous for developing countries whose governments have limited
              public spending [1].

12.   (a)   Evaluate the role of agribusinesses and new technologies in increasing
            world food supply.                                                                  [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Agribusinesses include some of the world’s largest TNCs: Del Monte, Cargill, etc.
            These companies operate on a global scale and control significant amounts of
            global food trade. New technologies may include fertilisers, pesticides,
            machinery and GM crops. Solar powered irrigation systems are used
            increasingly in Morocco and South Africa.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
             agribusinesses they operate economies of scale that may increase overall
              food supply; and are at the forefront of use of a range of technologies,
              including fertilizers, pesticides, machinery and GM crops to maximize output
              and crop yield
             new and emerging technologies may also be available to smallholders and
              cooperatives, and not just TNCs. However, funding is required (microloans
              have played an important role in helping may smallholders to modernize in
              recent years, from Malawi to Bangladesh)
             other actors and factors play a role too in influencing food supply. These
              could include governments (policies for waste reduction), charities and even
              climate change (which may act to increase food supply in some areas such as
              northern Europe).

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of
            the power agribusinesses hold in relation to other actors and stakeholders.
            Another approach might be to focus on the interactions between agribusiness
            and technology and to evaluate the importance of the ways in which they
            intersect. Perspectives may differ on whether the role of agribusiness and new
            technology is ultimately viewed positively or negatively depending on the
            importance different stakeholders attach to issues such as biodiversity and local
            land ownership. Perspectives may also differ on whether agribusiness of
            technology has the greater role.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of how agribusinesses
            and one relevant technology have affected world food supply.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
             either well-evidenced explanation of how agribusinesses and relevant
              technologies have affected world food supply
             or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

12.   (b)   Examine the relationship between food security and health.                             [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Food security relates to the supply of food to societies and individuals. It can be
            achieved domestically through increased output and improved distribution; or
            through trade and imports.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
             poor food security results in health problems linked with famine, underweight
              children and malnutrition. Susceptibility to disease increases in these cases
              due to a weakened immune system
             food security does not necessarily improve all aspects of health, whoever. A
              distinction can still be made between improved national food security and the
              obstacles that may yet exist to effective food distribution at the local/village
              level
             high-income countries where food is readily and cheaply available often
              develop “diseases of affluence” and health concerns such as diabetes (almost
              half a billion people globally now suffer from this).

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the statement in a way that shows
            understanding of the non-linear and complex interactions between food and
            health. This is, for instance, demonstrated by the rising possibility of diseases of
            affluence in many countries. Another approach might be to examine the
            relationship at different geographical scales, from global to local.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two ways in which
            food security/supply and people’s health are linked.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
             either well-evidenced explanation of ways in which food security/supply and
              people’s health are linked
             or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option G — Urban environments

13.   (a)   State the compass direction from the city centre to the airport.                              [1]

            North east

      (b)   Estimate the furthest distance north that can be travelled in 30 minutes by
            car from the city centre.                                                                     [1]

            40 km (allow 36 to 44)

      (c)   State two possible reasons why places that are the same distance from the
            city centre have different driving times.                                                   [1+1]

            Award [1] for each reason.

            Possibilities include: Superior road network, flatter land for easier travel, levels of
            congestion in different areas, presence of traffic calming measures or traffic
            lights.

      (d)   Suggest three reasons, other than driving time, why housing in zones A and D
            is more expensive than housing in other zones.                                            [2+2+2]

            Award [1] for each reason and [1] for further development/explanation.

            For full marks, suggestions must be made for both zones A and D.

            For example: “There may be environmental reasons why zone D is expensive [1]
            such as the quality of the schools or proximity to city parks [1].”

            Other possible reasons include:
             land prices may be so high in the centre (zone A) that only very expensive
              homes can be justified if/when land is redeveloped
             zones B and C may be deindustrialised areas which have yet to be
              redeveloped and suffer from high rates of dereliction or crime.

14.   (a)   Evaluate two or more strategies designed to improve the sustainability
            of cities. [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            The sustainability of cities has environmental, economic and social dimensions.
            Strategies can take many forms depending on the focus for actions (eg economy
            or environment). Some strategies aim to limit growth; others seek to enable
            growth but in more sustainable ways.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
             resilient cities, eco-cities and “smart cities” use technology and design to help
              meet environmental and social challenges whilst also delivering new
              employment opportunities
             measures to address housing, sanitation and health issues, which many
              planners will view as the most important aspect of urban sustainability
             economic development initiatives can also be credited if they are clearly
              focused on delivering economic and social sustainability in the long-term
             environmental measures eg traffic controls have social benefits and can help
              attract new economic investment as city image in improved
             the desirability of strategies (and their outcomes) may not be agreed on by all
              user groups; some strategies may target one aspects of sustainability (eg the
              environment) but lack a holistic approach that also meets social needs.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement in a way that shows understanding of
            the different contexts and challenges faced by city planners in different places
            and contexts. Housing provision may be easier to deliver is established cities
            with low growth than in emerging megacities in Africa or Asia where demographic
            processes offer a greater challenge to planners. Another approach might be to
            evaluate the extent to which different sustainability goals can interact virtuously
            with another (environmental improvement in post-industrial cities may help attract
            investment and migration, for instance). Planning-led gentrification processes
            can be evaluated from different perspectives.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two relevant
                 strategies.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
             either well-evidenced explanation of two relevant strategies
             or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
                                                  – 24 –            SPEC/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


14.   (b)   Examine the patterns of urban stress that have developed in one or
            more named cities.                                                                    [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Urban stress can relate to pollution (air and noise), the depletion of green space,
            traffic congestion, economic stress (unemployment) and crime or social disorder.
            Patterns of stress may be spatial or social (and the two are linked through the
            social geography of neighbourhoods).

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
             the effects of human activity on urban microclimate and the health stresses
              this creates in particular places
             pollution and the effect of prevailing winds and other meteorological conditions
              on urban environmental and social stress
             consequences of inadequate sewage and waste disposal systems for urban
              populations, especially in particular development contexts
             overcrowding, traffic congestion and noise, and the patterns of stress that
              develop (linked with major road arteries)
             urban patterns of social deprivation, crime and inequality (linked with the
              distribution of housing areas or zones)
             stress patterns are dynamic and change over time or in response to
              management
             clear differences emerge depending on context: developing world megacities
              may suffer the worst stress while regulation/governance and reduced incomer
              pressure help to ameliorate stress in affluent cities and neighbourhoods.

            Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) which examines the statement in a way that shows
            understanding of how stresses vary according to place and context. Another
            approach might be to examine the interactions between different patterns of
            stress eg multiple deprivation, and how these interactions may develop over time.
            Another approach might be to examine how patterns of stress reflect the power of
            some groups to control/use land markets and therefore distance themselves from
            pollution/crime/stress.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two relevant
            patterns.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account which includes:
             either well-evidenced explanation of two relevant patterns
             or a discursive conclusion (or on-going evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

     (a)   (i)    Identify the minimum population size needed for an urban area to be classified
                  as a megacity.                                                                          [1]

                  10 million inhabitants.

           (ii)   Identify the two nations that are predicted to have the greatest number of
                  megacities in 2030.                                                                     [1]

           Possible statements include:
            falling birth rates
            reduced levels of immigration
            counter-urbanisation.

     (c)   Explain two possible negative consequences for the cities projected to experience
           very rapid growth.                                                                         [2 + 2]

           Award [1] for each valid negative consequence be it social, economic or
           environmental and another [1] for development or exemplification.

           eg A strain on the existing infrastructure [1] resulting in increased traffic congestion
           [1] or vice versa.

           Other possibilities could include:
            Lack of employment opportunities
            Housing shortages and the growth of informal settlements
            Crime from growing inequality
            Increased air pollution.

(d)   Explain one reason why a country could experience a demographic dividend.              [2]

      Award [1] for each valid distinct reason and another [1] for development/ or
      exemplification.

      The DD is accelerated economic growth that may result from a decline in a country’s
      birth and death rates and the subsequent change in the age structure of the
      population – Population Reference Bureau.

      eg an increase in the proportion of the working age population [1] as a result of
      falling fertility/birth rates [1].

      Other possibilities include:
       reduced mortality rates increasing the proportion in the working age group
       correctly describing the appropriate change in the structure of the population age
        structure of the population
       change in dependency ratio/ working age increases relative to the youthful
        population.

2.   Global climate – vulnerability and resilience

     (a)   State two naturally occurring greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide.                    [1]

           Must have two of the following for [1]:
            Methane
            Nitrous oxide
            Water vapour
            Tropospheric/ground level ozone.

     (b)   Explain two positive feedback loops that contribute to climate change.                   [3 + 3]

           Award [1] for a factor, [1] for consequences and [1] for an explanation of the
           feedback loop.

           Possibilities include:

           eg Arctic ice melts reducing albedo [1] less incoming solar radiation is reflected [1]
           and this increases further melting of Arctic ice [1].

           eg Increased temperatures result in greater evaporation [1] more water vapour in
           the atmosphere acting as a greenhouse gas [1] leads to increased temperature [1].

           eg Melting tundra releases methane [1] methane is a GHG [1] and so temperature
           rises [1] and more tundra melts.

     (c)   State and explain one geopolitical attempt to reduce the challenges posed by global
           climate change.                                                                          [1 + 2]

           A valid geopolitical strategy should be identified [1]
           The remaining [2] should be reserved for an explanation of the strategy.

           For example: international agreements on emissions eg Kyoto 1997 [1]. This
           means that the signing nation states have agreed to cut GHG emissions [1] this will
           reduce the enhanced GHE [1] reducing global warming.

           Other possibilities include:
            sharing technology
            development of alternative energies
            actions of MGOs eg feed-in tariffs on renewable energy
            international aid.

3.   Global resource consumption and security

     (a)   Describe the pattern of the ecological footprint shown on the map.                       [2]

           Any two valid statements for [1]; effective use of data [1].

           Possible statements include:
            highest in Australia – over 6 gha
            lowest in south Asia/south-east Asia/Oceania – below 1.19 gha
            Russia/northern Asia has a middle range value – 2 to 5.9 gha.

     (b)   Suggest two reasons for the changing importance of nuclear power.                    [2 + 2]

           Award [1] for a valid suggestion and [1] for development/exemplification

           For example: Safety concerns regarding potential accidents [1] eg the Fukushima incident in
           Japan [1].

           Concerns about future energy security [1] many believe nuclear energy is the only
           valid alternative future energy that will meet the growing demand [1].

           Other possibilities:
            technology has made this a much safer option
            contributes less to GHG
            issues with storage of waste as radioactive for a long time
            expensive alternative compared to other forms of energy.

     (c)   Explain two characteristics of the circular economy.                                 [2 + 2]

           Award [1] for each valid characteristic and [1] for development/exemplification.

           For example: consumers rent products from companies instead of buying them [1]
           which means responsibility for recycling when the product eventually breaks lies
           with the company [1].

            Other possibilities include:
            researchers are developing new “cradle to cradle” design ideas
            materials designed to be used again and again
            materials are kept circulating (in flows) and do not enter landfill
            people become product users rather than consumers.

                                                Section B
4.   (a)   State the number of locations that:

           (i)    have future plans for nuclear power;                                                 [1]

                  Eight.

           (ii)   already have hydroelectric power.                                                    [1]

                  Twenty nine.

     (b)   Suggest one way in which the bar graph depicting electricity generation and
           population by region could be improved.                                                     [2]

           Award [1] for each valid point and [1] for development.

           Possibilities include:
            would be better if like was compared with like [1] and Africa is a continent not a
             country – others are all countries [1]
            the title should indicate the type of energy sources used in generating electricity
             [1], ie renewable electricity generation or all electricity generation [1]
            The graph would be more effective if it showed electricity generation per capita
             rather than kilowatts [1] because larger countries may have more electricity
             generation/needs [1].

     (c)   Evaluate two ways in which Africa is portrayed negatively in this infographic, other
           than in the bar graph.                                                                  [3 + 3]

           Award [1] for each negative portrayal identified, and up to [2] for each effective
           evaluation of why this is a negative portrayal.

           For example:
           Use of images – the two “no entry/prohibition” signs [1] seem to portray no
           lighting/lightbulbs/ electricity in Africa [1], and this is incorrect/misleading [1].

           Tone of language in box in top left corner, eg “unable to scrounge up the money,
           resources, and general know-how to bring energy to their people” [1] – this is very
           patronizing, over-simplistic and insulting use of language about Africa [1] which is
           made up of over 50 diverse countries [1].

           Possible areas for evaluation include:
            tone of language
            use of terminology
            use of labels and headings
            sources used
            generalizations
            use of images
            use of colour
            use of data
            intended audience
            scales and proportions or projection of the map
            effectiveness of the key.

                                             Section C
5.   “Climate change will eventually become the main reason for human migration.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?                                                     [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 2–3.

     Reponses may tackle the question on a regional or global scale. They should have a
     clear understanding of the terms “climate change” and “migration” and comment on the
     direct links or lack of links between the two using a well-developed case study/studies or
     developed example(s).

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      Climate change can be explained as a possible cause of migration (push/pull) at local,
       national or regional scales, for example: drought, increased meteorological hazards
       and/or rising sea levels.
      The findings of climate change predictions and projections (IPCC reports) can be
       explained, along with the eventual implications for population migration.
      Responses may also describe migrations which have limited links to climate change eg
       with economic or political push/pull factors as opposed to environmental.
      Responses may make describe the unprecedented number of refugees and economic
       migrants who are now living in countries where they were not born.

     Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) which evaluates the relative importance of climate change or other
     economic/political factors in causing migration. Another approach might be to focus on
     possible interactions between different factors (conflicts causing mass movement of
     people may have climate change as one of their long term causes). Another approach
     might be to examine the different time scales over which impacts are experienced or could
     comment that climate change is often difficult to identify as a push factor as many
     migrations happen for a package of reasons, which are all, interlinked.

     For 5–6 marks
     Expect weakly-evidenced outlining of climate change and/or migration themes.

     For 7–8 marks
     Expect a well-structured account which includes:
      EITHER a well evidenced synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
       climate change and migration themes from the Guide
      OR a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks
     Expect both traits.

6.   “Energy security is the most important aspect of resource security for nations.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?                                                       [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 2–3.

     Reponses may tackle the question on a national, regional or global scale. They should
     have a clear understanding of the terms “energy security” and “resource security” and
     comment on the links between the two using well-developed case studies or developed
     examples.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):
      Responses may explain that the “importance” of energy security depends on the nation
       in question due to differing levels of for example: development, access to, production
       and consumption levels and climate. These are some factors that may determine
       which resource (water, food or energy) is the most important for security. For example
       for some Middle Eastern nations with vast oil supplies, water and food security may be
       more of a priority than energy.
      Responses may explain how recent trends in production, consumption, pricing and
       technology may be impacting upon the importance of energy security in relation to
       water and food security. Stronger responses may explain how over time climate
       change is having more of an impact for some regions in terms of their water and food
       security. Responses could explain the differing arguments that relate to population and
       resource consumption using the neo Malthus and anti-Malthus debate.

     Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) which focuses on the recent past and explicitly addresses the issue of
     “most important” using national examples. Responses could evaluate the relative
     importance of energy security in relation to resource security and the possible interactions
     between the two. Another approach might be to evaluate the different time scales over
     which the importance of water, food and energy may vary in importance.

     For 5–6 marks
     Expect weakly-evidenced outlining of energy and/or resource security themes.

     For 7–8 marks
     Expect a well-structured account which includes:
      EITHER a well evidenced synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
       resource security themes from the Guide
      OR a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
       and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks
     Expect both traits.

1.   (a)   Using examples, analyse how technological developments can threaten the security of
           states.                                                                                    [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 2 to 3.

           Credit a broad interpretation of “technological developments” and “security” (thus the
           use of transport to traffic illegal migrants can be credited as a “threat”). Security of
           the state can also be seen as its economic viability: some responses may analyse
           the threats posed by companies’ use of ICT to transfer profits between territories
           and avoid taxes.

           Possible technological themes for analysis include: hacking, cyber-espionage and
           drone missile, attacks in addition to the on-going refinement of more conventional
           weaponry. Possible evidence may include alleged sabotage of US companies by
           Chinese and North Korean agencies, the use of drone missiles by the USA in
           Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or terrorist groups hacking into government
           websites/social media accounts. Answers might also analyse the potential security
           threat posed to state sovereignty by companies who have storage of sensitive
           economic and legal data not in a national location but in cyberspace.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to analyse direct
           attacks on national governments in addition to targeted security threats against
           particular individuals and companies residing within a state (such as on-line fraud
           and identity theft). Details might be provided of what/who the geographical targets
           are, in addition to the technologies that are being deployed (there are threats
           against military and economic targets, for instance). Another approach might be to
           provide a structured analysis of overt/covert or real/virtual security threats.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly-evidenced outlining of one or two relevant
           technological developments.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
            either two relevant and distinct technological developments
            or two relevant and different aspects of state security.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   To what extent does a global culture exist?                                              [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according
      to the markbands on pages 4 to 5. Credit unexpected approaches wherever
      relevant.

      The phrase “global culture” suggests a homogenous culture shared by different
      countries and groups of people living in different places worldwide. This culture
      comprises several shared traits such as language, diet, fashion and music.
      Responses might also consider the extent to which social/political norms – such as
      the valuing of equality and human rights – are universal.

      Not all traits are adopted to the same extent in different places. Global culture does
      not necessarily replace local cultures, especially in hard-to-reach, isolated areas of
      developing countries.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
       some countries’ leading role in cultural globalization (4.1.1)
       the soft power of global superpowers and their cultural influence (4.1.2)
       FDI by TNCs which diffuses cultural traits globally (4.2.2)
       the shrinking world of telecommunications (4.3.2)
       cultural imperialism (5.2.2)
       glocalisation and branded commodities (5.2.2)
       cultural landscape changes (5.2.2)
       the role of diasporas in global culture (5.2.3)
       anti-immigration movements (5.3.1)
       correlation between increased globalization and renewed nationalism/tribalisation
        (6.1.3)
       expect themes from the core units (1–3) to be used also.

      Good answers may synthesise (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a
      well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the extent to
      which a global culture has supplanted / replaced local cultures, or exists alongside
      them (processes of change). Candidates could also evaluate the extent to which all
      citizens within a nation share a global culture equally or whether some groups or
      locations resist change (power and scale), while others embrace it (differing
      perspectives). The extent to which a global culture is truly uniform, or appears in
      various local adapted / hybrid forms in different countries may also be discussed
      (places and interactions). Another approach might be to evaluate the extent to
      which some cultural traits that are shared to a greater degree (eg some spoken
      English, modern architecture, western clothing eg trainers) compared with those that
      are not (eg religions).

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
       or a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   Using examples, analyse how the global shift of different industries affects the
           physical environment.                                                                     [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 2 to 3.

           Possible themes for analysis include:
            the development of global food systems by large agribusinesses. The resulting
             global shift of cereal and meat production into new territories has been linked
             with: pollution (run-off and eutrophication); biodiversity loss from monoculture;
             concerns over GM crops; soil erosion; flooding; albedo changes; possible links
             with global warming and climate change (eg methane emissions from cattle)
            global shift of manufacturing industries. This has had a range of polluting effects
             (including the processing of e-waste and factories in regions with limited
             environmental governance).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured analysis of the impact of different sectors of industry; or to analyse local
           effects, such as flooding, in addition to global concerns such as biodiversity loss, or
           climate change. Candidates might provide more information on global
           agribusinesses and industries (names, locations, markets), rather than offering
           merely a more generic analysis of the harmful impacts of farming on the
           environment. Another approach might be to analyse beneficial effects, such as
           economic benefits that can, in turn, support ecosystem restoration or conservation
           measures. The escalation of negative effects over time might also be analysed:
           companies have responded to technological advancement and the global growth of
           consumerism by building even more complex global production networks with a
           greater footprint size.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly-evidenced outlining of one or two
           environmental effects of the global shift of industry.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
            either two relevant and distinct environmental effects of global shift
            or two relevant and different sectors/types of industry involved in global shift.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   Examine how powerful places maintain their global influence over time.                   [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according
      to the markbands on pages 4 to 5. Credit unexpected approaches wherever
      relevant.

       “Power” is a concept with multiple constituent parts. Expect some discussion of
      economic power/influence (TNCs, trade flows, aid, lending), political power
      (influence over MGOs eg IMF, EU, UN, NATO) and soft power/cultural
      influence/cultural imperialism. Some candidates may additionally examine the role
      of military “hard” power or state control of energy supplies and pathways. Diaspora
      can be examined as another possible means of gaining global influence. “Places”
      may not only refer to states but can also include global hubs / world cities such as
      Tokyo or Paris, or particular regions such as the US “BosWash” region.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
       some countries’ leading role in steering economic and political globalization (and
        in ways which are to their own advantage) (4.1.1)
       global superpowers and their past (colonial) or present-day economic,
        geopolitical and cultural influence over other places (4.1.2)
       some countries’ participation and disproportionate influence over G7/8/20, OECD
        and OPEC groups, or other global institutions (4.1.3)
       the disproportionate influence of some states over IMF and Wold Bank policy
        (4.1.3)
       some countries or cities’ strategic role within global networks and control of
        global flows (4.2.1)
       membership of, and influence over, multi-governmental organizations such as the
        EU (4.3.1)
       the importance of raw material availability (4.3.3)
       cultural imperialism by some states (5.2.2)
       the importance of diaspora for some states’ global influence (5.2.3)
       the use of disruptive technology to maintain power (6.1.2)
       expect themes from the core units (1–3) to be used also.

      Good answers may synthesise (AO3a) three of more of these themes in a
      well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) which examines
      ways in which states or smaller-scale places / world cities maintain influence
      (places, scale and power). They may involve synthesising their ideas in a way
      which highlights how different strategies reinforce each other (interactions). Another
      approach could be to examine what is the most important means of maintaining
      influence (perspectives). Another approach could be to examine change over time,
      also included in the statement, and give some consideration to the strategies which
      may have greatest longevity (possibilities). The concept of “global influence” may
      also be examined; some states eg Nigeria have a powerful regional presence but
      views may diverge on the extent to which Nigeria is a globally influential power
      (perspectives).

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced themes

           to increase their global markets.                                                       [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 2 to 3.

           Possible strategies for explanation include:
            foreign direct investment (either into production eg factories or consumption eg
             stores; and also in the form of joint ventures and mergers)
            the use of glocalised products to maximise share in new markets
            outsourcing (as part of a strategy to maximise profits and reinvest in new
             markets)
            agreements between TNCs and governments (eg in relation to funding of
             infrastructure projects).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured analysis of how some TNCs establish a direct presence in new markets,
           through the establishment of their own branded stores (Carrefour, Apple) while
           others expand through well-advertised exporting (Coca-Cola). Another approach
           might be to analyse the strategies of different industry sectors eg oil companies and
           media companies build global markets in different ways, with the latter making
           greater use of “glocalisation”. Another approach might be to analyse the phrase
           “global market” in more varied ways eg TNCs adopting strategies which appeal to
           different age, ethnic or gender groups in all countries, in order to maximise global
           market share.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly-evidenced outlining of one or two strategies
           used by TNCs.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
            either two relevant strategies used by TNCs
            or two relevant and different categories/sectors of industry.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   “Inequalities within countries are greater than inequalities between countries.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                    [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according
      to the markbands on pages 4 to 5. Credit unexpected approaches wherever
      relevant.

       “Inequalities” can be interpreted as disparities in wealth, or other aspects of
      development, linked with issues of social, political or environmental justice, including
      gender roles in society. All are creditable topics for discussion. Many states have
      seen economic growth in recent years, from low- to middle-income status.
      However, the gap between the highest and lowest ranked states, measured using
      criteria such as GNI per capita, remains very high. Economic inequalities within
      many states are high, though viewpoints differ on whether internal economic
      disparities are accentuated or reduced by national growth (linked with different ways
      in which data are measured, interpreted and used).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
       disparities in the level of globalization shown by different states (4.1.1)
       disparities in the level of state participations on global flows and networks (4.2.1)
       global patterns of profit repatriation to TNCs’ countries of origin (6.1.2)
       international aid as an indicator of economic inequality between states (4.2.1)
       economic migration as an indicator of economic inequality between states (4.2.1)
       disparities in the degree of international power and influence which different
        places possess, giving rise to international but also national-scale core-periphery
        inequality (4.1.2)
       gender and ethnic differences in relation to development and equality at varying
        scales (5.1.2)
       disparities in exposure to pollution at varying scales (6.2.2)
       microfinance networks within nations (5.1.3)
       internet freedoms and disparities at varying scales (5.3.3)
       expect themes from the core units (1–3) to be used also

      Good answers may synthesise (AO3a) three of more of these themes in a
      well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement
      which discusses how its veracity depends on the way in which “inequality” is
      conceptualised (perspectives). Another approach might be to critically discuss and
      compare the levels of internal inequality in different countries (place) perhaps of
      differing sizes (scale). Another approach might be to discuss how the two sets of
      inequalities are possibly linked and interact with one another (interactions), for
      instance TNCs domiciled in high-income countries sometimes work in partnership
      with powerful elites in low-income countries (power). Another approach might be to
      discuss changes that have taken place over time (eg recent increases in the share
      of global wealth that billionaires in many states possess).

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
       or a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.
