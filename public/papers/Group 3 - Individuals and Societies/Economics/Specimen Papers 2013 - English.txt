Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain what might happen to the level of inflation if a government decides to
           move from a budget surplus to a budget deficit.                                  [10 marks]

     (b)   To what extent is an increase in interest rates the most effective cure
           for inflation?                                                                   [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of inflation, interest rates, tight monetary policy, demand-side
        policies
       theory of inflation, monetary policy, alternative economic policies –
        the causes of inflation and the relevance of higher interest rates to each
        of them, alternative cures for inflation
       diagrams to show the different types of inflation, the effects of tight
        monetary policy
       examples of government application of monetary policy to reduce inflation
       synthesis or evaluation (to what extent).

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: the circumstances
      under which interest rate changes will cure inflation, the circumstances under
      which interest rate changes will not cure inflation, the effectiveness of
      alternative policies.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate examples.

1.       Study the extract below and answer the questions that follow.


                                                    Rand at six-month high

          A revival has seen the South African rand reach a near six-month peak against
           the dollar. Foreign buying of shares in South African companies and a surprise contraction in
           South Africa’s current account deficit have helped to boost the currency. So far, in 2009,
           there has been an appreciation of the rand of more than 5 % against the dollar and 9 % against
           the euro, which is the currency of South Africa’s main trading partners, the eurozone countries
           of the European Union (EU). If currency markets take the view that political risk will
           decrease after the general election, there is a “better than even” chance the rand could continue
           to appreciate, said a senior currency dealer.

          Two senior economists said there was a danger the rand would strengthen to a point
           where it would make exports uncompetitive and encourage imports. This could widen the
           current account deficit, which was at 7.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP) last year.
           The currency could strengthen if, for instance, foreign investment increased ahead of the
           2010 soccer World Cup (to be held in South Africa) or the gold price resumed its upward trend
           (gold is a major export for South Africa).

          The rand’s strength would help reduce upward pressure on inflation, which has been
           higher than the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB) (central bank’s) 3 % to 6 % target
           range since March 2007. However, it is bad news for local factories, making local goods
           more expensive in other currencies and, as a result, slowing economic growth. Some analysts
           believe this will prompt the SARB to take steps to weaken the rand, making South African
           exports more competitive.

          A consequence could be that in an attempt to weaken the rand, the SARB governor might
           reduce the bank’s official interest rate too far, sparking a repeat of the consumer boom
           from 2003 to 2006, which left households heavily in debt. Some economists have advised
           the bank to purchase foreign exchange to weaken the currency, rather than lowering interest
           rates further.

                                      Europe accused of protectionism

          The European Union (EU) has been accused of going back on a promise to avoid making
           the global recession worse by imposing new restrictions on free trade. World leaders
           at the G20* meeting in London agreed not to raise new restrictions to free trade in goods
           and services, in order to prevent a protectionist battle like the one which was widely blamed for
           the Great Depression in the 1930s.

          The EU will place a tariff of up to 60 % on the imports of Chinese candles this month.
           Britain’s retailers are furious about the tax on candles, which they say will protect Polish and
           German candle makers, and estimate that it will cost retailers up to UK£10 million. They argue
           that the problems associated with the candle makers’ loss of comparative advantage should
           be solved with other policies.

          The EU has also imposed anti-dumping tariffs, which are meant to protect against cut-price
           subsidized imports, on Chinese wire, iron and steel pipes, and aluminium foil from Brazil,
           China and Armenia.

          Non-tariff restrictions are also a concern. At a recent trade policy review meeting at the
           World Trade Organization (WTO), an Indian trade official criticized the EU for imposing
           new health and safety standards on spices, groundnuts, processed food and cereals,
           creating impossibly high costs for Indian exporters and causing huge commercial losses.
           Also, the EU has several restrictions relating to service industries, such as the restrictions on
           Indian banks starting operations in the EU.




                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)


  A recent survey provided the following results:

             new restrictions                                              44 % (March 2008) – 66 % (March 2009)

           However, the EU trade commissioner stated that “the EU will continue to show leadership and
            stand firm against protectionism,” arguing that it is “committed to free trade based on rules that
            benefit developed and economically less developed countries”. An EU spokesperson insisted
            that the anti-dumping measures actually promote free trade.

                         United Nations secretary-general outlines Laos’ progress

          “Laos has made considerable progress towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals
           (MDGs), but the nation must continue its efforts to reduce child malnutrition and mortality
           rates to make the country more competitive in the global economy,” said United Nations (UN)
           secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.

          “There have been steady improvements in health, education, living standards and life
           expectancy, with progress having been made in literacy rates and access to safe drinking water”,
           Mr Ban said. “These gains are supported by greater macroeconomic stability and increasing
           integration with the global economy,” he added.

          However, Mr Ban warned that much remains to be done if the country is to achieve the MDGs.
           “Poverty is widespread, especially in the countryside,” he said. “Income inequality is getting
           worse.” Mr Ban expressed his particular concern over the high rates of child malnutrition.
           Additionally, the country’s education level is the lowest among the countries belonging to the
           Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “This is not only a human tragedy; it will
           have serious implications for the future of this country’s workforce and its ability to compete
           economically at the international level,” he said.

          Laos intends to develop its economy based on the price mechanism, following the
           example of its neighbours Malaysia and Thailand, but with some state regulation to ensure
           the production of essential services. It will encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) and
           domestic investment, in order to encourage further industrialization. In 2008, the government
           of Laos was successful in stabilizing its macroeconomy and maintaining its 7.9 % economic
           growth rate, while the percentage of households living in absolute poverty was reduced
           to 15.8 %. From 2001 to 2008, Laos attracted US$7.1 billion worth of FDI from 36 countries.

                                            Mining deals with multinationals

          Mineral-rich countries in Africa enjoyed a mining boom between 2002 and 2007 as metal
           and oil prices nearly tripled. Multinational corporations (MNCs) competed furiously for
           new mines to meet growing world demand. As a result, a number of African nations found
           themselves in a much stronger bargaining position with foreign investors, who previously
           were able to demand (and get) huge tax benefits before they would invest. However,
           since then, amidst a global economic recession, world metal and oil prices have fallen
           substantially, raising concerns that investors will once again stay away.

          Copper, which accounts for 80 % of Zambia’s export earnings, is a key component of the
           United States (US) electronics and building industry. It has seen prices fall from US$9000
           to US$3000 per tonne as a result of the economic downturn. “This deterioration in our
           terms of trade is going to affect our economy badly. Mining companies have already started
           cutting down on further investment programmes and they are reducing their workforce,
           which is not good for our economy,” said a Zambian trade official.

          Though richly endowed with mineral and oil deposits, Africa has generally drawn little
           benefit from that wealth. Mining and oil profits have often gone abroad or been wasted,
           leaving many people in poverty. Also, the environment has been damaged by the effects
           of mining, such as pollution. The emergence of more democratic governments, along with
           action by local communities, has led to efforts to make better use of Africa’s natural resources
           for economic development.

          Most mining contracts in Africa were negotiated in the 1980s and 1990s when low world prices
           and high political risks meant that African countries had to attract investors by incentives
           such as tax exemptions. Consequently, many countries earned very little from such contracts.
           African governments are now trying to ensure that mining contracts and regulations address
           environmental protection, provide adequate compensation to affected communities and
           regenerate land after mining operations have ended.

        “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
        includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
        should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

        Responses may include:
         the rand has reached a near six-month peak (paragraph ), which may
          inhibit growth
         the rand has appreciated 9 % against the euro (paragraph ) – thus making
          exports to South Africa’s main trading partners more expensive
         the current account deficit is likely to worsen if the rand continues to
          appreciate
         the current account deficit is already bad (7.4 % of GDP last year
          (paragraph ))
         a policy to weaken the rand might increase inflationary pressure
         local factories (paragraph ) will benefit from such a policy as local
          exports will become more competitive
         buying foreign currency will avoid the need to lower interest rates too much
          (paragraph )
         another consumer boom (paragraph ) may be avoided by purchasing
          foreign currencies

            the upcoming soccer World Cup (paragraph ) will put upward pressure
             on the rand
            if the gold price resumes its upward trend (paragraph ), there will be
             upward pressure on the rand
            some may argue that governments should not intervene in currency markets
            some may argue that the South African government has little power to
             influence the rand – market sentiment may be more powerful.

           For explaining that even though “anti-dumping measures” are barriers to
           trade, they are intended to tackle the protectionist measure of dumping.
           Dumping is the selling of goods in overseas markets at a price which is
           below cost, or significantly below the price in domestic markets –
           possibly as a result of subsidies, and so in themselves are anti-free trade.
           Hence a measure to tackle dumping is actually supporting free trade.

          (paragraph )
         loss of comparative advantage (paragraph )
         the EU has also imposed a range of taxes on other products
         these taxes will protect EU jobs, which may be seen as more important in
          times of recession
         the EU might argue that they are a defence against dumping, so in defence
          of free trade (paragraph )

         it is not only the EU which is imposing barriers (Table 2) – EU barriers
          might be justified in this way – it is not the worst offender

           of the labour force and hence prevent any increase in the productive
           capacity of the economy. This may be illustrated using a PPC diagram.
           Given that economic growth may lead directly to economic development
           via higher incomes, or by providing the finance for the government
           to invest in health, education and infrastructure, growth may lead
           to development. Thus a low level of education is likely to inhibit
           economic development.

Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in calculation,
   but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts, then the
   candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR on the script

      At the old quantity supplied equilibrium price of US$4, with a new demand
      curve, there would now be excess of 25 000 kilos. This means that now, at a
      price of US$4, quantity demanded will be 35 000 kilos and quantity supplied
      will still be 60 000 kilos. The price will have to fall in order to eliminate the
      excess quantity supplied and to reach a new equilibrium.

      At the original price of US$4, with the new demand curve, there will be excess
      quantity supplied. There will be a movement down the existing supply curve
      towards the new equilibrium, but also a movement down the new demand
      curve towards the new equilibrium in order to eliminate the excess quantity
      supplied.

      Thus, quantity supplied will fall by 20 000 kilos as price falls, but quantity
      demanded will increase by 5000 kilos because of the falling price. So, in the
      end, the equilibrium quantity has only fallen by 20 000 kilos, from 60 000 kilos
      to 40 000 kilos.

           A progressive tax system is one where the average rate of tax paid by
           individuals increases as income increases. This means that the marginal rate of
           tax is above the average rate of tax. The figures from the table and from (b)
           will confirm that this type of income tax is progressive.

      Nigeria’s oil revenue may have increased because the demand for oil has
      increased. This means revenue from selling oil would have increased at the
      same time that its price increased. This could be shown by an increase in
      demand for oil on a demand and supply diagram.

      Alternatively, it could have increased because the price elasticity of demand for
      oil is less than one (demand for oil is price inelastic) and so increases in price
      along a given demand curve have led to relatively smaller percentage decreases
      in quantity demanded.

      oil export revenue into index numbers and complete the table on page 8.

      Given that oil is a major source of Nigeria’s export revenues and the index of
      average oil prices has risen it is likely that Nigeria’s terms of trade has
      improved. This is assuming that import prices have increased by less than
      export prices.

      Answers may include:
       definitions of taxes and revenues
       theory of supply and demand relating to indirect taxes. Elasticity,
        pricing decisions and their effect on revenue
       diagrams to show revenue implications for firms and tax revenues
        of government
       examples of where such knowledge would or did provide
        useful information
       synthesis or evaluation (examine).

      Arguments may include: a consideration of the different uses that firms may
      have for elasticity, an evaluation of the use of PED, XED and YED for firms,
      a consideration of the different uses that governments may have for elasticity,
      an evaluation of the use of PED, XED and YED for governments.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate examples.

Answer one question from this section.

1.       Study the extract below and answer the questions that follow.


                                                    Rand at six-month high

          A revival has seen the South African rand reach a near six-month peak against
           the dollar. Foreign buying of shares in South African companies and a surprise contraction in
           South Africa’s current account deficit have helped to boost the currency. So far, in 2009,
           there has been an appreciation of the rand of more than 5 % against the dollar and 9 %
           against the euro, which is the currency of South Africa’s main trading partners, the eurozone
           countries of the European Union (EU). If currency markets take the view that political risk will
           decrease after the general election, there is a “better than even” chance the rand could continue
           to appreciate, said a senior currency dealer.

          Two senior economists said there was a danger the rand would strengthen to a point
           where it would make exports uncompetitive and encourage imports. This could widen the
           current account deficit, which was at 7.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP) last year.
           The currency could strengthen if, for instance, foreign investment increased ahead of the
           2010 soccer World Cup (to be held in South Africa) or the gold price resumed its upward trend
           (gold is a major export for South Africa).

          The rand’s strength would help reduce upward pressure on inflation, which has been
           higher than the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB) (central bank’s) 3 % to 6 % target
           range since March 2007. However, it is bad news for local factories, making local goods
           more expensive in other currencies and, as a result, slowing economic growth. Some analysts
           believe this will prompt the SARB to take steps to weaken the rand, making South African
           exports more competitive.

          A consequence could be that in an attempt to weaken the rand, the SARB governor might
           reduce the bank’s official interest rate too far, sparking a repeat of the consumer boom
           from 2003 to 2006, which left households heavily in debt. Some economists have advised
           the bank to purchase foreign exchange to weaken the currency, rather than lowering interest
           rates further.

                                      Europe accused of protectionism

          The European Union (EU) has been accused of going back on a promise to avoid making
           the global recession worse by imposing new restrictions on free trade. World leaders
           at the G20* meeting in London agreed not to raise new restrictions to free trade in goods
           and services, in order to prevent a protectionist battle like the one which was widely blamed for
           the Great Depression in the 1930s.

          The EU will place a tariff of up to 60 % on the imports of Chinese candles this month. Britain’s
           retailers are furious about the tax on candles, which they say will protect Polish and German
           candle makers, and estimate that it will cost retailers up to UK£10 million.

          The EU has also imposed anti-dumping tariffs, which are meant to protect against cut-price
           subsidized imports, on Chinese wire, iron and steel pipes, and aluminium foil from Brazil,
           China and Armenia.

          Non-tariff restrictions are also a concern. At a recent trade policy review meeting at the
           World Trade Organization (WTO), an Indian trade official criticized the EU for imposing
           new health and safety standards on spices, groundnuts, processed food and cereals,
           creating impossibly high costs for Indian exporters and causing huge commercial losses. Also,
           the EU has several restrictions relating to service industries, such as the restrictions on Indian
           banks starting operations in the EU.

  A recent survey provided the following results:

           However, the EU trade commissioner stated that “the EU will continue to show leadership and
            stand firm against protectionism,” arguing that it is “committed to free trade based on rules that
            benefit developed and economically less developed countries”. An EU spokesperson insisted
            that the anti-dumping measures actually promote free trade.

                         United Nations secretary-general outlines Laos’ progress

          “Laos has made considerable progress towards reaching the Millennium Development Goals
           (MDGs), but the nation must continue its efforts to reduce child malnutrition and mortality
           rates to make the country more competitive in the global economy,” said United Nations (UN)
           secretary-general Ban Ki-moon.

          “There have been steady improvements in health, education, living standards and life
           expectancy, with progress having been made in literacy rates and access to safe drinking water,”
           Mr Ban said. “These gains are supported by greater macroeconomic stability and increasing
           integration with the global economy,” he added.

          However, Mr Ban warned that much remains to be done if the country is to achieve the MDGs.
           “Poverty is widespread, especially in the countryside,” he said. “Income inequality is getting
           worse.” Mr Ban expressed his particular concern over the high rates of child malnutrition.
           Additionally, the country’s education level is the lowest among the countries belonging to the
           Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “This is not only a human tragedy; it will
           have serious implications for the future of this country’s workforce and its ability to compete
           economically at the international level,” he said.

          Laos intends to develop its economy based on the price mechanism, following the example
           of its neighbours Malaysia and Thailand, but with some state regulation to ensure the
           production of essential services. It will encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) and
           domestic investment, in order to encourage further industrialization. In 2008, the government
           of Laos was successful in stabilizing its macroeconomy and maintaining its 7.9 %
           economic growth rate, while the percentage of households living in absolute poverty was
           reduced to 15.8 %. From 2001 to 2008, Laos attracted US$7.1 billion worth of FDI from
           36 countries.

                                            Mining deals with multinationals

          Mineral-rich countries in Africa enjoyed a mining boom between 2002 and 2007 as metal
           and oil prices nearly tripled. Multinational corporations (MNCs) competed furiously for
           new mines to meet growing world demand. As a result, a number of African nations found
           themselves in a much stronger bargaining position with foreign investors, who previously
           were able to demand (and get) huge tax benefits before they would invest. However,
           since then, amidst a global economic recession, world metal and oil prices have fallen
           substantially, raising concerns that investors will once again stay away.

          Copper, which accounts for 80 % of Zambia’s export earnings, is a key component of the
           United States (US) electronics and building industry. It has seen prices fall from US$9000
           to US$3000 per tonne as a result of the economic downturn. “This is going to affect our
           economy badly. Mining companies have already started cutting down on further investment
           programmes and they are reducing their workforce, which is not good for our economy,”
           said a Zambian trade official.

          Though richly endowed with mineral and oil deposits, Africa has generally drawn little
           benefit from that wealth. Mining and oil profits have often gone abroad or been wasted,
           leaving many people in poverty. Also, the environment has been damaged by the effects
           of mining, such as pollution. The emergence of more democratic governments, along with
           action by local communities, has led to efforts to make better use of Africa’s natural resources
           for economic development.

          Most mining contracts in Africa were negotiated in the 1980s and 1990s when low world prices
           and high political risks meant that African countries had to attract investors by incentives
           such as tax exemptions. Consequently, many countries earned very little from such contracts.
           African governments are now trying to ensure that mining contracts and regulations address
           environmental protection, provide adequate compensation to affected communities and
           regenerate land after mining operations have ended.

           may have the effect of destroying domestic industries which may be
           undercut by cheap imports. An “anti-dumping” tariff aims to prevent the

           which is below cost, or significantly below the price in domestic markets
           – possibly as a result of subsidies.

 there is evidence of such a protectionist battle from 2008 to 2009 (Table 1)
 the advantages of trade may be lost
 the price of imported goods and raw materials will increase
 domestic (e.g. British) retailers will be affected – might cost up to an extra
  UK£10 million (paragraph )
 foreign producers may face huge commercial losses (paragraph )
 relations between the world’s trading nations will deteriorate
 there will be less choice for domestic consumers (e.g. banking services)

 global resource allocation will worsen
 the imposition of trade barriers appears to be against the intentions of world
  leaders (paragraph ) – suggesting that they are not a good idea (and/or
  will disadvantage developing countries).

           An explanation that a low level of education will limit the productivity
           of the labour force and hence prevent any increase in the productive
           capacity of the economy. This may be illustrated using a PPC diagram.
           Given that economic growth may lead directly to economic development
           via higher incomes, or by providing the finance for the government
           to invest in health, education and infrastructure, growth may lead
           to development. Thus a low level of education is likely to inhibit
           economic development.

Possible drawbacks of the policies:
 difficulty of raising the necessary funding due to very low income
 opportunity cost of increased funding
 difficulty of ensuring that those in need receive the assistance which is
  funded
 challenge of improving the quality of health and education services
 dangers of increased FDI – pollution (Table), influence on the government,
  employment protection, profits repatriation disadvantages of the price
  mechanism e.g. income inequality.
