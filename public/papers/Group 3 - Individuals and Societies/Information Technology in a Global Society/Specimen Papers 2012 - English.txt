                                                    SECTION A

Answer two questions.

1.   Government websites

     The Australian government website (see Item 1 below) provides news, advice and government
     information for Australian citizens and business travellers.

     It allows citizens to pay tax, update personal details in government databases, claim welfare benefits,
     view previous medical claims and search for jobs. The image below shows part of the home page
     with the navigation bar and hyperlinks.

     It also allows Australian citizens and business travellers to obtain relevant information about other
     countries such as health warnings, entry and visa requirements, and travel advice. Travellers can submit
     a form to register their emergency contact details, and travellers can also visit the website and subscribe
     to RSS feeds.

     (a)   (i)    State two file formats, other than Flash (FLV), that could be used to store
                  the video in Item 2 shown above.                                                                [2 marks]

		         (ii)   The Australian government uses the online tax and welfare databases to
                  provide services to their citizens and to find persons who try to avoid
                  paying taxes. Outline the steps involved in using data matching for
                  these purposes.                                                                                 [4 marks]

     (b)   Governments normally have policies on their website describing how they
           safeguard the privacy of their citizens. Explain three policies that might be
           included and how they protect the privacy of citizens.                                                 [6 marks]

     (c)   The website smartraveller.gov.au enables the Australian government to provide
           tips for business travellers relating to issues such as health warnings, entry and
           visa requirements, and travel advice. Travellers can submit a form to register
           their emergency contact details, and can also visit the website and subscribe to
           RSS feeds. Previously, this information was only available by telephoning the
           government office.  

           Discuss the business travellers’ use of the government                                       website
           (smartraveller.gov.au) to access the information that they require.                                    [8 marks]

2.   Walrus radio-tracking in the southern Chukchi Sea 2008

     During the 2008 migration, researchers attached satellite radio-tags to 28 walruses in the southern
     Chukchi Sea region. Tracking data from this study was intended to help describe walrus movements,
     feeding areas and sea ice habitats within the area of the Chukchi Sea where oil companies were
     planning to drill for oil. Data was also collected to show when the animals were in the water and
     when they were on ice sheets.

     The data from this study was plotted onto an animated map to show the daily locations of
     tagged walruses. It also showed the distribution of sea ice based on real-time imagery.

     Other information can also be collected by the walrus tags, such as sea temperatures, salt levels of the
     ocean and concentrations of chemicals associated with the oil industry. This information can be used
     to create models to predict future environmental changes, such as sea ice levels and pollution.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Define the term real-time.                                                   [2 marks]

		         (ii)   Outline four steps involved in converting the data collected from the
                  walrus tag to the animated map in the image on the opposite page.            [4 marks]

     (b)   (i)    Explain one advantage of using visualization to display the data collected
                  on the walrus tags.                                                          [2 marks]

		         (ii)   Before walruses were tagged electronically, researchers had to directly
                  observe and manually record their movements.

			               Compare the data collected from walrus tags electronically with that
                  obtained manually.                                                           [4 marks]

     (c)   To what extent can information collected from the walrus tags in the Chukchi Sea
           assist environmental agencies in making decisions about the future development
           of the area?                                                                        [8 marks]

3.   Online Amateur News Reporting

     In January 2009 a plane crashed in the Hudson river, New York City. A citizen, Janis Krums,
     took the first photo of the plane using a cell/mobile phone while on a ferry.  He immediately uploaded
     the photo to his micro-blogging account.

     The interest in the photo and the vast number of people trying to access the photo at the same time
     caused the micro-blogging service to be down at times. Nearly 40 000 web users viewed the photo
     in the first four hours after the posting, and thousands of users filled more than 100 screens with
     replies to Krums’ micro-blogging account. Thousands more – including mainstream news websites –
     created links to the image.

     This is an example of an online citizen reporting a news story as it happens and making it
     instantly accessible. This is a trend that has steadily increased as people use online services to post
     text and photos from their cell/mobile phones.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)    In an emergency situation, such as the Hudson river crash,
                  the cell/mobile phone user must be able to post a photo immediately.

                  Identify two preconditions that were necessary to enable Janis Krums to
                  make this instantaneous posting.                                             [2 marks]

		         (ii)   Describe two methods that a photo hosting website, such as Flickr, can use
                  to restrict access to users’ photos.                                         [4 marks]

     (b)   A high school has agreed to students posting photos of field trips and other
           school activities on the school website. However, this requires students to sign
           a contributor’s agreement.

           Explain three statements that would be contained in a contributor’s agreement
           for the school website.                                                             [6 marks]

     (c)   The increasing trend for individuals to post information and photos about current
           events as they are occurring is welcomed by some people and causes considerable
           concern for others.

           Discuss the decision of a national newspaper to use images from citizens such as
           Janis Krums rather than using professional photographers.                           [8 marks]

Answer one question.

4.   IT Systems in Moldazia state

     The government of Moldazia state wishes to develop a new government information system which
     will organize all its stored data in a central location. Part of this new system will enable citizens to
     gain access to appropriate information using a web browser.

     Using this system, citizens will be able to download publications, forms and information about the
     state’s services as well as to provide feedback.

     Currently, the information is stored in a wide variety of formats held on a number of servers.
     This means that inquirers have to contact a member of staff by phone or email and request the
     information to be sent.

     The newly elected governor has told the chief IT project manager that a fully functional,
     integrated and interactive IT system allowing citizens access to appropriate information must be
     implemented by 1 June 2011.

     In order to speed up the process, the programmer has been allowed to start work on some of the
     modules in advance of project approval.

     The work breakdown structure for the development of the Moldazia IT system is as follows:

      Project stage                    Start date           End date              Development

Answer one question.

6.   CAPTCHA

     The following text in the image below has been generated by a CAPTCHA program.




                                     [Source: http://recaptcha.net/captcha.html]


     The CAPTCHA is used to control access to an online medical expert system which contains
     sensitive information. This system was installed at a cost of 25 million euros. It provides patients with
     an opportunity to self-diagnose their illnesses.


     (a)   (i)    Identify two ways that a CAPTCHA can be used to distinguish between
                  human and machine.                                                                  [2 marks]

		         (iii) Describe one difference between a CAPTCHA and the Turing test.                       [2 marks]

     (b)   Explain two reasons why the development of an expert system for self-diagnosis
           may bring benefits to patients and medical staff.                                          [6 marks]

     (c)   To what extent does the development of tests such as CAPTCHAs help to
           advance the development of artificial intelligence?                                        [8 marks]

7.   Robotics

     Most robots do not resemble the way they are depicted in science fiction books, films and
     on television, but are useful special purpose IT systems. They are increasingly used both in the
     home and industry.   For example, a robotic lawn mower can be set to mow the lawn at
     intervals programmed by the owner, returning to a docking station to recharge as necessary.
     Robotic paint sprayers have been used to paint cars for over 20 years.

     Another area where robots are being developed is in warfare.

     The cruise missile is a weapon that can travel thousands of kilometres in order to hit a
     pre-determined target. It is accurate enough to be aimed at a single building. Cruise missiles are able
     to fly low, following the terrain, so that they avoid detection by enemy radar.  It is also possible to
     select a new target by providing the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates after the missile has
     been launched.

     Future developments could include the missile being able to decide on its approach whether the target
     is friend or enemy, preventing the possibility of the cruise missile striking friendly forces. One day,
     robotic weapons could be given a degree of autonomy where they could make their own decisions
     about whether to kill or not. Some people think that there should always be a human involved in this
     decision making process but others think that such decisions should be based on logic rather than
     human judgment.

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

(b)   Governments normally have policies on their website describing how they
      safeguard the privacy of their citizens. Explain three policies that might be
      included and how they protect the privacy of citizens.                        [6 marks]

      Answers may include the following policies and reasons:
      • process is audited externally – to reassure that process of data collection is
        carried out properly/fairly
      • data collection is done legally – to assure that no improper intrusion is used
      • only used for intended purpose – to avoid problems that emerge (i.e. data
        matching, unsolicited advertising)
      • disclosure: only seen by authorized persons – to avoid the leakage of personal
        information
      • data quality: data held is accurate – to prevent problems that may result from
        the use of inaccurate data
      • data security: data is looked after properly (i.e. not sent on CD-ROMs by post)
        – to prevent personal information being accessed by unauthorized persons
      • openness: no secret data collected – to prevent data being used for purposes
        unknown to individuals
      • access and correction: persons can check that their personal information is
        correct – to allow the person to see the information held about them and avoid
        problems that emerge from incorrect information being used
      • identifiers: persons cannot be identified from any statistical publications –
        to avoid the exposure of personal information and subsequent results
      • trans-border data flows: data not exported to untrustworthy countries – to avoid
        unauthorized access to personal information by corrupt persons (i.e. sharing of
        personal banking details).

      Award [1 mark] for each type of appropriate policy identified, and [1 mark] for
      each appropriate explanation of how that policy will protect the privacy of its
      citizens up to a maximum of [2 marks] for each policy. Award a maximum of
      [6 marks] for the answer.

(c)   The website smartraveller.gov.au enables the Australian government to
      provide tips for business travellers relating to issues such as health warnings,
      entry and visa requirements, and travel advice. Travellers can submit a form
      to register their emergency contact details, and can also visit the website and
      subscribe to RSS feeds. Previously, this information was only available by
      telephoning the government office.

      Discuss the business travellers’ use of the government                     website
      (smartraveller.gov.au) to access the information that they require.                   [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • can always be up to date

      future development of the area?                                         [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • they now know where the animals go
      • can limit exploitation to areas that will not affect the animals
      • can take seasonality into account
      • exploit area when animals are away
      • can incorporate the data collected from the tags into other models or
        simulations such as those that measure the extent of the sea ice or the
        temperature of the Arctic Ocean
      • may lead to sharing of information.

      Disadvantages
      • data may be insufficient in volume or cover a restricted area to be meaningful
        to other models
      • models generated from this inaccurate data may give an inaccurate picture of
        the changes to the Arctic Ocean to strategic planners
      • maybe disturbances have indirect effects
      • possibly affect food supply
      • other species not investigated

      current events as they are occurring is welcomed by some people and causes
      considerable concern for others.

      Discuss the decision of a national newspaper to use images from citizens such
      as Janis Krums rather than using professional photographers.                  [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive effects
      • amateurs are sometimes paid, albeit less than professional photographic
        agencies, for their photo submissions
      • amateurs may collect valuable information that would be useful in court cases
        (i.e. accident scene) increasing the credibility of the newspaper
      • photos from citizens will arrive quicker to the newspaper from the time that the
        event happened than those obtained from professional photographic agencies
      • the newspaper may be able to sell these images to other organizations
      • money saved in not paying professional photographic agencies may be spent
        on other services (i.e. maintaining the photo library, purchasing extra
        IT capacity).

      Negative effects
      • in instances of disaster, family members of persons involved in disasters could
        be psychologically affected by the photos appearing in the newspaper before
        they have been informed
      • individuals in photos taken by amateurs have not given their permission for the
        photo to be used
      • the issue of ownership may be a complex one and require considerable cost to
        develop a contributor’s agreement
      • the quality of the images will not be as good as those obtained from
        professional photographic agencies
      • the website of the newspaper may not be able to cope with the volume of
        images submitted by citizens and crash at key periods.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to

Answer three questions.

1.   The MP3 player

     The MP3 player is a result of the convergence of many technologies and has grown in popularity
     in recent years. Individually, none of its components are revolutionary, but together they create an
     innovative product.




                   [Source: http://portableplayers.blogspot.com/2008/01/sym-164-flash-mp3-player.html]


     On an audio CD, a typical song of 4 minutes takes up about 40 megabytes (MB) of storage.
     An equivalent MP3 format file of the same song is compressed to about 4 MB. MP3 players,
     like most modern electronic devices, are under the control of an embedded system.



                                                                   (This question continues on the following page)
                                                   –3–                 SPEC/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Outline the steps that the MP3 player must take in order to play a song.    [4 marks]

		         (ii)   A student wishes to download a 4 minute song (MP3 file) to her
                  MP3 player. The speed of her internet connection is 12 megabits per
                  second (Mbps). Calculate how long it will take the student to download
                  this song. (Show all your working)                                          [2 marks]

     (b)   Embedded systems, such as those used in MP3 players, are commonly
           found in many consumer products such as refrigerators, washing machines,
           dishwashers and cars. Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of the use of
           embedded systems in appliances.                                                    [6 marks]

     (c)   A school is investigating an m-learning programme that allows students to
           access their lesson resources remotely using mobile devices. Discuss whether
           the learning of students will be improved by the use of podcasts, MP3s and other
           mobile technologies.                                                               [8 marks]

2.   Distributed computing

     Peer-to-peer networking (P2P) is a means of connecting computers where all participating computers
     are equal. P2P can be achieved over internet connections, where individual computers can contact
     each other without the need to enter into a client-server relationship. They often operate outside the
     domain name system (DNS) and thus have considerable autonomy from servers.

     One way in which P2P can be implemented is for a user to run client software which is given the
     IP address of one or more participating computers:
     • the software contacts the participating computers directly
     • a request for a file is sent to that computer
     • if the file is on that computer, the file is sent back to the computer replacing the request
     • otherwise, the request is passed on to other participating computers
     • each participating computer stores the IP addresses of some other participating computers
     • the request can be passed on repeatedly
     • the request has a “time-to-live” (TTL) or pre-determined length of time that the requests can be
        passed on, so that the process does not go on forever.


     (a)   (i)    Define the term IP address.                                                   [2 marks]

		         (ii)   Describe the relationship between the server and a client in a network.       [2 marks]

		         (iii) Identify two steps a DNS server takes to help a user locate a particular
                 web page.                                                                      [2 marks]

     (b)   (i)    Explain one reason why a user may use more than one web browser.              [2 marks]

		         (ii)   Explain two reasons why the illegal copying of music on a P2P network is
                  more difficult to prosecute than that on client-server networks.              [4 marks]

     (c)   A company is based at various geographical locations. The senior managing
           team is considering the use of web-based P2P networking in order to make
           business-related files available to its staff. To what extent would this be an
           effective way to share its business data?                                            [8 marks]

3.   Government websites

     The Australian government website (see Item 1 below) provides news, advice and government
     information for Australian citizens and business travellers.

     It allows citizens to pay tax, update personal details in government databases, claim welfare benefits,
     view previous medical claims and search for jobs. The image below shows part of the home page
     with the navigation bar and hyperlinks.

     It also allows Australian citizens and business travellers to obtain relevant information about other
     countries such as health warnings, entry and visa requirements, and travel advice. Travellers can submit
     a form to register their emergency contact details, and travellers can also visit the website and subscribe
     to RSS feeds.

		         (ii)   The Australian government uses the online tax and welfare databases to
                  provide services to their citizens and to find persons who try to avoid
                  paying taxes. Outline the steps involved in using data matching for
                  these purposes.                                                                                 [4 marks]

     (b)   Governments normally have policies on their website describing how they
           safeguard the privacy of their citizens. Explain three policies that might be
           included and how they protect the privacy of citizens.                                                 [6 marks]

     (c)   The website smartraveller.gov.au enables the Australian government to provide
           tips for business travellers relating to issues such as health warnings, entry and
           visa requirements, and travel advice. Travellers can submit a form to register
           their emergency contact details, and can also visit the website and subscribe to
           RSS feeds. Previously, this information was only available by telephoning the
           government office.

           Discuss the business travellers’ use of the government                                       website
           (smartraveller.gov.au) to access the information that they require.                                    [8 marks]

4.   Walrus radio-tracking in the southern Chukchi Sea 2008

     During the 2008 migration, researchers attached satellite radio-tags to 28 walruses in the southern
     Chukchi Sea region. Tracking data from this study was intended to help describe walrus movements,
     feeding areas and sea ice habitats within the area of the Chukchi Sea where oil companies were
     planning to drill for oil. Data was also collected to show when the animals were in the water and
     when they were on ice sheets.

     The data from this study was plotted onto an animated map to show the daily locations of
     tagged walruses. It also showed the distribution of sea ice based on real-time imagery.

     Other information can also be collected by the walrus tags, such as sea temperatures, salt levels of the
     ocean and concentrations of chemicals associated with the oil industry. This information can be used
     to create models to predict future environmental changes, such as sea ice levels and pollution.

		         (ii)   Outline four steps involved in converting the data collected from the
                  walrus tag to the animated map in the image on the opposite page.            [4 marks]

     (b)   (i)    Explain one advantage of using visualization to display the data collected
                  on the walrus tags.                                                          [2 marks]

		         (ii)   Before walruses were tagged electronically, researchers had to directly
                  observe and manually record their movements.

			               Compare the data collected from walrus tags electronically with that
                  obtained manually.                                                           [4 marks]

5.   Online Amateur News Reporting

     In January 2009 a plane crashed in the Hudson river, New York City. A citizen, Janis Krums,
     took the first photo of the plane using a cell/mobile phone while on a ferry. He immediately uploaded
     the photo to his micro-blogging account.

     The interest in the photo and the vast number of people trying to access the photo at the same time
     caused the micro-blogging service to be down at times. Nearly 40 000 web users viewed the photo
     in the first four hours after the posting, and thousands of users filled more than 100 screens with
     replies to Krums’ micro-blogging account. Thousands more – including mainstream news websites –
     created links to the image.

     This is an example of an online citizen reporting a news story as it happens and making it
     instantly accessible. This is a trend that has steadily increased as people use online services to post
     text and photos from their cell/mobile phones.

(Question 5 continued)

     (a)   (i)    In an emergency situation, such as the Hudson river crash,
                  the cell/mobile phone user must be able to post a photo immediately.

                  Identify two preconditions that were necessary to enable Janis Krums to
                  make this instantaneous posting.                                             [2 marks]

		         (ii)   Describe two methods that a photo hosting website, such as Flickr, can use
                  to restrict access to users’ photos.                                         [4 marks]

     (b)   A high school has agreed to students posting photos of field trips and other
           school activities on the school website. However, this requires students to sign
           a contributor’s agreement.

           Explain three statements that would be contained in a contributor’s agreement
           for the school website.                                                             [6 marks]

     (c)   The increasing trend for individuals to post information and photos about current
           events as they are occurring is welcomed by some people and causes considerable
           concern for others.

           Discuss the decision of a national newspaper to use images from citizens such as
           Janis Krums rather than using professional photographers.                           [8 marks]

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

1.   (a)   (i)    Outline the steps that the MP3 player must take in order to play
                  a song.                                                          [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • loads/retrieves the song from storage
                  • decompresses the MP3 encoding
                  • converts the digital information to analogue (sound waves)
                  • amplifies the analogue signal, allowing the song to be heard.

                  Award [1 mark] for each correct step identified in sequence up to a
                  maximum of [4 marks].

           (ii)   A student wishes to download a 4 minute song (MP3 file) to her
                  MP3 player. The speed of her internet connection is 12 megabits per
                  second (Mbps). Calculate how long it will take the student to download
                  this song. (Show all your working)                                     [2 marks]

                   4MB = 4×8Mbit = 32Mbit
                   Speed = 32÷12 = 2 ⅔ seconds (or 2.66 seconds).

                  N.B. Accept an answer that has been rounded up to 3 seconds.

                  Award [1 mark] for:
                   a correct answer with no evidence how the answer was arrived at
                   correct workings but the answer is incorrect due to an arithmetic error.
                  Award [2 marks] for both a correct answer and correct workings.

(b)   Embedded systems, such as those used in MP3 players, are commonly found
      in many consumer products such as refrigerators, washing machines,
      dishwashers and cars. Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of the use
      of embedded systems in appliances.                                        [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • increased functionality
      • can be repaired easily / replace module when faulty
      • more inventive products produced
      • easier to use products
      • more efficient products / work at optimum level instead of expecting consumer
        to set parameters
      • products capable of making decisions.

      Disadvantages
      • wastage – throw away whole module if faulty instead of repair component part
      • may make decisions that user does not want (e.g. camera setting optimized
        instead of specially selected).

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of the
      topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4 marks]
      A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples are used within
      the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the response.

      [5–6 marks]
      A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates thorough knowledge
      and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples are used throughout the response.
      There is appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the response.
                                            –5–              SPEC/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   A school is investigating an m-learning programme that allows students to
      access their lesson resources remotely using mobile devices. Discuss whether
      the learning of students will be improved by the use of podcasts, MP3s and
      other mobile technologies.                                                   [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • wide variety of sources for a greater learning experience
      • availability of podcasts/vidcasts from experts
      • students can learn when they feel like it rather than set times
      • a variety of teaching techniques may accommodate varied learning styles.

      Disadvantages
      • students will not want to have school intruding into their personal time
      • students will not want to clutter up their MP3 players with school work
      • students may not perceive mobile technologies for learning devices (i.e. MP3
        player is for fun, not school work)
      • learning with mobile technologies requires a reliable connection to the internet
        and this may not be available
      • no reason to think that using novel methods will be an incentive
      • students may prefer to have a real teacher to explain things / interactivity /
        personalized.

      In part (c) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on the
      terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT technical
      terminology.

2.   (a)   (i)    Define the term IP address.                                                    [2 marks]

                  A unique number that identifies a resource on a network [1 mark],
                  plus any one of the additional points below [2 marks].

                  •   consists of 4 octets
                  •   each of 8 bits / 1 byte
                  •   each contains a number from 0–255
                  •   octets are separated by dots
                  •   would be written as 36.134.200.5 for example.

           (ii)   Describe the relationship between the server and a client in a network.        [2 marks]

                      Client-server identifies the relationship between two different network
                      components/computers, i.e. the client program on the computer requests
                      services, and the server program provides those services.

                  Award [1 mark] for a statement that correctly identifies both of the network
                  components i.e. client machine and server machine, and award [1 mark] for
                  correctly identifying the relationship between the two different network
                  components/computers. For example, the client requests services and the
                  server provides them. Award a maximum of [2 marks] for the response.

           (iii) Identify two steps a DNS server takes to help a user locate a particular
                 web page.                                                                [2 marks]

                  Answers may include the following steps:
                  • DNS server stores IP addresses and equivalent domain names
                  • user enters (easy to remember) domain name in their browser
                  • DNS server looks up IP address
                  • DNS server substitutes IP address for the domain name.

                  Award [1 mark] for each correct step identified up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].

(b)   (i)    Explain one reason why a user may use more than one web browser.                  [2 marks]

             Answers may include the following reasons:
             • web browsers differ in facilities offered
             • users need to access company websites using the recommended web
               browser
             • some web browsers have better security
             • some web browsers have useful/different add-ons
             • some web browsers are open source and can be modified.

             Award [1 mark] for each type of appropriate reason identified, and
             [1 mark] for the explanation of that reason up to a maximum of
             [2 marks].

      (ii)   Explain two reasons why the illegal copying of music on a P2P network
             is more difficult to prosecute than that on client-server networks.   [4 marks]

             Answers may include the following reasons:
             • no single location for the illegal files, therefore cannot identify single IP
               address
             • source may be different each time user accesses resource so difficult to
               know who to pursue
             • users may be online only for a short time so it cannot be determined if
               they are guilty
             • more legitimate traffic on users’ computers so more difficult to identify
               illicit material.

             Award [1 mark] for each appropriate reason identified up to a maximum
             of [2 marks], and [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation of each
             reason up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award a maximum of [4 marks] for
             the answer.

(c)   A company is based at various geographical locations. The senior managing
      team is considering the use of web-based P2P networking in order to make
      business-related files available to its staff. To what extent would this be an
      effective way to share its business data?                                      [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • In a pure P2P architecture there is no single point of failure; that means, if one
        peer breaks down, the rest of the peers are still able to communicate.
      • P2P provides the opportunity to take advantage of unused resources such as
        processing power for computations and storage capacity. In client-server
        architectures, the centralized system bears the majority of the cost of
        the system. In P2P, all peers help spread the cost.
      • P2P can prevent bottlenecks such as traffic overload using a central
        server architecture, because P2P can distribute data and balance request across
        the net without using a central server.
      • There is better scalability due to a lack of centralized control and because most
        peers interact with each other.

      Disadvantages
      • Today, many applications need a high security standard, which is not satisfied
        by current P2P solutions.
      • The connections between the peers are normally not designed for high
        throughput rates, even if the coverage of ADSL and cable modem connections
        is increasing.
      • A centralized system or a client-server system will work as long as the service
        provider keeps it up and running. If peers start to abandon a P2P system,
        services will not be available to anyone.
      • Most search engines work best when they can search a central database rather
        than launch a meta search of peers.
      • Most networks using client-server architecture will have a network manager
        assigned to the maintenance of the network. A P2P network may be managed
        on an ad-hoc basis.
      • Many business-related files need to be updated by a variety of employees.
        If copies of files are allowed to proliferate with a loss of control over updating,
        then serious problems will ensue.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                  [2 marks].

           (ii)   The Australian government uses the online tax and welfare databases to
                  provide services to their citizens and to find persons who try to avoid
                  paying taxes. Outline the steps involved in using data matching for
                  these purposes.                                                         [4 marks]

                  Answers may include the following steps:
                  • open tax database
                  • open welfare database
                  • look at one individual’s record from one database
                  • search other database for match
                  • look for inconsistencies between records
                  • if there are inconsistencies, then carry out an investigation
                  • repeat for other records.

                  Award [1 mark] for each correct step identified in sequence, up to a
                  maximum of [4 marks].

(b)   Governments normally have policies on their website describing how they
      safeguard the privacy of their citizens. Explain three policies that might be
      included and how they protect the privacy of citizens.                        [6 marks]

      Answers may include the following policies and reasons:
      • process is audited externally – to reassure that process of data collection is
        carried out properly/fairly
      • data collection is done legally – to assure that no improper intrusion is used
      • only used for intended purpose – to avoid problems that emerge (i.e. data
        matching, unsolicited advertising)
      • disclosure: only seen by authorized persons – to avoid the leakage of personal
        information
      • data quality: data held is accurate – to prevent problems that may result from
        the use of inaccurate data
      • data security: data is looked after properly (i.e. not sent on CD-ROMs by post)
        – to prevent personal information being accessed by unauthorized persons
      • openness: no secret data collected – to prevent data being used for purposes
        unknown to individuals
      • access and correction: persons can check that their personal information is
        correct – to allow the person to see the information held about them and avoid
        problems that emerge from incorrect information being used
      • identifiers: persons cannot be identified from any statistical publications –
        to avoid the exposure of personal information and subsequent results
      • trans-border data flows: data not exported to untrustworthy countries – to avoid
        unauthorized access to personal information by corrupt persons (i.e. sharing of
        personal banking details).

      Award [1 mark] for each type of appropriate policy identified, and [1 mark] for
      each appropriate explanation of how that policy will protect the privacy of its
      citizens up to a maximum of [2 marks] for each policy. Award a maximum of
      [6 marks] for the answer.

(c)   The website smartraveller.gov.au enables the Australian government to
      provide tips for business travellers relating to issues such as health warnings,
      entry and visa requirements, and travel advice. Travellers can submit a form
      to register their emergency contact details, and can also visit the website and
      subscribe to RSS feeds. Previously, this information was only available by
      telephoning the government office.

      Discuss the business travellers’ use of the government                     website
      (smartraveller.gov.au) to access the information that they require.                   [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • can always be up to date
      • immediate access to the information on the website (i.e. no waiting to get
        through on the telephone, no problem locating right person)
      • can print the information
      • can select what is needed
      • information on a government website is reliable.

      Disadvantages
      • need appropriate computing technologies with internet access
      • might take a while to find what you want, website may not be intuitive
      • the website may not provide all of the information required (i.e. might be better
        to talk to someone who can advise you if you have a particular requirement).

                  • until no more tags.

                  Award [1 mark] for each step outlined in the correct sequence up to a
                  maximum of [4 marks].

     (b)   (i)    Explain one advantage of using visualization to display the data
                  collected on the walrus tags.                                    [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • information easy to understand/interpret
                  • humans respond better to visual data/find lots of figures counter-intuitive.

                  Award [1 mark] for identifying an advantage of using visualization and
                  [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation of how it is used to effectively
                  display the data collected up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(ii)   Before walruses were tagged electronically, researchers had to directly
       observe and manually record their movements.

       Compare the data collected from walrus tags electronically with that
       obtained manually.                                                   [4 marks]

       Answers may include:
       • more accurate
       • no human error
       • data collected 24/7
       • previously only collected when researchers were at work
       • more walruses observed
       • previously limited to those walruses that were being observed by humans.

       [1–2 marks]
       Candidate conveys some understanding of the difference between the quality
       of the data, but the two ways would have been described in isolation.

       [3–4 marks]
       The candidate provides an explicit and direct comparison of the two
       techniques used for data collection with the use of appropriate terminology.

(c)   To what extent can information collected from the walrus tags in the
      Chukchi Sea assist environmental agencies in making decisions about the
      future development of the area?                                         [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
      • they now know where the animals go
      • can limit exploitation to areas that will not affect the animals
      • can take seasonality into account
      • exploit area when animals are away
      • can incorporate the data collected from the tags into other models or
        simulations such as those that measure the extent of the sea ice or the
        temperature of the Arctic Ocean
      • may lead to sharing of information.

      Disadvantages
      • data may be insufficient in volume or cover a restricted area to be meaningful
        to other models
      • models generated from this inaccurate data may give an inaccurate picture of
        the changes to the Arctic Ocean to strategic planners
      • maybe disturbances have indirect effects
      • possibly affect food supply
      • other species not investigated
      • may be used by other organizations such as fishing fleets that leads to the
        disruption of the food chain by overfishing.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between the IT technical terminology and the terminology related
      to social and ethical impacts.

5.   (a)   (i)    In an emergency situation, such as the Hudson river crash,
                  the cell/mobile phone user must be able to post a photo immediately.

                  Identify two preconditions that were necessary to enable Janis Krums
                  to make this instantaneous posting.                                  [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • set up the micro-blogging account to accept photos being sent from the
                    cell/mobile phone
                  • set up the cell/mobile phone to send all photos directly to the specific
                    micro-blogging account.

                  Award [1 mark] for each precondition identified up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].

           (ii)   Describe two methods that a photo hosting website, such as Flickr,
                  can use to restrict access to users’ photos.                       [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • viewers must have a Flickr account with a password or be invited –
                    allows some vetting / identification of users
                  • the user sets the privileges on the photo hosting website – this determines
                    who can view the pictures.

                  Award [1 mark] for each method identified up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks] and award [1 mark] for the description of each method up to a
                  maximum of [2 marks]. Award a maximum of [4 marks] for the answer.

(b)   A high school has agreed to students posting photos of field trips and other
      school activities on the school website. However, this requires students to
      sign a contributor’s agreement.

      Explain three statements that would be contained in a contributor’s
      agreement for the school website.                                   [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       • the school agreement will have control over the content of the image such as
         not including inappropriate/adult/potentially embarrassing content
       • the school agreement will require the written consent of the parent/guardian if
         a photo contains the image of their child
       • the school agreement may specify the length of time the image may be kept
         posted on the website
       • the school agreement indicates that it has the right to remove the image
         without consulting the contributor.

      Award [1 mark] for each statement identified and [1 mark] for each appropriate
      explanation of that statement up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award a maximum
      of [6 marks] for the answer.

(c)   The increasing trend for individuals to post information and photos about
      current events as they are occurring is welcomed by some people and causes
      considerable concern for others.

      Discuss the decision of a national newspaper to use images from citizens such
      as Janis Krums rather than using professional photographers.                  [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive effects
      • amateurs are sometimes paid, albeit less than professional photographic
        agencies, for their photo submissions
      • amateurs may collect valuable information that would be useful in court cases
        (i.e. accident scene) increasing the credibility of the newspaper
      • photos from citizens will arrive quicker to the newspaper from the time that the
        event happened than those obtained from professional photographic agencies
      • the newspaper may be able to sell these images to other organizations
      • money saved in not paying professional photographic agencies may be spent
        on other services (i.e. maintaining the photo library, purchasing extra
        IT capacity).

      Negative effects
      • in instances of disaster, family members of persons involved in disasters could
        be psychologically affected by the photos appearing in the newspaper before
        they have been informed
      • individuals in photos taken by amateurs have not given their permission for the
        photo to be used
      • the issue of ownership may be a complex one and require considerable cost to
        develop a contributor’s agreement
      • the quality of the images will not be as good as those obtained from
        professional photographic agencies
      • the website of the newspaper may not be able to cope with the volume of
        images submitted by citizens and crash at key periods.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                                                                  Topic: Health

     Patients who have diabetes (diabetics) must measure their blood sugar (blood glucose) a number of
     times a day to ensure that it stays within safe levels. If their blood glucose level is too high, they may
     become unconscious and fall into a coma. Diabetics are expected to record their results daily so that
     they can monitor their own blood glucose levels. These results are accessible to patients and also
 5   reviewed by their doctors at the local hospital on a monthly basis.

     Diabetics have been involved in tests with new IT technologies that experts hope will lead to an
     increase in the use of online health records.

     Previously a diabetic would be required to record blood glucose levels in a notebook. Now a blood
     glucose meter can be used to measure levels of blood glucose and this information can be uploaded
10   to a computer.

     This development has taken place in partnership with the company LivingWithDiabetes which has
     developed a website that makes it possible for patients to upload their blood glucose levels so that
     medical staff can view this information as shown in the chart below.


                                                        Blood glucose levels for patient X
                                                  350

     The process works as follows:

15         1.       Blood is taken and glucose levels are measured by the meter.
           2.       The results are uploaded and stored on the patient’s computer.
           3.       Results are sent to the LivingWithDiabetes website.
           4.       Results are viewed by medical staff.
                                                   –3–               SPEC/3/ITGSX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/T

     Doctors believe that this new online blood glucose recording system will be significantly better
20   than the previous manual system because patients play a key role in managing their own condition.
     Previously doctors relied on patients providing information about their blood glucose levels to
     the medical staff and the information would then be passed on to the doctors. Now doctors can
     immediately access this information online.

     This online blood glucose recording system would only require one nurse to manage
25   200 diabetic patients. It would allow nurses to spend more time with patients when they are first
     diagnosed, teaching them how to manage their condition.

     Doctors believe this is an ideal solution for themselves, other medical staff and diabetic patients.

Using assessment criteria for external assessment
For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate range
of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure
to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

  The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

  The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
  the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
  when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
  should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
  necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

  When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
  they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
  piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one
  that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

  Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
  if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should award
  the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

  Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
  acceptable.

  Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
  the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

  The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
  a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of
  the work being assessed.

  A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
  attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
  low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
  other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will produce
  any particular distribution of marks.

  The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

Describe one social/ethical concern related to the IT system.

Social/ethical concerns may include the following:
  privacy/security of patient information, for example, sensitive patient information stored
  on the website may be viewed by hackers
  reliability of the transfer of data, for example, patient data could be lost during
  transmission from the patient’s computer to the website
  reliability of the website where data is uploaded, for example, the web server could be
  unavailable preventing the upload of patient data.


Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system.

Primary stakeholders may include the following:
   diabetic patients, whose results are uploaded/stored
   medical staff: doctors and nurses who use this IT system for the care of diabetic patients.

     Marks                                          Level descriptor

        0          The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

Criterion B — The IT concepts and processes                                                  [6 marks]

Describe, step by step, how the IT system works.

Answers provided in the article include the following:
  meter reads patient’s blood glucose level
  results are stored on the patient’s computer
  results are sent to LivingWithDiabetes website
  records are accessed by doctors and medical staff
  patients can access their own results.

Answers with additional information to that in the article may include the following:
  meter reads patient’s blood glucose level and this is uploaded to the patient’s computer
  using a cable via serial/USB port
  time of upload is recorded by the computer’s internal clock
  data is stored on the patient’s computer hard disk
  patient loads the LivingWithDiabetes website using an internet browser
  patient logs into LivingWithDiabetes website using a previously given login and secret
  password
  special file transfer software is provided by LivingWithDiabetes to allow the patient to
  upload results
  results are stored in a database on the LivingWithDiabetes website
  relevant health practitioners/medical staff are given a login and password to access the
  results on the LivingWithDiabetes website
  results are analysed/manipulated to see changes in patient’s condition.
                                                   –5–             SPEC/3/ITGSX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern described in
Criterion A.

Answers may include the following:
Privacy may be an issue if data is not properly secured, for example:
   if data is intercepted by hackers during transfer of results from the patient’s computer to
   the LivingWithDiabetes website
   if passwords are not used on the LivingWithDiabetes server and unauthorized access
   is possible.

Reliability would be a concern if:
  there is a malfunction of the meter when reading the blood glucose level
  there is an error during transmission resulting in incorrect data transfer
  the web server is down and the results cannot be uploaded.

Candidates are expected to make reference to relevant stakeholders, information
technologies, data and processes. Candidates will be expected to refer to “how the IT system
works” using appropriate IT terminology.

Criterion C — The impact of the social/ethical issue(s) on stakeholders                            [8 marks]

Evaluate the impact of the social/ethical issues on the relevant stakeholders.

Patient advantages may include the following:
  fewer errors compared with manual recording of results – greater accuracy leads to better
  treatment
  patients get better feedback on their blood glucose levels – they will be better-informed
  about their health and able to manage their disease more effectively
  records are archived – past records can be easily accessed
  fewer visits to the doctor/hospital – if levels are acceptable there would not be a need to
  visit the doctor as often.

Patient disadvantages may include the following:
  lack of security of sensitive medical data – hackers may intercept and interpret the results
  during transfer resulting in an invasion of privacy
  reliability of the equipment – leading to errors during data transfer
  reliability of the web server – results cannot be uploaded if the server is unavailable
  difficulty using the equipment – patients may not be computer literate and will need to
  learn how to upload results
  cost of the meter and internet access – will the patient be assisted with this expense?

Health workers’ advantages may include the following:
  ability to graph results – enables health workers to easily check patients’ results and see
  changes in blood glucose levels over time
  database features such as sorting, searching and reporting – allow manipulation of patients’
  results
  less pressure on busy medical staff – patients are entering their own results
  less interruption to the nurses during a working day – results can be viewed at anytime.

Health workers’ disadvantages may include the following:
  liability if the web server is down or there is a malfunction of the equipment – diabetes is a
  serious disease and the doctors/hospital may be held responsible if there are reliability
  issues
  need for training to use this new technology.

If the evaluation does not provide any additional information to that in the article, the
candidate will be awarded a maximum of [2 marks].

Evaluate one solution that addresses at least one problem identified in Criterion C.

Answers may include the following:
Solutions to the problem of reliability:
   ability to manually enter/change results on the website will overcome reliability problems
   with the blood glucose meter
   online tutorials/help files, email support, phone support will assist if reliability problems
   are associated with user error
   alternatives such as phoning in results if the server is down
   strict backup routines and disaster recovery programs will allow data to be reinstated
   should a server crash.

Solutions to the problem of security/privacy:
   encryption of data on the server will help ensure that data is not accessible by unauthorized
   people
   encryption of data during transfer will help secure data from attack during transmission
   levels of password/biometrics will help ensure that data is only accessible to permitted
   health workers.

Solutions to the problem of cost to patients:
   health insurance/medical benefits may allow patients to claim back cost of the meter and
   internet access.

Solutions to the training issues for health workers:
   various types of training could be provided, for example, training workshops, video
   tutorials loaded onto the hospital intranet.

     Overview

     N&Q Investments is an investment company which has operated from Adelaide since 1979.  
     It deals with the financial affairs of numerous clients ranging from individuals and small
     businesses to multinational companies.   With the rapid advances in information technology,
     it found it was able to expand beyond Australia, opening a second office in Los Angeles in 1988.  
 5   Currently N&Q Investments has additional offices in London and Toronto, employing a current
     total of 60 staff, many of whom travel extensively.


     Hector Byrne

     Hector Byrne is an international fund manager based in Adelaide and is employed by
     N&Q Investments.   His clients are predominantly multinational companies and he buys and
     sells shares to increase the value of their investment portfolios.  Over the last decade Hector has
10   developed a good rapport with his clients at face-to-face meetings, seeing a rapid growth in the
     number of his clients, which he believes more than compensates for the large amount of time he
     spends travelling.

     When working in the different N&Q Investments offices, in hotels or at home, he is required
     to have access to the records of clients, which are held on network servers and accessible via
15   a WAN.  When he has to make sales, purchases or fund transfers on behalf of his clients, it must be
     done instantaneously.  Consequently Hector has to maintain contact with colleagues and clients at
     all times, which requires the use of wireless networks that can be accessed via hotspots at airports,
     hotels and other public places.  When operating using a wireless network Hector is concerned
     that correspondence between him and the Head Office or any notes he makes about clients for his
20   personal use should remain completely confidential.

     There are issues about the levels of security of the wireless networks in some of the locations
     he uses.   In some cases the network is unsecured and requires no username or password.  
     Other networks, for example in airports, do not change login details for long periods of time.  
     In some hotels, connecting to the network requires either so much time or the level of security
25   appears so low that Hector questions whether it is a valid use of time or it creates an unnecessary
     risk to the confidentiality of company information.   Therefore, he works offline and moves
     company information between his laptop, his home PC and his personal hand held device.  He then
     sends the information by email to colleagues and clients.

     When Hector is working from home, he often needs to access the N&Q Investments WAN.  
30   He has found that he can connect his laptop to the internet by searching for an available unsecured
     wireless network or he can use the broadband cable connection on his home desktop PC but on a
     number of occasions has left sensitive client data saved on the hard drive.  Hector often finds that
     working from home causes a dilemma.  He has to choose between using the unsecured wireless
     connection or leaving sensitive data on his hard drive and can only see the problem getting worse
35   as his teenage children will increasingly require the home PC.  To resolve this issue Hector is
     considering creating a home network; however, his son has warned him that there will be security
     issues involved in setting this up and he must first address them.




                                                                                              Turn over

     Recent developments

     In the last 6 months, N&Q Investments has opened new offices in Shanghai, Mumbai, Nairobi,
     Buenos Aires and Moscow, recruiting a number of employees to carry out duties similar
40   to Hector’s.   However, N&Q Investments is trying to reposition itself as an environmentally
     responsible organization and is concerned about its “carbon footprint” and the escalating
     travel costs, particularly with the need to train staff in the new offices.  Following a number of
     senior management meetings, N&Q Investments is investigating a range of IT solutions to address
     this problem.

45   With the new organizational structure, Hector is now the line manager of Betty Gonzalez, who is
     based in the new Buenos Aires office.  Betty will carry out duties similar to Hector’s and has been
     provided with a laptop computer by her local office.  Unfortunately, Hector has found that her
     laptop has different specifications and uses different versions of software.  Hector and Betty are
     both concerned as this will potentially cause problems in sharing and editing documents.


     Technical background

50   • Each office has a technical department, which is responsible for the maintenance and upgrade
       of all IT equipment.  The maintenance of the WAN is controlled by the technical staff at the
       head office.
     • Each office of the company is connected via a WAN.
     • Client data is held on the database at the head office.
55   • Hector uses a wireless enabled laptop configured by the company’s IT department.
     • When travelling, Hector carries with him a laptop, PDA and cell/mobile phone.
     • Hector’s home PC has a broadband cable connection to the internet that is used by all
       the family.
     • Hector uses email to keep up to date with colleagues and transfer information.

         Challenges faced

   60    With the possible significant increase in staff travel, N&Q Investments is also investigating
         a range of alternatives to replace face-to-face meetings between staff in the established and
         new offices.  The senior managers at N&Q Investments have proposed the use of video conferencing
         or virtual meetings but Hector is concerned that the quality of the outcomes from these meetings
         may be compromised.

   65    With continued growth, issues are arising such as the lack of compatibility between Hector’s and
         Betty’s laptops, so the company is considering commissioning a report from a specialist consultancy
         company to evaluate emerging issues relating to company practice and policies, security and
         data integrity.

         The company is aware of the problems that arise when employees use multiple devices such
   70    as laptops, PDAs and cell/mobile phones, which could lead to numerous different versions of the
         same document as well as the possible theft of these devices.

        Hector and many of his colleagues work from home on a regular basis.  The company is concerned
        that many of the home networks set up by its employees are not secure and could potentially be a
        route that hackers would use to access sensitive customer information.

Your response to question 4 must include evidence of independent research linked to the N&Q Investments
case study.

4.   Betty “has been provided with a laptop computer by her local office.  Unfortunately,
     Hector has found that her laptop has different specifications and uses different
     versions of software.   Hector and Betty are both concerned as this will potentially
     cause problems in sharing and editing documents.” (lines 46–49)

     Evaluate two possible strategies that N&Q Investments could adopt in order to
     reduce the problems with sharing and editing documents.                                                                                                                                                       [12 marks]

     network he intends to use in his home.                                         [8 marks]

     The question asks for two methods. Please annotate the script with M1 and M2, etc. to
     indicate the start of each method. Do not credit further methods if given. Do not treat
     brief erroneous comments as a “method”.

     Answers may include the following methods:
       use of firewall
       use of anti-virus/anti-spyware/other malware protection
       secure your wireless router or access point
       set up admin rights
       set up admin password/settings
       don’t use default password
       don’t use default settings for the device connected to the network
       don’t broadcast SSID
       change the default SSID
       this should prevent sniffers
       enable WPA or WEP encryption
       WPA is more secure than WEP
       use long keys
       change keys often
       use MAC filtering for controlling access to your WLAN
       only designated computers can access the network
       reduce your WLAN transmitter power
       disable remote administration.

     In this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS terminology
     between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to social and
     ethical impacts.
