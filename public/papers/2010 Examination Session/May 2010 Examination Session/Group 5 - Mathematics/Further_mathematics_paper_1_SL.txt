Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this
is shown by written working. All students should therefore be advised to show their working.

      A university Mathematics Department admits students on the basis of performance
      in an entrance examination which is graded ‘excellent’, ‘very good’ or ‘good’.
      The students sit their final examination three years later when they are awarded
      ‘first class’, ‘second class’ or ‘third class’ degrees. The results for a particular group
      of students are summarised in the following table.

                                 First class        Second class            Third class
                Excellent            30                 14                      6
                Very good             8                 12                      5
                Good                  5                  6                      14

      Stating your hypotheses, use an appropriate test to investigate at the 1 % level of
      significance whether or not there is an association between performance in the entrance
      examination and performance in the final examination. Justify your answer.

      Let S be the set of matrices given by

      (b)   The relationship between a , b , c and d is changed to ad − bc = n . State, with
            a reason, whether or not there are any non-zero values of n , other than 1,
