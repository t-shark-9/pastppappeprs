Answer all the questions.

1.    An array of  Player objects called  topTen[], contains the names and scores of the
      10 highest scoring players in a computer game.  These are stored in descending order
      of score.  A  Player object is defined by the class  Player shown below.

      public class Player
      {
        String name;    // name of player
        int score;		    // player’s score

            public Player(String name, int score)
            {
              this.name = name;
              this.score = score;
            }
      }

      (a)     State the purpose of the constructor  public Player().                              [2 marks]

      The first three members of the array  topTen[] are shown below.

      topTen[]                  [0]                    [1]                      [2]
                           Jo         964       Pete         900        Fernanda      840

      (b)     State the value of

              (i)    topTen[1].name ;                                                             [1 mark]

              (ii)   topTen[2].score .                                                            [1 mark]

      At the end of each game a new  Player object is created.  The method  compare()
      receives this  Player object with the details of the game and compares the new score
      with those in the array  topTen[].  It then returns the position in which the new score
      should be in this array, or the value –1 if the score is not high enough.

      (c)     Construct the method  compare(), which has been started below.

              // the array topTen[] is declared globally.
              public int compare(Player latest)
              {
                // lines of code missing
              }                                                                                   [5 marks]




                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      If the value returned by the method  compare() is not –1, the method  updateList()
      is called, which inserts the new  Player object into its correct position in the array.

      (d)   The method  updateList() works as follows:
            • a temporary array of  Player objects is created
            • the new best 10 results are placed in this temporary array
            • the array  topTen[] is made equal to this temporary array.

            Construct the method  updateList(), which has been started below.

            public static void updateList(Player latest, int position)
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }                                                                                   [8 marks]

      (e)   Without writing any code, suggest an alternative way of writing  updateList()
            which does not create a temporary array.                                            [3 marks]

2.    A program controlling the arrival of flights at an airport contains two linked lists.

      The first list (List A), is continually updated so that it contains data for each flight
      that will arrive during that day.   The list is maintained in order of the expected
      landing times.  These expected landing times often change.  

      Part of the linked list, showing the flight numbers and expected landing times,
      is given below.

      headA      MX2460 10:15          KL4231 10:20         DU21 10:44          …   …         null


      (a)   Explain why a linked list would be a good choice of data structure for this
            application.                                                                             [3 marks]

      (b)   Flight number BA3644 has expected landing time 10:40.  Explain, with the help
            of a diagram, how a node containing this data would be added to the list.                [5 marks]

      Part of the class  Node that defines a linked list node is shown below.

      public class Node
      {
        public String flightNumber;
        public Node next;
        // other data members not shown
      }

      (c)   Construct the method  displayListA(), which displays the flight numbers
            in List A.                                                                               [4 marks]




                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      The second linked list (List B) contains a list of flights that have landed.

      The class that manages the two linked lists is called  Arrivals .  The class is shown
      below with one of its methods.

      public class Arrivals
      {
        static Node headA;             // points to the 1st node in List A
        static Node headB;             // points to the 1st node in List B

            public static void landed(String flightLanded)
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
      }

      Part of the method  landed() is shown above.  It receives, as a parameter, the flight
      number of the flight that has just landed.  It then deletes the node representing this
      flight from List A and adds it to the end of List B.

      (d)     Construct the method  landed().

              You can assume that neither of the two lists is empty and that the flight number
              exists in List A.                                                                  [8 marks]

                                                     –6–                 M10/5/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

3.    An Employee file contains several employee records stored on disk.   Access to a
      particular record is provided by a partial index which is also stored on disk.

      (a)   Describe the steps needed to create the partial index for this file.                  [4 marks]

      Each day an application is run which updates the Employee file.  To make the process
      more efficient, the partial index is first read into a suitable dynamic data structure in
      the memory.

      (b)   Suggest, with reasons, one suitable data structure.                                   [3 marks]

      (c)   For the data structure suggested in part (b), explain how the partial index is used
            to access a particular record.                                                        [6 marks]

      (d)   (i)    State two disadvantages of replacing the partial index with a full index.      [2 marks]

            (ii)   Explain one advantage of replacing the partial index with a full index.        [2 marks]

      (e)   Describe a method of providing fast access to an individual record that does not
            involve the use of an index.                                                          [3 marks]

4.    This question involves the use of the case study.

      (a)   The construction of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 included a new control tower for the
            whole airport.  The changeover was carried out by running the new system in
            parallel with the old system.

            Outline one reason for choosing a parallel form of changeover, as opposed to
            any other.                                                                              [2 marks]

      (b)   Suggest why the airport authorities chose the particular testing strategy outlined
            on page 4 of the case study.                                                            [2 marks]

      (c)   (i)    Identify an airport system that would use real-time processing.                   [1 mark]

            (ii)   Explain, for the system identified in part (i), why it would require real-time
                   processing.                                                                      [3 marks]

      (d)   A computerized system is being designed to replace the paper flight strips used
            in Air Traffic Control.  A concern of the controllers is that interacting with a
            computer system might distract them from their tasks.

            (i)    Explain why voice recognition would not be suitable as a user interface.         [3 marks]

            (ii)   Describe a user interface that would be suitable.                                [3 marks]

            (iii) Describe one useful feature that could be incorporated into the new
                  user interface, that was not present in the original one.                         [2 marks]

            (iv) Suggest one possible back-up strategy in case of a system failure in
                 Air Traffic Control.                                                               [2 marks]

      (e)   By considering both sides of the argument, discuss whether or not governments
            should have access to the “passenger name records (PNR)” files (see page 10 of
            the case study).                                                                        [6 marks]

      (f)   Explain why more than one firewall might be included in the airport
            computer network.                                                                       [2 marks]

(Question 4 continued)

      (g)   The movement of aircraft on the ground around the airport is captured by sensors,
            which are activated when an aircraft breaks a beam of infra-red light.

            (i)    Explain why an analog-digital converter would not be needed for this
                   sensor data.                                                                 [2 marks]

            The sensor data is used by the Air Traffic Control system to update the display
            in the control centre.

            (ii)   Discuss whether the Air Traffic Control operating system should use
                   polling or interrupts for collecting data from the various sensors.          [4 marks]

      (h)   The Flight Information Display System holds flight information for arrivals for
            the next 24 hours.  Each flight is stored as an  Arrival object.

            Similarly a  Departures object holds data for each flight that will leave
            the airport.

            Discuss how both the  Arrival object and the  Departures object could  inherit
            characteristics from a common  Flight object.                                       [3 marks]

      (i)   An airline uses several self-service kiosks and check-in desks for passenger
            check-in.

            (i)    Identify the clients and server within this system.                          [2 marks]

            (ii)   Describe the roles of the clients and server within the check-in system.     [3 marks]
