Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2
and [30 marks] for question 3. Maximum total = [70 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalising them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

      Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

           (ii)   Award up to [2 marks max].
                  This allows for the new system to be evaluated;
                  Without any consequences if the system fails;
                  As the old system is still functioning;                                 [2 marks]

     (c)   Award [2 marks] for each procedure, up to [4 marks max].
           Separate access requirements for different parts of the airport;
           This will restrict an illegal access to one section only;

           The use of passwords/biometrics etc.;
           To enter any section;
           Note: Only accept the first biometric example if two are given.

           CCTV cameras;

           (ii)   e.g. for the control tower
                  Input data must be processed immediately;

Question 3 continued

     (e)   (i)    Several people are likely to be in the control tower;
                  Whose voices could be mistakenly received by the voice recognition system;
                  Leading to wrong information being input / delays in processing genuine
                  commands / potentially dangerous situations;

                  Allow answers that focus on the inaccuracy of voice recognition.                 [3 marks]

           (ii)   Award up to [3 marks max].
                  A touch screen might be suitable;
                  Commands could be given by touching various menus/boxes;
                  Different airplanes could be represented graphically on the screen;
                  Whose position could be changed by touch;                                        [3 marks]

           (iii) Award [1 mark] for a realistic suggestion and [1 mark] for outlining its use.
                 Example:
                 Airplane graphic on screen changes size/colour/makes noise;
                 To show relative proximity to the airport;                                    [2 marks]

           (iv) Award up to [2 marks max].
                The previous system (paper strip) could be kept functioning;
                With all data entering both systems;
                So that it could take over if needed;

                  The system could be mirrored;
                  Using the old control tower / separate server;
                  With all data entering both systems;

                  Divert all airplanes;
                  To another airport;

                  Do not award any marks for a strategy that would either lose data or would
                  involve a significant interruption in processing.                          [2 marks]

     (f)   There are many possible answers, including ones based on personal experiences.
           For each side of the argument, award [1 mark] for an indication of the side,
           [1 mark] for stating why and [1 mark] for an explanation, up to [3 marks max]
           for each side.

           Examples:
           Governments are ultimately responsible for the safety of its citizens;
           Therefore have the right to take any measures necessary;
           To identify threats;

           This information should not be made widely available;
           As it is private/confidential;
           And medical details etc. could be used against the interests of the passenger;

           Governments’ proven inability to keep data secure could also lead to a correct answer. [6 marks]
