Mark Allocation

Section A:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
Section B:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 60 marks.
              Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalising them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

4.   Accept any reasonable answers, given that characteristics evolve rapidly.

     Award up to [2 marks max] for an appropriate application of each with reference to backup.
     Example:

     up immediately when needed.

     Award up to [2 marks max] for the advantages/disadvantages of each.
     Example1:
     Flash memory is more portable between machines – tape has large capacity and can be
     programmed to back up as a batch job.
     Example2:
     Tape has sequential access (slower), flash memory has direct access (faster).
     Example3:
     Tape is cheaper per GB but hardware needed is more expensive.                       [4 marks]


5.   Private class members can only be accessed from within the class (in which they

            There is no extra cost;
            Benefits can be gained immediately;
            Since new system is better than the old;

            Example disadvantages:
            Staff re-training will be more lengthy/difficult/in advance/not on the system;
            As they will need to be capable of using the system immediately without training;
            If there is an unsuspected bug in the new system;
            There is not a second system to fall back on/disastrous for the company;

            Accept answers which give valid advantages or disadvantages to changing the
            system when it is not being used.                                           [5 marks]

           explained.
           Advantage:
                 Less code to write;
                 Less repetition than in iteration methods;
           Disadvantage:
                 More complicated to code;
                 Slower Execution;
                 Can use more memory when executed;                                    [4 marks]

                                                                               Total: [10 marks]

17.   (a)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
            Award [1 mark] for correct root (the word “Root” does not have to appear).
            Award [2 marks] for correct order (allow mirror image).
            (Award [1 mark] if there is no more than one mistake.)
            (Award [1 mark] if there is only the German word.)
            Award [1 mark] for correct null pointers.                                         [4 marks]




      (b)   (i)    Award [1 mark] for a suitable advantage and [1 mark] for an elaboration
                   up to [2 marks max].
                   Example:
                   A binary tree is quick to search;
                   Especially if it is well balanced as the number of comparisons is small; [2 marks]

            (ii)   Award [1 mark] for a suitable advantage and [1 mark] for an elaboration
                   up to [2 marks max].
                   Example:
                   A single linked list is efficient in adding and deleting items;
                   As only the pointers have to be readjusted;                             [2 marks]

      (c)   Award [1 mark] for a suitable suggestion and [1 mark] for an elaboration up to
            [2 marks max].
            Example:
            A second set of pointers could be introduced to give English alphabetical order;
            Head (root) pointer would point to the first word in English and the tail would be
            after the last word in alphabetical order;
            Doubly linked list with two external pointers;
            First to give German and second to give English alphabetical order;                [2 marks]

                                                                                      Total: [10 marks]

18.   (a)   Verification: The potential member will have to type in their password twice and
            it will be checked against the first one;
            Validation: The format of payment details/personal details will be checked
            against the expected format and rejected if they are not of the correct format;  [2 marks]

      (b)   Award up to [3 marks max].
            When member first applies the payment method;
            The personal details should be encrypted;
            Each time the member logs in, user name and password should be encrypted;
            For transmission between member computer and server (accept this once
            anywhere);                                                                [3 marks]

      (c)   Award up to [2 marks max].
            The protocols are an agreed way/set of rules for communicating when transferring
            data;

            Packets of data include information to get from sender to receiver;
            Each packet will contain destination/number in packet;
            Protocols ensure that machines with different platforms can communicate;         [2 marks]

      (d)   Each time an order is confirmed/article bought the number in stock is reduced
            by one;                                                                                [1 mark]

      (e)   Award up to [2 marks max].
            When a member makes an enquiry (if stock is low);
            That item is made unavailable/blocked to others;

            If not bought it is unblocked;

            Accept also
            A system that does not block but halts a member in the process of buying;
            To say that it is no longer available if another member has bought in the
            meantime;                                                                 [2 marks]
