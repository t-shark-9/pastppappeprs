Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is wrong, some marks may be given
for correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Working may be continued below the box,
if necessary. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      (a)   Calculate the exact volume of the container. Give your answer as a fraction.      [3 marks]

      Jim estimates the dimensions of the container as 15 m, 2 m and 3 m and uses these to
      estimate the volume of the container.

      (b)   Calculate the percentage error in Jim’s estimated volume of the container.        [3 marks]
