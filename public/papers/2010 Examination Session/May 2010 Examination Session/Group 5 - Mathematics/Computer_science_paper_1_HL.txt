            when the customer ID is known and state the BigO efficiency of this search.         [2 marks]

      Another field in the customer record is  date payment due. At the end of each month,
      the database is searched to find all customers whose payment is due.

      (c)   Identify the type of processing used in this search.                                [1 mark]

15.   A washing machine which has several different programs can be set to start working
      at a specified time.  The time to start and the required program are input by a user.  
      The washing machine is controlled by a microprocessor.

      (a)   Identify two items that would need to be held in read-only memory (ROM).            [2 marks]

      (b)   Identify two items that would need to be held in random access memory (RAM).        [2 marks]

      The microprocessor controls water input (W), heating (H) and rotation (R).
      The following table shows the state of these controls for whether or not the
      washing machine is operating (M).

17.   An online dictionary translates between English and German. When a user knows the
      German word they can find the English word and when a user knows the English word
      they can find the German word.

      A sample of the word pairs that are stored is as follows:

                                      GERMAN ENGLISH
                                      Fisch   Fish

                                      Karotte Carrot

      Assume that these five pairs are input in the order shown.

      (a)   Construct the binary tree which stores the above list of pairs in alphabetical
            order by German word, showing the information which would need to be held at
            each leaf of the tree.                                                            [4 marks]

      This data could also be represented as a single linked list in alphabetical order by
      German word.

      (b)   (i)    Explain one advantage of using a binary tree.                              [2 marks]

		          (ii)   Explain one advantage of using a single linked list.                       [2 marks]

      (c)   Suggest how this single linked list could be modified to allow translation from
            English to German as well as from German to English.                              [2 marks]

      email address and password. To order from the site a member must enter a username
      and a password.

      (a)   Outline the use of verification and validation in the completion of the
            membership form.                                                                [2 marks]

      (b)   Outline the way in which encryption should be used in this system.              [3 marks]

      (c)   Explain the role of protocols when a member accesses the site.                  [2 marks]

      product but there is only one left.

      Some products are in limited supply and cannot be replaced.

      (d)   Outline a way in which the web server could be updated on the number of
            products in stock.                                                              [1 mark]

      (e)   Suggest how the web server would avoid the situation of two people buying the
            last item at the same time.                                                     [2 marks]
