Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is wrong, some marks may be given
for correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Working may be continued below the box,
if necessary. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

1.    José stands 1.38 kilometres from a vertical cliff.

      (a)   Express this distance in metres.                                                    [1 mark]

      José estimates the angle between the horizontal and the top of the cliff as 28.3 and
      uses it to find the height of the cliff.

                                                                         diagram not to scale

                                                 1.38 km

      (b)   Find the height of the cliff according to José’s calculation. Express your answer
            in metres, to the nearest whole metre.                                              [3 marks]

      (c)   The actual height of the cliff is 718 metres. Calculate the percentage error made
            by José when calculating the height of the cliff.                                   [2 marks]
