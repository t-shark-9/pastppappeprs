Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

      Anna cycles to her new school.  She records the times taken for the first ten days with
      the following results (in minutes).

                   12.4 13.7 12.5 13.4 13.8 12.3 14.0 12.8 12.6 13.5

      Assume that these times are a random sample from the N ( µ , σ 2 ) distribution.

      (a)   Determine unbiased estimates for µ and σ 2 .                                              [2 marks]

      (b)   Calculate a 95 % confidence interval for µ .                                              [3 marks]

      (c)   Before Anna calculated the confidence interval she thought that the value of µ
            would be 12.5. In order to check this, she sets up the null hypothesis H 0 : µ = 12.5 .

		          (i)    Use the above data to calculate the value of an appropriate test statistic.  
                   Find the corresponding p-value using a two-tailed test.

		          (ii)   Interpret your p-value at the 1 % level of significance, justifying your
                   conclusion.                                                                        [7 marks]

      The random variable  X has a Poisson distribution with mean µ .  The value of µ is
      known to be either 1 or 2 so the following hypotheses are set up.

                                         H 0 : µ = 1; H1 : µ = 2

      A random sample x1 , x2 , ..., x10 of 10 observations is taken from the distribution of  X
      and the following critical region is defined.

      (b)   a Type II error.                                                                          [5 marks]

      The random variable  X is assumed to have probability density function  f , where

      (b)   A random sample of 180 values of  X was obtained and the following table
            produced.

      A shop sells apples, pears and peaches. The weights, in grams, of these three types of
      fruit may be assumed to be normally distributed with means and standard deviations
      as given in the following table.

      Brian’s peach.

            sample of 6 of these balls is selected without replacement. Calculate the mean
            and the variance of the number of red balls in the sample.                               [7 marks]
