Answer all the questions.

1.    (a)   Suggest a suitable data structure that can hold the responses to a set of
            100 questions, where each response is either “yes” or “no”.  Include reasons for
            your suggestion.                                                                   [4 marks]

      (b)   Using the data structure suggested in part (a), construct the method yesTotals()
            that will return the total number of “yes” responses.   The method has been
            started below.

            public int yesTotals()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }                                                                                  [4 marks]

      The method numberSorter() receives an  int array of unknown length (but with
      a maximum of 100 items), and places the integers into three different arrays a, b
      and c, where

            a = negative integers
            b = non-negative even integers
            c = integers neither in  a nor in  b.

      The method then returns the number of items in array b.

      (c)   Construct the method numberSorter(), which has been started below.  You can
            assume that the arrays are initially empty.

            public int numberSorter(int[] original)
            {
              // lines of code missing
              if (...
                 // lines of code missing
              else
                 // lines of code missing
            }                                                                                  [8 marks]

      (d)   Without writing any code, suggest how the method numberSorter() could
            be modified so that it not only returns the total number of elements in array b,
            but also returns the total number of elements in array a.  No additional methods
            should be considered.                                                              [4 marks]

2.    A master file has been created that contains details of the players in a soccer
      (football) league.  Each record in the file contains the name of the player and the total
      number of goals that they have scored.  The records are stored in alphabetical order of
      the players’ names.

      The first three records are shown below:

               Record 0                     Record 1                        Record 2
            name     goals                name    goals                  name     goals

      The master file is updated each week by a transaction file.

      (a)     Outline the differences between a master file and a transaction file.                 [2 marks]

      Each week the following processing then takes place:

      •     a user inputs data into a new transaction file which has the same record structure as
            the master file and which contains details of the goal scorers for that week
      •     the transaction file is sorted into the same order as the master file
      •     the master file is updated by the transaction file
      •     the total number of goals scored that week is printed out.

      (b)     Draw a systems flowchart for the above processing.                                    [6 marks]

      For the update process to take place, the records in the master file are read into the
      array master[], which is an array of Player objects.  A Player object is defined by
      the class Player, shown below.

      class Player
      {
        public String name;             // name of player
        public int goals;               // number of goals scored by that player
      }

      The records in the transaction file are read into the array transaction[] which is
      also an array of Player objects.

      (c)     Explain why it is important to have both the master file and the transaction file
              in the same order.                                                                    [2 marks]




                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

                                                    –4–                  M10/5/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

(Question 2 continued)

      (d)   With reference to the data given in the original master file, state the value of

            (i)    master[0].name ;                                                               [1 mark]

            (ii)   master[2].goals .                                                              [1 mark]

      The update process is as follows:

      repeat for each player in the array  transaction[]
      • search sequentially in the array  master[], until the same player is found
      • update the number of goals scored for that player.

      The method update() performs this process and also returns the total number of
      goals scored for that week.

      (e)   Construct the method update(), which has been started below.

            // both arrays are declared as class (global) variables
            public int update()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }

            You can assume that all the players that appear in the transaction file are already
            in the master file.                                                                   [8 marks]

3.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   The construction of Heathrow’s Terminal 5 included a new control tower for the
            whole airport.  The changeover was carried out by running the new system in
            parallel with the old system.

            (i)    Outline what is meant by running systems in parallel.                            [2 marks]

            (ii)   Outline one reason for choosing a parallel form of changeover, as opposed
                   to any other.                                                                    [2 marks]

      (b)   Suggest why the airport authorities chose the particular testing strategy outlined
            on page 4 of the case study.                                                            [2 marks]

      (c)   Describe two different security procedures that would help prevent physical
            access by unauthorised people into restricted sections of the airport.                  [4 marks]

      (d)   (i)    Identify an airport system that would use real-time processing.                  [1 mark]

            (ii)   Explain, for the system identified in part (i), why it would require real-time
                   processing.                                                                      [3 marks]

      (e)   A computerized system is being designed to replace the paper flight strips used
            in Air Traffic Control.  A concern of the controllers is that interacting with a
            computer system might distract them from their tasks.

            (i)    Explain why voice recognition would not be suitable as a user-interface.         [3 marks]

            (ii)   Describe a user-interface that would be suitable.                                [3 marks]

            (iii) Describe one useful feature that could be incorporated into the new
                  user interface, that was not present in the original one.                         [2 marks]

            (iv) Suggest one possible back-up strategy in case of a system failure in
                 Air Traffic Control.                                                               [2 marks]

      (f)   By considering both sides of the argument, discuss whether or not governments
            should have access to the “passenger name records (PNR)” files (see page 10 of
            the case study).                                                                        [6 marks]
