Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 20 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 40 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking
      points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the
      incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should
      be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the mark scheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalise candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

                  new equipment and tooling;                                                      [1]

           (iii) Award [3] for one strategy.
                 target market research;
                 into competitive products;
                 and the prices they sell at;

                  user research;

2.   (a)   Award [1] for something along the lines of:
           the permanent deformation of a solid/material due to an applied force/load;            [1]

     (b)   Award [3] for something along the lines of:
           the chair requires tubes to be bent (formed);
           the metal used for the tubes needs to plastically deform easily;
           so it stays in the deformed shape when the stress (load) is released;                  [3]
                                                –7–              M10/4/DESTE/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



3.   (a)   Award [1] for:
           a (volume) production process involving machines controlled by computers;      [1]

     (b)   Award [3] for something along the lines of:
           both give consumers the opportunity to modify a design;
           mass customization uses automation;
           craft production uses human manual skills;                                     [3]
                                                       –8–             M10/4/DESTE/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                                SECTION B

4.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for:
                  batch;                                                                          [1]

           (ii)   Award [2] for one reason:
                  unusual design;
                  unlikely to have mass appeal;

                  range of colours;
                  so a set number produced of each;

                  many other chairs on the market for consumers;
                  most chairs are batch produced to give choice;

                  famous designer so high prices;
                  limited market at the high price;                                           [2 max]

           (iii) Award [2] for one reason:
                 cost to manufacturer;
                 the more colours produced the greater the cost;

                  reduce waste;
                  the more colours produced the greater the chance of unsold chairs;          [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for:
                  50th;                                                                           [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for stating comfort as the factor and [2] for an explanation:
                  seat is a hard surface;
                  so less comfortable than a cushioned seat;

                  seat surface is smooth;
                  so reduced grip for a seated person;

                  no adjustability;
                  so different sized users cannot adjust the seat to suit their body sizes;

                  no armrests;
                  so nothing to grip on when getting out of the chair;

                  shape/form of the chair;
                  does not suit all types of bodies;                                          [3 max]
                                                –9–                M10/4/DESTE/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   (i)    Award [2] for one test:
             strength;
             to test it is strong enough for a range of users;

             durability;
             to test the hardness of the surface so it does not scratch or splinter easily;

             safety;
             to test the stability of the chair if someone stands on it;                      [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [3] for each issue.
             size of curves;
             has to be carefully worked out;
             so the seat is the correct height from the floor;

             geometry of the chair;
             needs to be carefully calculated;
             so it functions as a stable product;

             the angle of the backrest;
             needs to fit in with the curved form of the chair;
             but also allow for the comfort of the user;

             no armrests to push on;
             so the form of the chair has to be designed to allow users to get up;
             without straining their back or legs;

             the form of the curved shapes at the front of the chair;
             needs to ensure that no pressure is applied to the back of users’ legs;
             but adequate support is given to the thighs;

             stackability;
             two chairs complement each other in form;
             to ensure they can be stacked on top of each other/save space;

             seat slopes backwards;
             so the user’s legs are supported behind the knees;
             and the back is supported;

             smooth curves to the form;
             provides a rhythmic shape;
             with no sharp edges;                                                             [9 max]

5.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for
                  hardness;                                                                        [1]

           (ii)   Award [2] for:
                  the cap will be volume produced by injection moulding;
                  polypropylene is a suitable material for injection moulding;                     [2]

           (iii) Award [2] for one reason:
                 there may not have been a market for the pen;
                 when Biro first invented it;

                  Biro may not have had the personal finance to undertake the production;
                  as manufacturing the pens in quantity would be expensive;

                  Biro may not have had the business acumen;
                  to convert his invention into an innovation;

                  Biro may not have been able to persuade individuals or organisations to
                  invest in his idea;
                  so he could not manufacture the pen in quantity;

                  the manufacturing technology to produce the pen at a cost-effective price;
                  may not have been available in 1938;                                         [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for any of:
                  the user can see how much ink has been used/is available;
                  aesthetics/style;                                                            [1 max]

           (ii)   Award [3] for one reason:
                  the flat surfaces provide edges;
                  which assists the user in gripping the pen;
                  and allows the pen to be picked up easily/ used in any position;                 [3]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] per distinct point in a suitable outline [2 max]:
             it is designed to be disposable;
             so has a limited product life;

             it cannot be refilled/repaired/reused;
             therefore it has a limited product life;                                   [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [3 max] for each reason.
             stood the test of time;
             still a global product;
             with high volume of sales;

             a low-cost item;
             which is affordable by a large cross-section of society;
             and is often purchased by institutions e.g. offices;

             cost-effective to produce;
             uses available materials and technology;
             so can be produced in many countries;

             value-for-money for consumers;
             who often purchase the same item many times;
             if satisfied with it;

             the design of the pen is not culturally specific;
             so it fits into varied environments worldwide;
             which makes it recognisable in global environments;

             dominant design;
             the design has changed very little over 150 years;
