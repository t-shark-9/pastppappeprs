Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme
General

A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

         Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

         An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”. Either wording can
          be accepted.

         Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

         Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

         The order of points does not have to be as written (unless stated otherwise).

         If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same
          as that in the markscheme, then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be
          particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

         Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have got
          correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong.

         Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
          more important than grammatical accuracy.

         Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
          subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the
          incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
          be awarded. Indicate this with “ECF”, error carried forward.

         Units should always be given where appropriate. Omission of units should only be penalized
          once. Indicate this by “–1(U)” at the first point it occurs. Ignore this, if marks for units are
          already specified in the markscheme.

         Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
          the markscheme.

           (iii) some small mammals species may be caught/eaten more often than others
                 by owls because they;

                   range of owl foraging may be very wide / area of foraging;
                   sample of pellets may be too small to see full range of species;

           landfill site A disadvantages:
           scenic coastal location could be spoilt;
           prevailing winds could carry smell to city;
           at risk from coastal flooding;
           could cause coastal pollution;

           landfill site B advantages:
           close to road/rail;
           close to city so short transport time;
           low lying/flat land so landfill easier to manage/less visually obtrusive;
           wind carries smell away from city;
           landfill site B disadvantages:
           on flood plain so could be at risk of flooding;
           leaching pollutants could contaminate nearby river;
           close to city so land may be expensive to buy/needed for expansion;
           land likely to be good agricultural land for food production;

           landfill site C advantages:
           far away from city so fewer people affected by development;
           higher land so no risk from flooding;
           smell unlikely to carry to city;
           landfill site C disadvantages:
           near wildlife reserve;
           not near road/rail network;
           waste must be transported uphill;
           site high up so more visually obtrusive;                                        [2 max]

             textiles;
             nappies/diapers;
             electrical appliances e.g. computers/fridges etc. (WEE);
             waste wood;
             rubble/bricks;
             ash;                                                                     [1 max]
             Award [1] for any three of the above.
             Accept any other reasonable suggestions.

      (ii)   recycling: [2 max]
             advantage:
             less energy used in recycling metal/paper/glass;
             reduces amount of resources used;
             maintains stocks of non-renewable/replenishable resources;
             disadvantage:
             uses energy;
             causes pollution;
             affected by economic demand and supply factors (and so sometimes
             uneconomic);

             re-use: [2 max]
             advantage:
             little energy used;
             provides cheap resources for people of limited means;
             disadvantage:
             may use some energy to clean;
             may be heavy to transport e.g. reusable milk bottles;
             eventually wear out/must be disposed of;

             composting: [2 max]
             advantage:
             produces fertilizer;
             reduces volume of waste;
             reduces use of chemical fertilizers;
             disadvantage:
             unpleasant smells / can attract vermin if not done properly;
             requires effort/space;
             takes time;
                                 – 13 –           M10/3/ENVSO/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


incineration: [2 max]
advantage:
reduces volume of waste;
heat produced can be used in place of burning fossil fuels;
kills pathogens;
produces ash for construction;
disadvantage:
toxic chemicals released / incomplete combustion releases dioxins;
produces greenhouse gases;
ash still needs disposal;
expensive;
considerable community resistance to building of new incinerators;
dumping at sea: [2 max]
advantage:
no smells;
land is available for other purposes;
no problem with vermin;
disadvantage:
damage/disruption of marine ecosystems;
waste may be washed up on beaches;
encourages algal blooms;                                                       [2 max]

Accept any other reasonable suggestion.
A management strategy (recycling, re-use, composting, incineration, dumping
at sea) must be stated, although no marks are awarded. Award [1 max] if no
management strategy is stated or if only advantages/disadvantages are given.
