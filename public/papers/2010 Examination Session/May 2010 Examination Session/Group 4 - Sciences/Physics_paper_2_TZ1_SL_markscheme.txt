Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and ONE question in Section B
[25 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award more
      than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate‟s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent
      significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark. Where this point is
      considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by writing OWTTE (or words to
      that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points.
      If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
      used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
      with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unit errors can only be penalized once in the paper.
      Place ticks for all correct marking points and use the „U‟ stamp from the annotations at the appropriate place.
      The unit error (-1) mark then shows in the „whole paper‟ section of the right hand box and the mark is
      automatically deducted from the whole paper.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for an error
      of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                             e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                          2       reject
                                                        1.6       accept
                                                       1.63       accept
                                                      1.631       accept
                                                    1.6314        reject

      Place ticks for all correct marking points and use the „SD‟ stamp at the appropriate place. The significant
      digit (-1) mark then shows in the „whole paper‟ section of the right hand box and the mark is automatically
      deducted from the whole paper.

          (iv) the power output will be less;
               because the total resistance is greater in the series case;
               hence the current is less and power depends on I 2 ;

Part 2       Heating a liquid

(a)   in boiling, energy is required to break bonds (in vaporization) and to separate
      molecules;
      in melting, (more) energy available to overcome bond energies of molecules without
      large separation;                                                                        [2]

(b)   (i)    evaporation at surface of liquid, boiling occurs throughout liquid;
             evaporation occurs at all temperatures, boiling at boiling pt only;
             boiling: vapour pressure = atmospheric;
             evaporation: vapour pressure < atmospheric;                                   [2 max]

      (ii)   attempt to equate energy gained by milk to energy lost by steam;
             minimum energy required 0.30 3800 62 (70680J);
             energy supplied [steam mass] [2.3 106 4200 20];
             minimum steam mass 0.030kg;                                                       [4]

      (iii) energy required to heat cup;
            energy lost to surroundings / steam escapes from system;                           [2]
