Subject Details:             Physics SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Omission of units should only be penalized once in
      the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first point it occurs and U on the cover sheet.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept
                                                1.6314       reject

      Indicate the mark deduction by writing –1(SD) at the first point it occurs and SD on the cover sheet.
