General Marking Instructions
Subject Details:             Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper.

10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject

E2. (a)   (i)      luminosity is a function of surface and temperature (of star);
                   (same class) same temperature (therefore greater surface area);                   [2]

          (iii) Vega appears dimmer;
                hence distance over-estimated;                                                       [2]
                   accept:
                   Vega will look redder (because blue light scatters more in dust);
                   so Vega looks cooler/lower apparent temperature (thus wrong position on
                   HR diagram);

                 10 3

    (b)   measurement of mass in a given volume is (very) uncertain/difficult;
          there exists dark matter that is difficult to observe;
          measurement of distances is uncertain/difficult;

    (c)   in the early universe the (average) kinetic energy was very high breaking apart any
          nuclei/atoms/too high for atoms to form / as universe expands it cools down allowing
          nuclei in atoms to form;                                                                   [1]

           log 8.4 104      n log 25

          supernova explosion leaving behind core;
          core becomes black hole or neutron star depending on Oppenheimer–Volkoff

            Accept any signal with this frequency.

      (b)   FM has a better signal-to-noise ratio (than AM);
            noise gets added to amplitude and since FM is modulated by frequency FM is less
            susceptible to noise;                                                                [2]
            or
            FM has a greater bandwidth (than AM);
            and so provides for a better quality transmission;
            or
            in FM most of the power is in the sidebands (where the information is) rather than
            the carrier;
            and so transmissions can take place at less power (than AM);

            duration of sample 4 4.0 0.016ms ;

      cellular exchange: [2 max]

      allocates different frequencies to base stations;
      in order to avoid interference between different calls;
      reroutes calls to different base stations when a mobile phone leaves one cell area and
      enters another;                                                                               [4 max]

      (b)   modal dispersion is dispersion due to rays of light taking different paths in
            the fibre;
            material dispersion is dispersion due to the dependence of the speed of light
            on wavelength;                                                                              [2]

Option G — Electromagnetic waves

G1. (a)   Look for these main points.
          (a metastable state i.e.) an excited state in which electrons stay (for unusually)
          longer times than in normal excited states;
          population inversion (in which the number of electrons in a metastable state is
          larger than in the ground state);
          stimulated emission in which an electron of the same energy as the difference in
          energy of atomic energy levels forces a transition from an excited state;                 [3]

            (ii)   0 or 1 or –1;                                                                  [1]

      (b)   two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state;                          [1]

      (c)   (the three quarks are identical because they also have the same spin in this baryon
            and so) are distinguished by their three different colour quantum numbers;            [1]

      (d)   (i)    down;                                                                          [1]

            (ii)   blue-antired / blue-cyan;                                                      [1]

      (e)   violates strangeness conservation which is a property of only the weak interaction;   [1]

            correct topology as shown above, including arrows;
            intermediate particle labelled as W ;
            other four particles u, s , ,    labelled at correct position;                        [3]




J2.   (a)   they are neutral;                                                                     [1]

      (b)   (i)    straight lines out of the “V’s”;                                               [1]

            (ii)   where the lines drawn in (b)(i) intersect;                                     [1]

      (c)   it is moving;
            because the photon paths are not opposite each other;                                 [2]
            Award [0] for correct answer without explanation or incorrect explanation.

      (d)   it is colliding with molecules in the bubble chamber and losing energy;               [1]

J3.   (a)   (i)    e                                               q (u)

                                          ( )



                   e                                               q u

                   with particles correctly labelled and arrows correct;                           [1]

            (ii)   quarks cannot appear as isolated particles due to confinement;
                   other quarks will be created out of the vacuum to form hadrons / OWTTE;         [2]

      (b)   (i)    a process in which the intermediate particle is the Z 0 / a process involving
                   Z 0 exchange;                                                                   [1]

            (ii)   electron                                                up quark

                                                 Z0



                   positron                                                anti-up quark
                   correct diagram as shown;                                                       [1]

      (c)   the Z 0 can couple/interact with an electron and a positron according to
                                             electron

                       Z0
                                                        ;


                                             positron
            and so can be detected through its decay into an electron positron pair;               [2]

      (d)   generation lepton number must be conserved;
            electron has electron lepton number Le       1;
            and so it is an electron antineutrino (which has Le     1 );                           [3]



J4.   the temperature of the (very) early universe was very high but started to fall as the
      universe expanded;
      photons thus had a lot of energy to excite/ionize hydrogen atoms and so were absorbed
      by the gas;
      as the temperature dropped (after sufficient time) the photons no longer had the energy
      to do this and so could go through;                                                          [3]
