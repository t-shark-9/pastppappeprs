General Marking Instructions

Subject Details:             Physics SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Omission of units should only be penalized once in
      the paper.


10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept

Option A — Sight and wave phenomena

A1. (a)   (i)    used in bright light/day-time;
                 there are three types of cone cells sensitive to different colours;
                 few are connected to the same nerve implying greater detail of the image
                 formed;
                 used for photopic vision;                                                        [1 max]

          (ii)   used in dim light/night-time;
                 insensitive to colour;
                 different rod cells are connected to the same nerve implying loss of detail in
                 the image formed;
                 used for scotopic vision;                                                        [1 max]

                      (reaching a maximum at the fovea) / maximum in centre, fewer away
                      from principal axis;
          rod cells: few, near the principal axis, most on the edges of the retina / minimum
                     in centre, more away from principal axis;                                        [2]

    (c)   at x 2.0 m, the amplitude is always equal to A 12sin            0 as required for a
          node;                                                                                       [1]

     (c)   no it cannot;
           because the box spectrum has spectral lines crowding in the infrared rather than in
           the ultraviolet as in the real H spectrum;                                                 [2]

           any electrical potential energy or the hydrogen atom is not one-dimensional or the
           hydrogen atom is not a box etc.
           Award [0] for a bald no and/or a no with an incorrect explanation.

                 Accept either numerical answer. The first estimate is approximate; the
                 discrepancy between the two answers becomes negligible as the decay constant
                 becomes smaller.

    (b)   (i)    (with one isotope present), after each half-life, half the radioactive nuclei
                 would be decaying;
                 and this is not the case here;                                                    [2]

          (ii)   finding time for number of nuclei to reduce by half by using the extreme
                 right part of the curve which is mainly due to the decay of the other isotope;

      (b)   FM has a better signal-to-noise ratio (than AM);

            FM has a greater bandwidth (than AM);

            in FM most of the power is in the sidebands (where the information is) rather than
            the carrier;
