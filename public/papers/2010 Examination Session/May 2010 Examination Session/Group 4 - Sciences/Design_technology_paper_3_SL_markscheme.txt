Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 x 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording
      can be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme, unit
      errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first point
      it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. (a)    Award [1] for a definition of unsaturated fatty acid to the effect of:
           one in which there are double bonds present between the carbons of the fatty
           acid chains;                                                                              [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the
           importance of unsaturated fats to health, [2 max].
           good for health;
           essential compounds/cannot be produced in body (cell membranes, etc.);                    [2]

           unsaturated fatty acids in the development of rancidity and the shelf life of
           cooking oils, [3 max].
           double bonds are susceptible to oxidation;
           this leads to oxidative rancidity;
           this reduces shelf life of product;
           off flavours are produced in oil;                                                         [3]

           even when produced in plastic rather than glass/it has become synonymous with
           the product/what it stands for;

           the colour/lettering is consistent and is recognizable even when not on the bottle;
           this makes it useful for sponsorship, e.g. sports sponsorship;
           uses same packaging for family of products;
           increases sales/market;

           identifiable/recognizable;
           promotes consumer confidence/facilitates product launch for new products
           in family;                                                               [2 max]



A4. Award [1] for identifying one way in which food can influence cancer incidence and [1]
    for a brief explanation, [2 max].
    food may contain carcinogens, either naturally (e.g. plant alkaloids or mycotoxins) or as
    a result of the effect of heat on food;
    carcinogenic substances can cause cancer;

     balanced diet (five a day) provides body with right nutrient mix;
     reduces cancer risk;

     some countries have reduced rates of cancer;
     linked to regional diets;

     some food components (insecticides/pesticides/preservatives/colouring agents) may
     be carcinogenic;
     carcinogenic substances may cause cancer;

     some foods contain substances which protect against cancer;
     e.g. garlic which contains allinase;                                                        [2 max]

A5. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of the influence
    of market pull and of technology push on the development of new food products,
    e.g. ready meals.
    market pull:
    there is increasing demand for lower cost foods;
    more people live alone and many people do not have cooking skills;
    ready meals can be more cost-effective for single people;

     there is an increasing demand for more and more convenience foods;
     working women for example may have less time for cooking/families may not want to
     sit to eat together;
     ready meals can be regenerated quickly using microwave/oven heating;

     technology push:
     freezers/blast chillers;
     aid in production of frozen/chilled ready meals;
     enhance shelf life of product;

A6. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points of explanation of three ways in which
    on-farm processing can enhance farm sustainability [9 max].
    on-farm processing produces products of higher value than the raw materials from
    which they are made;
    thus a larger share of the food dollar stays in the control of the farmer;
    this enhances farm sustainability;

     on-farm processing creates more work in local communities;
     thus more people can stay and work in rural communities;
     jobs related to on-farm processing are more highly skilled and more interesting than
     traditional farm work;

     small-scale food processing can be more appropriate than mass-production;
     craft-produced foods/foods of known provenance command higher prices;
     on-farm processing of foods represents a very lucrative form of farm diversification;

     consumer attitudes;
     farm shops/farmers’ markets;
     have helped change purchasing habits/support for local farmers;

     reduced transport costs for farmer;
     raw materials do not need to be transported for processing;
     saves time/ saves money/increases profit/sustainability;                                   [9 max]

           voltage by the amperes to give the power in watts. Note subtract [1] if units
           are omitted.
           P = V.I = 12 Watts;                                                                   [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying the likely outcome if a 4V torch bulb were to be
           connected to the charged battery by mistake and [1] for a brief explanation,
           [2 max].
           it may blow/overheat;

           450–500 Ω;                                                                            [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of how the logic
           circuit can be used to provide logic 0 when the temperature rises above
           approximately 10oC [3 max].
           above 10oC the value of X falls below 470 Ω;
           so the input to the logic gate rises above 2.5 V;
           the output switches to logic 0;                                                       [3]



B4. Award [1] for identifying one reason why only a fraction of the capacity of a PIC is
    used in many electronics products and [1] for a brief explanation, [2 max].
    generic PICs are made with many inputs/outputs and lots of memory;
    it is more cost effective for a manufacturer to use the same PIC in many different
    products due to economies of scale;                                                          [2]



B5. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how a digital
    hearing aid can be customised to meet the requirements of an individual user initially
    and through the product lifecycle.
    initially:
    audiogram analyses frequency response of an ear;
    hearing aid divides (filters) incoming sound into frequency bands;
    amplifies where appropriate;
    recombines the bands to compensate for hearing deficiencies;

     through the product lifecycle:
     hearing may deteriorate over time;
     a new audiogram can provide the information necessary to re-programme the PIC;
     this extends product life;                                                              [6 max]

B6. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of each of three
    reasons why copper wires are being replaced by fibre optic cables in modern digital
    communication systems based on frequency division multiplexing, [9 max].
    frequency division multiplexing requires a certain bit rate and therefore bandwidth;
    recent applications require a lot more information and therefore bandwidth;
    copper cables have much lower bandwidth and hence capacity than fibre optic cables
    which have a huge bandwidth;

     fibre optic cables are based on light;
     less vulnerable to electromagnetic interference;
     more secure;
     many users share links simultaneously;

     fibre optic cables are more cost-effective;
     copper is expensive, sand is not (fibre optic cable core is made of glass);
     less power is needed to run a fibre optic link;
     repeaters can be spaced further apart;
     copper wires require more maintenance;                                                  [9 max]

          the consumer can check that s/he has all the correct parts/the consumer can see
          how the parts fit together;
          this should make it easier for the consumer to assemble the wardrobe/the
          consumer can see what the finished article should look like;                              [2]

    (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points of discussion of one advantage of using
          CAM in the manufacture of flat-pack, [3 max].
          quality control;
          CAM is a very precise manufacturing process;
          can produce parts with low tolerances;
          this ensures that the parts fit together accurately;

          cost;
          CAM is a very cost-effective system;
          CAM can minimize price for consumer/increase profit for manufacturer;

          mass customization is possible;
          subtle changes to the design can be made easily;
          the revised design can then be produced cheaply and quickly using CAM;                [3 max]

C5. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of two limitations of
    using 3-axis machining to make the product in Figure C5, [6 max].
    time;
    repositioning of the work piece at different angles is time consuming;

E5. Award [1] per distinct point in a suitable discussion of each issue [3 max] × 2
    layout (a) is the most logical design based on human factors;
    as it is easy to identify which controls operate which hob;
    layout (c) is more space efficient but may not be obvious which controls operate
    which hob;

     layout (b) is a compromise between (a) and (c);
     but the shape is odd;
     and would not be suitable for a standardised fitted kitchen;

     although (c) is better for aesthetics;
     and fitting in with other appliances;
     it is not as easy to identify which control knobs operate which hob;

     (c) is less safe than the other arrangements;
     when all four hobs are in use;
     because the user has to lean over the pans on the front hobs to reach pans on the
     rear hobs;                                                                        [6 max]

E6. Award [1] per distinct point in a suitable discussion [3 max] × 3
    space is often allocated based on standardized tasks;
    but different individuals have different personal space needs;
    and may be uncomfortable/compromised by the pre-determined layout;

     lack of flexibility;
     a standardized layout does not offer individuals the opportunity to customize their
     personal space;
     to match their needs;

     research used to decide on the standardized layout;
     may be generic in nature;
     and not appropriate for the needs of all types of office;

     standardization may make the office environment safer;
     as cables etc. can be hidden;
     reducing trip hazard risks;

     use of standard fixtures;
     may provide an unappealing environment;
     which constrains user satisfaction reducing efficiency;

     standardized products and components;
     do not take into account variations in human sizes;
     as one size does not fit all;

     psychological factors such as temperature and light;
     may be standardized throughout the office;
     but individual’s needs vary;

     perception;
     a standardized layout may meet the functional requirements of the office;
     but users may have a different perception of the suitability of the layout;           [9 max]
