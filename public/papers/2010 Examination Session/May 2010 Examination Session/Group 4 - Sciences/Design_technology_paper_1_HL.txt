Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study.   Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

CASE STUDY

The figures below show the britebox™ – a portable light box for the treatment of
Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD).   SAD causes extreme fatigue, greater need for sleep, appetite
changes and depression.  SAD can be treated using light therapy but research shows that people often find
it difficult to make time for treatment.   The britebox™ was developed by Centreline Design using a
pioneering corporate strategy and design for manufacture (DfM).   Computer Aided Design (CAD) was
used to produce a mould for the thermoplastic case of the britebox™.  The company was able to get product
feedback by developing prototypes for use in user trials.

                   product development.

            III.   It enables the company to take advantage of the research and development invested
                   by others.

      A.    I only

      B.    II only
