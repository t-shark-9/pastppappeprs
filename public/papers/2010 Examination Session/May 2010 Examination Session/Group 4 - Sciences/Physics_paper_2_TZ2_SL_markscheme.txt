General Marking Instructions

Subject Details:             Physics SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [25 marks]. Maximum total=[50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded.

9.    Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unit errors can only be penalized once in the paper.

10.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept

    (c)   a straight line cannot be drawn through the error bars and through the origin;
          so height is not directly proportional to the diameter;

                 or
                 increases temperature of the sea;

    (c)   (thermal) energy/heat is lost to the surroundings / (thermal) energy is used to heat
          the calorimeter / some heat is given to the calorimeter;

B3. Part 1       Momentum, energy and power

    (a)   when a force acts on a body an equal and opposite force acts on another body /
          in the interaction between two bodies A and B, the force that A exerts on B is equal
          and opposite to the force that B exerts on A;                                          [1]

    (b)   forces on Earth and book are equal and opposite / no external force acts on the
          system;
          changes in momentum of Earth and book are equal and opposite / net force on
          Earth-book system is zero;
          hence momentum of Earth-book system stays the same/is always zero and so is
          conserved;                                                                             [3]

Part 2       Electric and gravitational fields

(a)   a conductor contains “free” electrons and insulators do not / OWTTE;                     [1]

(b)   to have a current electrons must be accelerated/move along the wire;
      and so a (electric) force must act on them;
      this is provided by the electric field;                                                  [3]

(d)   similarity:
      both follow an inverse square law;
      difference:
      gravitational force is always attractive/is much weaker than electric force / electric
      force can be repulsion/is much stronger than gravitational force;                        [2]
