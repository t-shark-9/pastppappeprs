Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain the importance of price elasticity of demand and cross-elasticity of
            demand for business decision-making.                                                 [10 marks]

      (b)   Studies have shown that the demand for tobacco tends to be highly price inelastic.
            Evaluate the view that governments can best reduce smoking by substantially
            increasing taxes on cigarettes.                                                      [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Explain why a country may wish to reduce its unemployment rate.                      [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the likely effects on the economy of relying on demand-side policies to
            reduce the unemployment rate.                                                        [15 marks]


3.    (a)   There has been an increasing trend in different parts of the world for countries
            to engage in economic integration through the formation of trading blocs.
            Using suitable examples, explain the different types of trading bloc that may
            be formed.                                                                           [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate a country’s decision to join a free trade area (FTA).                       [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the difference between economic growth and economic development,
            and how each of these may be measured.                                               [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the best way that developed countries can help the growth
            and development process of very poor, highly indebted countries is through a
            general cancellation of debts.                                                       [15 marks]
