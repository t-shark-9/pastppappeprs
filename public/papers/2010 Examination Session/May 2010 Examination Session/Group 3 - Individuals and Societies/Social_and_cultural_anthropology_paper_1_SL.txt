Extract from Skinner, J. 2007. “The Salsa Class: A Complexity of Globalization, Cosmopolitans and
Emotions”, Identities: Global Studies in Culture and Power, 14:485–506.

            Salsa dancing has become a global phenomenon. It emerged from the Latino quarters of
            New York, a mix of Cuban song and Puerto Rican percussion that spread throughout Latin America
            before becoming established as a music and dance genre across the world […]

            There has been a salsa boom, a global phenomenon of music, dancing and merchandise, with
     5      millions of devotees who live for their dancing […] The dance classes in Belfast (Northern Ireland)
            and Hamburg (Germany), are evidence of the globalization of salsa and the commercialization
            of salsa dance and music. Its establishment as an industry throughout the world … relying on
            an international market economy and the needs of a public with time [to spare], a disposable
            income, and seeking activities in which to come together, fulfil their fantasies … and affirm
   10       self-identity […]

            Belfast is a divided and wounded city, torn apart by the decades of armed conflict between
            Protestant Unionist and Catholic Nationalist religious communities which has only
            recently subsided. The city is still sharply segregated in terms of where people live and what
            people do in their leisure time […] The salsa dancers in Belfast constitute a self-defined
   15       “salsa community”. For the majority, salsa dancing is an exotic form of escapism. However, for
            a few Hispanic migrants from Spain and South America, the salsa dance is their chance to recreate
            the night life of their homeland […]

            There is, however, a natural gravitation of dancers to Protestant or Catholic teachers, an informal
            segregation, as dance communities spread by word of mouth through Protestant or Catholic areas.
   20       Dance teachers make use of Protestant or Catholic community centres, thereby putting off members
            of the opposite religious sector of society simply through the difficulty in crossing the religious/
            national divide due to language, accent and name differences […]

            Even if the Protestant and Catholic dancers are on good terms with each other and the dancing
            breaks down stereotypes and barriers, it can still be difficult, or make one feel uncomfortable,
   25       passing through parts of town to reach the dance venue. Despite the success of social integration
            through dance, the dancers are still aware of each others’ backgrounds, and how and from where
            they themselves might be perceived […]

            In Hamburg, Latin Americans attend the salsa nights because they are “living in diaspora*”,
            using salsa to confirm their identity in a foreign context, whether they danced it in the past or not;
   30       salsa becomes an important element of their generalized cultural identity as Latin Americans.
            In contrast the Germans do not identify with the music in the same way. It might be an expressive
            feature of their identity, independence and sexuality but they do not attach themselves to the tales
            of resistance and oppression told within the music. For them, salsa is a passion, an art form and a
            form of entertainment. Salsa, for the Latin Americans, is a cultural place to inhabit.

     35     The salsa groups in Hamburg have very different relationships with salsa. For the Latin Americans,
            salsa provides a link to their homeland. For the Germans, however, the salsa night takes them
            away from home, from their everyday; it is their time for fantasy, escapism, and difference.
            Salsa nights have become occasions for both Latino and non-Latino populations to create and
            perform imagined identities […]

     40     Yet, Germans find it very difficult to give in to the “maleness” of the dance […] Many German
            women … stress their independence, which makes it very awkward for them to accept a
            male’s lead. Instructors have to remind them over and over, “Ladies, follow his lead!” […]

            In Belfast, salsa dancers try to work out the religion of their partner. In Hamburg, by comparison
            this male-led dance, salsa, raises concerns where many are preoccupied with gender equality.

     45     Globalization does not necessarily result in the homogenization of cultural life … The world is
            increasingly interconnected over long distances, and commodities are more standardized and mass
            produced … but their use, reception, and implementation is creative, distinctive and local.

1.     Explain how religion and gender affect the experience of salsa dancers.                                [6 marks]


2.     Explain the relationship between globalization and group identity with reference to
       salsa dancing.                                                                                         [6 marks]


3.     Compare and contrast the identities of salsa dancers with the identities of one
       other group.                                                                                           [8 marks]
