Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   With the aid of at least one diagram, explain the difference between a movement
            along an existing demand curve for a good and a shift of the demand curve
            for a good.                                                                        [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the market forces of demand and supply will always lead
            to the best allocation of resources.                                               [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Aggregate demand consists of consumption, investment, government spending
            and net exports (exports minus imports). Explain two factors that may influence
            consumption and two factors that may influence government spending.                [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the possible impact of an increase in consumption expenditure on the
            performance of an economy.                                                         [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain the possible consequences of an improvement in a country’s terms of
            trade for a country with a current account deficit.                                [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that, in the long term, expenditure-switching policies
            (protectionism) are the most effective way to reduce a current account deficit.    [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the difference between economic growth and economic development,
            and how each of these may be measured.                                             [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the best way that developed countries can help the growth
            and development process of very poor, highly indebted countries is through a
            general cancellation of debts.                                                     [15 marks]
