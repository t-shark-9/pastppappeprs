In addition to the assessment criteria, use the paper-specific markscheme below. Award up to the maximum marks
indicated. Each question is worth [10 marks].

1.       With the aid of a diagram, explain the impact on producers and consumers of a subsidy on a good.

         Candidates may include:
           a definition of a subsidy
           an explanation that a subsidy, by lowering firms’ costs of production, shifts the supply curve downward
           (or to the right), with the vertical difference between the two supply curves representing the subsidy per
           unit of the good
           a correctly labelled supply and demand diagram, showing initial equilibrium price and quantity, and the
           equilibrium price and quantity that result after the supply curve shift
           explanation that the benefits (or incidence) of the subsidy are shared by consumers and producers
           use of the diagram to show that the price paid by consumers for the good falls (relative to the initial
           price), while the price received by firms rises (relative to the initial price)
           an explanation that the difference between the new lower price paid by consumers and the initial price is
           the benefit to consumers (per unit of the good), while the difference between the new higher price
           received by firms and the initial price is the benefit to firms (per unit of the good)
           the benefits for consumers and producers may be shown by correctly drawn rectangles in the diagram,
           indicating the total benefits of the subsidy received by consumers and firms respectively.

         There is no need for the candidate to consider price elasticity of demand (PED) for full marks.

         Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate, should be
         rewarded.

2.       With the aid of at least one diagram, explain one way a consumer might gain from the behaviour of a
         monopolist and one way a consumer might lose from the behaviour of a monopolist.

         Candidates may include:
           a definition of a monopolist
           graphical representation of a monopoly market structure.

         Gains to the consumer:
           economies of scale
           innovation
           use of a diagram to illustrate how the above can lead to gains for the consumer.

         Losses to the consumer:
           compared to a competitive industry, it will charge consumers a higher price
           compared to a competitive industry, it will have a lower level of output
           compared to a competitive industry, it will result in lower consumer surplus
           it will give rise to productive and allocative inefficiency
           use of a diagram to illustrate consumer losses, or productive and allocative inefficiency.

         Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate, should be
      rewarded.

           measures of inflation such as a price index, retail price index, deflator, price deflator
           discussion of basket of goods (regimen), weighting, base year, regional issues (country and city).

            errors in the collection of data
            changes in consumption habits over time
            quality and types of goods and services change over time
            changes in producer prices are excluded
            one-off events such as seasonal variations, oil price shocks
            international comparisons.

4.       With the aid of a diagram, explain how an increase in transfer payments to the poorest households in a
         nation is likely to affect the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient of that nation.

           a definition of transfer payments
           a definition of the Lorenz curve
           a definition of the Gini coefficient
           a diagram illustrating a Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient
           an explanation that an increase in transfer payments to the poorest households can lead to an
           improvement in income distribution, by increasing the incomes of lower income groups
           an explanation that an improvement in income distribution will cause the Lorenz curve to move towards
           the line of absolute equality
           an explanation that the Gini coefficient (index) will become lower indicating a more equitable distribution
           of income.

           a definition of a fixed exchange rate
           a definition of a floating (flexible) exchange rate.
           Explanation of the difference between a fixed exchange rate and a floating (flexible) exchange rate in
           terms of how they function:
           – explanation of how a fixed exchange rate is maintained at a fixed level: buying and selling by the
              government of a country of its domestic currency in the foreign exchange market
           – explanation of the factors causing variations of a floating (flexible) exchange rate: changes in the
              demand for and supply of a currency resulting from changes in trade flows, international interest rate
              differentials, international price level differentials and speculation.

         full marks.

         Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate, should be

           basis of growth, while an inward-oriented growth strategy relies on protection and increased
           self-reliance
           an explanation that outward-oriented growth strategies are based on free trade whereas inward-oriented
           growth strategies are based on import substitution
           an explanation that outward-oriented growth strategies are based on market liberalization whereas
           inward-oriented growth strategies based on government intervention to regulate domestic industries and
           protect infant industries
           an explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of outward-oriented growth strategies and
           inward-oriented growth strategies.
