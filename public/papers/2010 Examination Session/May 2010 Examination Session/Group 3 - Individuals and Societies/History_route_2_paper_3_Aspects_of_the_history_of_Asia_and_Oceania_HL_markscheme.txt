Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
         detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
         are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is
        limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
        but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth, historical
        knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in
        nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
        commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
        an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either
        chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
        generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
        and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
        top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth
        knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to
        indicate some in-depth understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are
        placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
        comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present, but not always consistently
        integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
        knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
        such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
        interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
        balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
        commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
        may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
        may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
        present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
        contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
        well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Compare and contrast the colonial systems of two states in Southeast Asia from the
     late-eighteenth century up until the mid-nineteenth century.

     Candidates should identify what they consider to be the main features of the colonial systems of the
     two states chosen. These named examples could be British, French, Spanish or Dutch colonies.
     The response may include; the political structure; the type of rule, direct or indirect; the structure of
     the bureaucracy; the economy, including land distribution; the relationships between the colonial
     rulers and the indigenous people; the way the colonial power may have handled rebellions and
     resistance; the lifestyles of the colonial masters and the presence and activities of missionaries.
     Answers may focus on comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified.

     If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


2.   Analyse the nature of the British presence in one of the following from the late-eighteenth
     century to the mid-nineteenth century: Australia; New Zealand; India.

     Candidates will describe the nature of the British presence in one country: Australia, New Zealand
     or India, and in the process they should identify what they consider to be the main features. For
     Australia or New Zealand these may include: the claiming of the land for the British Crown; the
     reasons why the different colonies were established; settlement schemes; the manner in which each
     colony was governed; land distribution; trade and commerce; official policies towards the
     indigenous people; relationships between the settlers and the indigenous people; the level of
     violence used to control the indigenous people; the activities of missionaries; immigration,
     particularly in the 1830s and 1840s; the lifestyles of the settlers; the attempt to replicate British
     society and institutions; granting of responsible government in the mid-nineteenth century. For
     Australia: there were six colonies established, each for different reasons; South Australia was the
     only one free of convict transportation; there were no formal treaties with the indigenous people.
     For New Zealand: it was initially considered part of New South Wales until 1841; the 1840 Treaty
     of Waitangi was a formal treaty with the Maoris.

     For India the British presence took a different form because it was basically the operations of the
     East India Company rather than a colonial settlement. The causes of the 1857 Great Revolt (Indian
     Mutiny) may well be considered, however the focus should be the nature of rule prior to this.
     Candidates will no doubt refer to differing polices of various Governor Generals: Wellesley created
     subsidiary alliances with the princes; Bentinck’s “reforms” included the abolition of sati and
     thuggee, marriage reform and the extension of education; Dalhousie introduced the Doctrine of
     Lapse which annexed the princely states without heirs. The economic changes such as the opening
     of India to free trade had a negative impact on native industry and production; land reform and land
     taxation also caused difficulties for Indian peasants. British policies could all be considered as
     being aimed at extending and consolidating British control and trade.

3.   Analyse the causes and consequences of the Taiping (Taip’ing) Rebellion in China.

     This will probably be a popular question and should be reasonably straightforward. Candidates
     should set the scene in China in the mid-nineteenth century following China’s defeat in the First
     Opium War and the 1842 Treaty of Nanjing (Nanking). The widespread discontent in China at this
     time made rebellion a distinct possibility and the causes include: the economic and social problems
     of China; growing population pressure; the land problem; rising prices; the situation of the
     peasantry; political causes such as the inefficient government; the unpopularity of the Qing
     (Ch’-ing) government; official corruption and incompetence; natural disasters; the effects of the
     Opium War and the unequal treaties; national humiliation. The leadership of Hong Xiuquan
     (Hung Hsiu-ch’uan) and his new ideas appealed to many people, particularly Hakka peasants and
     workers. These ideas included a version of Christianity; land redistribution and the abolition of
     private ownership; mutual sharing of resources; gender equality; banning of opium. The military
     weakness of the Manchu rulers made rebellion more likely. References may be made to the
     immediate causes of the rebellion: events in Guangxi (Kwangsi); the capture of Nanjing (Nanking)
     and the founding of the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace. Candidates should avoid a narrative of
     the Taiping (Taip’ing) Rebellion itself and Hong Xiuquan’s (Hung Hsiu-ch’uan’s) government and
     rule. This rebellion, from 1850 to 1864, was the most serious faced by the dynasty and its
     consequences were severe and cost the lives of about 30 million people as well as widespread
     destruction. The consequences for the Taipings (Taip’ings) included: the internal dissension that
     developed; the hypocrisy in the lifestyles of the leaders; strategic blunders; the inability to appeal to
     the mandarin class due to the ideological conflict between Confucianism and Christianity; poor
     diplomacy with the Western powers; the eventual decision by the Western powers to support the
     Qing (Ch’ing) rather than the rebels. Consequences for China in general include: the emergence of
     new provincial Han leaders such as Zeng Guofan (Tseng Kuo-fan) and Li Hongzhang
     (Li Hung-chang) and their provincial armies; the Tongzhi (T’ung-chih) restoration of Confucian
     government; the rise of the Self-Strengthening Movement and reforms. Expect reference to the
     weakening of the Manchu dynasty and how many believed that only major reform might save it.
     Other consequences were hostility to foreigners after the links with Christianity in the movement,
     the part played by some foreign powers in the rebellion, and, the decision by the Western powers to
     support the Qing (Ch’ing) rather than the rebels.

     If only causes or consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

4.   Examine whether the isolation of Tokugawa Japan caused internal changes that weakened the
     Shogunate’s rule in the period from the late-eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century.

     Candidates may discuss the nature of the isolation policy (shakoku) of the Tokugawa Shogunate and
     should show awareness of the internal changes in Japanese society after the long period of peace.
     Expect reference to the changing social and economic status of the merchants and the samurai;
     currency changes; the increase in peasant rebellions; the floating world and the counter culture.
     The Japanese had contact with Europe only through the Dutch trading factory at Deshima in
     Nagasaki harbour. By the nineteenth century this contact had prompted the rise of Dutch Learning
     (rangaku) amongst the samurai and an awareness that scientific and technological developments in
     the West posed a challenge to Japan. The social and economic changes had weakened the
     traditional feudal structures which supported the Tokugawa Shogunate and the National Learning
     (kokgaku) school of thought called for a restoration of the Emperor. Also increasing pressure came
     from Western powers, particularly Britain, Russia and the United States for trade and some of the
     tozama clans already had some limited trade with them. Mention of the arrival of Commodore
     Perry and the opening of Japan to the West are relevant only in the context of an analysis of the
     weakness of the Shogunate’s rule.


5.   For what reasons, and with what consequences, was the All India Muslim League created in 1906?

     Candidates will need to see the creation of the All India Muslim League in the context of British
     rule in India and Muslims as a minority group. The 1858 Government of India Act gave Britain
     direct control over India with the major constitutional changes. In the late nineteenth century an
     Indian nationalist movement developed with the Indian National Congress being founded in 1885.
     The Congress made no conscious efforts to enlist the Muslim community in its struggle for a more
     equitable share in government. Muslims were a minority in Congress and many Muslims felt that
     the Hindu majority would not represent their interests. Also the British administration did not
     always acknowledge Muslim concerns with regard to their religion, language and culture. This led
     to Muslim fears that a Hindu majority would seek to suppress Muslim culture and religion in an
     independent India. The 1905 partition of Bengal, which created a Muslim majority state, was the
     catalyst for the emergence of the All India Muslim League in 1906. The Hindu reaction to this
     seemed to confirm Muslim fears. A delegation of Muslim leaders to the Viceroy, Minto, requested
     separate electorates for Muslims if the British reformed the political system. Minto’s sympathetic
     response led to the creation of the League in order to maintain the political pressure. Initially, its
     goals focussed on representing Muslim issues within the existing structure rather than the formation
     of an independent state. The consequences could cover a range of events and polices:
     Morley–Minto reforms of 1909 which allowed for separate electorates and reserved seats for
     Muslims; 1916 Lucknow Pact with Congress; Gandhi and the Khilafat issue; Jinnah’s failure to
     form a Hindu-Muslim alliance; Iqbal’s Two Nation Theory; 1929 Nehru Report; the souring of
     relations between Congress and the League. The scope of this question does not require candidates
     to go beyond the 1920s. Both parts of the question should be addressed.
                                                  –7–            M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M++


6.   How important was the First World War in the growth of national identity in either Australia
     or New Zealand?

     Candidates may choose initially to identify what they consider to be the emerging sense of national
     identity in Australia or New Zealand before the First World War. In Australia: the movement
     towards and the achievement of Federation; the celebration of Australia’s uniqueness with reference
     to the flora and fauna; the adoption of the bushman image despite the fact that most people lived in
     towns and cities; the art and writing of this period; the different strands of nationalism, radical
     republicanism and dual loyalty to both Australia and the British Empire. In New Zealand a similar
     set of factors and sentiments prevailed: involvement in the Boer War; granting of Dominion status
     in 1907; the rugged and enterprising man alone versus nature; egalitarianism; double patriotism;
     cultural nationalists. The impact of Australia’s or New Zealand’s involvement in the First World
     War may then be discussed. For both: the initial enthusiasm for the war; the idea that Gallipoli was
     a defining moment in nationhood, for Australia “Baptism by fire” and New Zealand “Baptism of
     blood”; the soldiers come to represent the typical Australian or New Zealander in uniform with his
     values of resourcefulness and mateship; war correspondents and cartoonists popularized this image.
     Despite the fact that the Gallipoli campaign ended in withdrawal, the Anzac legend came to
     symbolize Australia’s or New Zealand’s involvement in the First World War and subsequent wars
     and Anzac Day became a public holiday and de facto national day. The aftermath of the war may
     be discussed. In both countries the sense of national identity is now linked with commemoration
     and remembrance and it becomes part of a conservative imperialist nationalism in the 1920s; an
     example of this is the establishment of returned servicemen’s associations who become the keepers
     of the legend.


7.   Why did Japan annex Korea in 1910?

     Candidates may initially establish that Japan, during the Meiji period (1868–1912), was rapidly
     industrializing and modernizing. Early in this period the Japanese government was interested in
     Korea as a possible future possession: in order to emulate the imperialist nature of the Western
     powers; as a source of raw materials; as a steady market for Japanese exports; as a “granary” to feed
     the rising Japanese population; for protection from an expanding Russia; for strategic advantages in
     dealing with both Russia and China. Japan forced Korea to open its ports in 1876 with the Treaty of
     Kanhwa. Japan recognized Korea as an independent state, but Korea still considered itself to be
     under Chinese control. The Treaty of Shimonoseki after the Sino–Japanese War (1894–1895)
     forced China to recognize Korea’s independence and also gave Japan more trading ports in Korea.
     Japan began to dominate the internal politics of Korea. The Japanese murdered Empress Min who
     sought Russian help. The Treaty of Portsmouth following the Russo–Japanese War (1904–1905)
     recognized Japan’s political, economic and military interests in Korea. Finally, Japan formally
     annexed Korea in 1910.
                                                 –8–           M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M++


8.   Compare and contrast the Self-Strengthening Movement in China (1861–1894) and the
     reforms under the Meiji Restoration in Japan (1868–1894).

     The question requires candidates to analyse economic and military modernization, as well as the
     degree of social and political change in both China and Japan. Expect reference to the
     philosophical aims of both reform movements; to the different systems of government; to the
     underlying cultural attitudes that influenced the impact of modernization upon each society and to
     the nature of the actual reforms. Candidates may note that in Japan a political revolution occurred
     producing a new and dynamic leadership capable of sweeping reform on a national level, whereas
     China’s government was reluctant to embrace change and unable to promote a sense of national
     unity. For China candidates may discuss: the Tongzhi (T’ung-chih) Restoration of Confucian
     government; the concept of self-strengthening; the weakness and conservatism of the central
     government; Cixi’s (Tz’u-hsi’s) power; roles of Zeng Guofan (Tseng Kuo-fan), Li Hongzhang
     (Li Hung-chang), Zuo Zongtang (Tso Tsung-t’ang) and Prince Gong (Kung); the success or failure
     of the various reforms undertaken. For Japan: the Meiji Restoration, the Regency and Imperial rule;
     “Western science and Eastern ethics”; Shintoism, Confucianism and Buddhism; readiness for
     reform; the Constitutions of 1868 and 1889; political, cultural, economic, military and social
     change. Candidates may cite the Sino–Japanese War (1894–1895) as evidence of Japanese success
     and Chinese failure. Many answers will focus on contrasts, but comparisons should also be
     identified.

     If only China or Japan is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                   –9–             M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M++


9.   “We will either have a divided India or a destroyed India.” Discuss the role of Jinnah and the
     creation of an independent Pakistan in light of this statement.

     The role of Jinnah is of great importance in the creation of an independent Pakistan state. Candidates
     will know about his life and political career and they should put it into the context of the events in
     India at the time. Jinnah was initially an active member of the Indian National Congress as well as
     joining the All India Muslim League in 1913. He was a supporter of inclusive Indian nationalism, but
     in the 1920s he moved away from that position. The 1928 Nehru Report did not endorse the
     continuation of separate Muslim electorates and it fuelled Muslim fears about Hindu domination.
     During the late 1920s and early 1930s the relationship between Hindus and Muslims deteriorated.
     In 1930 the President of the League, Iqbal, proposed the idea of a separate Muslim state and his Two
     Nation Theory gained support. Jinnah became disillusioned with politics and left India to practice law
     in Britain. He returned in 1935 to lead the League.

     The significance of other factors which also contributed to partition will need to be discussed. These
     may include: the Government of India Act 1935 and those for and against; the role of Congress and
     Nehru; the role of Jinnah and the revival of the All India Muslim League and the impact of the
     Second World War. The League’s Lahore Resolution was adopted in 1940, and its principles formed
     the foundation for Pakistan’s first constitution. During the Cripps mission in 1942, Jinnah demanded
     parity between the number of Congress and League ministers, the League’s exclusive right to appoint
     Muslims and a right for Muslim-majority provinces to secede, leading to the breakdown of talks.
     Jinnah supported the British effort in the Second World War, and opposed the Indian National
     Congress’ Quit India Movement. Gandhi’s vision of an inclusive and united India may be mentioned.
     Talks between Jinnah and Gandhi in 1944 failed to achieve agreement. This was the last attempt to
     reach a single-state solution.

     The quotation comes from Jinnah’s speech in July 1946, shortly before his “direct action” to force the
     British to concede his demand for a separate Muslim homeland. Candidates will also describe and
     explain Jinnah’s attitude towards constitutionalism and the launching of “direct action” if a separate
     Pakistan was not granted. The ethnic killing and increased communal violence has been blamed on
     Jinnah – the “destroyed India”. Candidates may evaluate the Two Nation Theory and the importance
     of Jinnah’s role in this context in the creation of an independent Pakistan, but should also consider the
     responsibility of the divided India and the chaos and killing, which resulted from this.
                                                  – 10 –          M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M++


10.   Examine the impact of the Japanese occupation on either Korea or China between 1910 and 1945.

      Candidates will probably have strong views, but expect an attempt to produce a balanced
      assessment.

      Korea was subordinated to Japanese interests and its language and culture were suppressed. Raw
      materials and rice were exported to Japan in return for Japanese manufactures. Japanese rule was
      resented and resisted, as demonstrated by the March First Movement of 1919, which was ruthlessly
      crushed. During the 1920s, however, Japanese rule was relatively benign. Japanese investment in
      Korea improved communications, industry expanded and the infrastructure of a modern economy
      was created. There was a high level of education in Japanese and a skilled workforce developed.
      Japanese rule became harsher during the 1930s. The desire for independence remained, but the
      Koreans had little choice but to cooperate until the Japanese defeat in 1945 ended Japanese rule.

      China could claim that she had been occupied by the Japanese prior to the outbreak of the First
      World War and then in 1919, lost some of her territories to the Japanese at the Paris Peace
      Settlement. Shandong (Shantung) was effectively a Japanese concession after the 21 Demands
      (1915) and economically, Japan was given rights in Manchuria and Eastern Mongolia. From 1931,
      Manchuria was occupied and in 1937 following the Japanese attack on China, large parts of the
      stern seaboard and some of the hinterland was occupied by Japan until 1945. Like the Koreans, the
      Chinese bitterly resented Japanese rule although the Nationalists did little to prevent it. Candidates
      will probably note the creation of Manchukuo (1931–1933), the attack in 1937 and the massacre in
      Nanjing (Nanking). There should be some discussion of the Sino–Japanese War (1937–1945) and
      its impact on China including the struggle between the Guomindang (Kuomintang) and the Chinese
      Communist Party.
                                                  – 11 –          M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M++


11.   To what extent was the May Fourth Movement (1919) significant in determining the future of
      China?

      The events following the 1911 Revolution saw the establishment of the Republic followed by its
      betrayal by Yuan Shikai (Yuan Shih-k’ai). This was a change of regime, but not a change in political
      culture. The 1919 May Fourth Movement saw a new type of political activism and gave its name to
      an intellectual, cultural and political movement, which lasted into the 1920s and beyond. Politically,
      expect reference to student demonstrations, opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, the impact of the
      Russian Revolution and Communist ideology, the creation of the Chinese Communist Party and Sun’s
      reform of the Guomindang (Kuomintang). Intellectually, “destroying the past” included the rejection
      of Confucianism, the debate between science and metaphysics, the vernacular language movement
      and the emergence of writers like Lu Xun (Lu Hsun). Candidates will need to analyse some of the
      ideas embodied in the May Fourth Movement in order to fully answer the question. The May Fourth
      Movement was a part of the wider New Culture Movement, an intellectual revolution and literary
      revival which promoted the publication of magazines in the everyday language and characters.
      It favoured Western ideas such as an emphasis on youth, liberalism and socialism and it criticized
      China’s traditional society and Confucian values. The May Fourth Movement was also
      anti-imperialist, patriotic, favoured student and worker involvement in politics and the establishment
      of unions. Candidates must address “the past” in their evaluation. Some may argue that the act of
      creating a republic may not have had the immediate effects in “constructing the future” that had been
      hoped, but that the foundations had been laid for what was to follow. Others may see the real
      renaissance of China as stemming from the events of the May Fourth movement in 1919 and the
      intellectual and cultural renaissance it came to represent. Some candidates may argue that traditional
      Chinese values and society were destroyed and Western political ideas dominated without much
      constructive gain. Other candidates may argue that the future directions of China were set by the May
      Fourth Movement. Give credit to candidates who trace the significance forward, and expect
      evaluation in the context of developments in China as far as at least the 1930s. Some candidates may
      go as far as 1949 so credit relevant analysis and comment.

12.   To what extent did Jiang Jieshi’s (Chiang Kai-shek’s) government address the problems
      facing China in the period between 1927 and 1937?

      Candidates should look at the period of rule of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) from the end of the
      1927 Northern Expedition until the beginning of the Second United Front and the start of the
      Sino–Japanese War in 1937. Features of his rule include: appeal to nationalism; justification of his
      rule in terms of Sun Yixian’s (Sun Yat-sen’s) principles; single-party/leader with no significant
      move towards democracy; reliance on the military; attempt to create a mass movement and
      ideological control. Candidates may also identify the problems facing China: the need for financial
      and economic reform; tariff autonomy; the recovery of foreign concessions; communications;
      industrial development; education; the need for social reform; the plight of the peasants. Significant
      gains were made in the areas of foreign diplomacy, international recognition, the revision of the
      treaty system and the return of foreign concessions. There were developments in industry and
      communications and some attempt to reform aspects of life in China with the 1934 New Life
      Movement. The injustices of the peasants were not addressed and the government looked after the
      interests of industrialists and land-owners. Oppression was endemic and Jiang created the
      fascist-like organization, the Blue Shirts. He purged the Communists in the 1927 Shanghai
      Massacre and ended the First United Front. His aim was to unify China and thus the bandit
      extermination campaign against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) between 1930 and 1934.
      Jiang never controlled much more than one third of China or two thirds of her population because
      warlordism was never fully subdued. Jiang seemed more intent on eliminating challenges to his
      rule than dealing with the threat of Japanese invasion. This eventually led to the 1936 Xian (Sian)
      incident where his own officers kidnapped him and insisted on the creation of the Second United
      Front to fight the Japanese. Generally, Jiang’s government is characterized by administrative
      inefficiency, corruption, fiscal irresponsibility and self-seeking rule; but some students may
      challenge this interpretation.


13.   Evaluate the claim that the rise of militarism and nationalism in Japan in the early 1930s was
      essentially a reaction against Western influence and modernization.

      Post-Depression Japan saw the failure of the political parties to handle the effects of the Depression
      and to withstand the demands of the extreme nationalists and militarists. Candidates may well
      agree with the statement in the title, but should also recognize that elements in Japanese traditional
      society and culture encouraged militarism and supported expansionism. Nevertheless, Japanese
      political and military leaders were very sensitive to Western attitudes as they attempted to achieve
      great power status and acceptance as equals by the West. Post-Versailles, the Japanese resented
      their treatment as well as the decisions made at the 1922 Washington Naval agreement. Elements
      in Japan were easily offended by real and imagined slights to Japan’s international status and
      honour, believed that Western attitudes were often hypocritical as well as hostile to Japan’s national
      interests and were attracted to and found justification for their actions in the rise of fascism in
      Europe. For very good candidates expect detailed knowledge and an assessment of examples of
      Western influence and modernization in Japan as well as an evaluation of the statement in the title.
      Candidates will also recognize that Japan in the 1930s faced severe economic and social problems
      for which militarism appeared to provide a solution which weak and corrupt civilian politicians
      were unable to address. It also gave rise to ultra-nationalism rooted in traditional Japanese culture.

      If only militarism or nationalism is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

14.   Assess the reasons for the breakdown of relations between Japan and the United States in the
      late 1930s that eventually resulted in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

      Most candidates will comment on the Pacific rivalry between the two countries. On the one hand
      the Japanese were exploiting Southeast Asia’s raw materials and markets while the Americans were
      trying to persuade the Japanese of the possible consequences of this action. The Japanese resented
      decisions made at the Washington Naval Conference (1921–1922) which limited the Japanese naval
      fleet. They had steadily increased their sphere of influence in the region and in 1940 announced
      plans for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Japanese resented the United States’
      restricted immigration laws and their trade embargo. Japan also signed the Tripartite Pact with the
      Axis powers in September 1940. Japan’s invasion of China in 1937 and her conquest of Southeast
      Asia in 1940–1941 put great pressure on the United States to act. However, initially President
      Roosevelt increased the US military presence in the Pacific and brought in the nation’s first
      peacetime draft. Candidates may debate the issue of whether Japan was provoked to attack Pearl
      Harbor or whether the US government deliberately allowed the attack so that the US could enter the
      Second World War on the side of the Allies.


15.   What was the impact on the region when Great Britain joined the European Union (EU) in 1973?

      Responses to this question may initially acknowledge the changed status of Britain in the region as
      a whole after the Second World War. In the case of Australia and New Zealand candidates may
      note that the Second World War caused these countries to realize that they could not depend on
      Britain for defence. This led to the ANZUS pact with the United States and Australia providing for
      mutual defence. The rise of communism in Asia presented another perceived threat and again
      Australia and New Zealand joined with others in order to meet it, this time entering the South East
      Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). These agreements assumed a policy of forward defence so that
      both countries sent forces to fight communist insurgents in Malaya, Korea, Borneo and Vietnam.
      Candidates may also note that independence from Britain was granted, in the period from 1947 to
      the 1970s to countries in the Indian sub-continent, Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Therefore,
      Britain’s withdrawal of a military presence from east of Suez in 1971 continued the trend of moving
      away from reliance on Britain. Britain’s entry into the European Union in 1973 reduced the access
      of former British colonies and dominions in the region to British trade and markets. This caused
      Australia and New Zealand to turn to East and South East Asia as economic partners particularly
      with China. Australia and New Zealand played a significant role in the Colombo Plan, which
      provided developing nations in the region with aid and expertise. Despite these economic shifts,
      membership of the British Commonwealth remained significant to most former British colonies and
      dominions in the region. Some candidates may discuss the fact that the British had continued to
      invest in economic developments in Hong Kong and that they did not politically withdraw from
      Hong Kong until 1997.

      Overall, the consequences of Britain joining the European Union and the extent to which this forced
      a change of loyalties and priorities amongst the countries in the region is one which candidates need
      to address.

16.   Evaluate the policies of either the governments of Australia since 1945 in dealing with
      aboriginals or the governments of New Zealand since 1945 in dealing with Maoris and
      other minorities.

      The main changes in attitude occurred after the Second World War and then only gradually.
      Until the 1930s the approach of all the state governments was one of “protection” whereby most
      aboriginal people were confined to missions and reserves, largely isolated from white settlement
      and were regarded as wards of the state. From the 1920s to the 1970s all the state governments
      pursued the policy of removing mixed race children from their families and placing them in
      institutions before being assigned to work in menial jobs. They became known as the “Stolen
      Generation”. During the 1940s and after the Second World War the policy of “assimilation” was
      adopted, whereby aboriginal people would submit to indoctrination in white ways before taking
      their place in the general Australian community. For much of their history, Australia’s major
      parties did not perceive a need to have “aboriginal affairs” policies, but this altered in the 1960s and
      1970s as the aboriginal interest came to occupy a more prominent position. For a time,
      “integration” became a policy of the governments and, as attitudes changed, state governments
      began to amend many of the laws that denied aboriginal people equality with whites; though it was
      hard to identify the distinction between “assimilation” and “integration”. In 1967, all parties
      supported the proposed Constitutional amendment which was passed in a referendum. This gave
      the federal government the right to pass laws for the welfare of the aboriginal people and to count
      them in the census as Australians. As racial perceptions changed, assisted by the emergence of
      some aboriginals into public view as artists, athletes and public figures, and as an aboriginal
      movement developed, legislation placing them in a position of equality was enacted. This brought
      further problems of adjustment on both sides and the situation is complex. Relevant legislation may
      be state or federal and developments may have occurred at a different pace in different areas. The
      Labour Party under Whitlam made the most positive pitch for these interests. In 1975 they passed
      the Aboriginal Land Rights Act to restore land to indigenous people. In 1992 legislation was
      enacted to recognize native land claims and in 1998 a National Sorry Day was introduced to
      acknowledge the wrongs done to the Stolen Generation. On 13 February 2008 the new Labour
      prime minister, Kevin Rudd, formally apologized in parliament to the Stolen Generation.

      In New Zealand after the Second World War there were significant demographic and cultural
      changes that impacted upon successive governments’ policies. Prior to the war Maoris had largely
      been confined to rural areas from whence they derived their identity. European New Zealanders
      believed that they had the best race relations in the world due to the Treaty of Waitangi which had
      been signed in 1840. During the war there had been a number of Maori officers who later moved
      into Maori-related posts in the Public Service. The Labour government passed the Maori Social and
      Economic Advancement Act in 1945 which allowed for the establishment of local tribal committees
      and indigenous welfare officers to work in urban areas. After the war there had been widespread
      Maori migration to the cities. This, along with the migration of Pacific Islanders to New Zealand,
      created ghettos of poverty and discrimination. Urbanization led to the need for Maoris to redefine
      their cultural identity. The Hunn Report of 1960 led to the establishment of the Maori Education
      Council which extended Maori educational opportunities and also helped the young adapt to city
      life. In 1962 the Maori Welfare Act was passed and this set up the New Zealand Maori Council, a
      pan-tribal organization. Maori land rights became an issue in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1977 the
      Waitangi Tribunal was established with the aim of monitoring any legislation, policy or practice
      that may have been considered a violation of the Treaty of Waitangi and in 1985 its jurisdiction was
      extended back to 1840. In 1993 a Mixed Member Proportional system of government was
      introduced.

      Award credit where candidates support their opinions with evidence.

17.   Compare and contrast the political, social and economic developments of two of the following
      states in South and Southeast Asia in the second half of the twentieth century: the Philippines;
      Malaysia; Singapore; Indonesia; Sri Lanka; Burma.

      This is intentionally a broad question and candidates may choose any two states of the region from
      those given. Candidates’ responses will need to have a balance between the political, social and
      economic developments of their chosen states. Expect reasoned and balanced discussion based on
      evidence and knowledge.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


18.   Analyse the controversial role of either Zulfikar Bhutto in Pakistan or Indira Gandhi in India.

      Candidates will need to address the issue of why Zulfikar Bhutto is a controversial figure as they
      evaluate his political career. Bhutto was in power between 1971 and 1977. He was the founder of
      the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), the largest and most influential political party in Pakistan. In
      1962, he was appointed Pakistan’s foreign minister and he significantly transformed Pakistan’s
      hitherto pro-Western foreign policy. Bhutto began asserting a foreign policy course for Pakistan
      that was independent of US influence. Bhutto made Pakistan an influential member in non-aligned
      organizations. While he was hailed for being a nationalist, Bhutto was roundly criticized for
      opportunism and intimidating his political opponents. He gave Pakistan its third constitution,
      oversaw Pakistan’s nuclear programme and held peace talks with neighbouring India. His socialist
      policies are blamed for slowing down Pakistan’s economic progress owing to poor productivity and
      high costs. Bhutto is also criticized for human rights abuses perpetrated by the army. Many in
      Pakistan’s military condemned Bhutto for having caused the crisis that caused the Bangladesh
      Liberation War by not accepting the outcome of the democratic elections in 1971. In 1977 the
      military, led by General Zia, staged a coup and relieved Bhutto of power. He was executed in 1979
      for authorizing the murder of a political opponent. In spite of all the criticism Bhutto still remains a
      popular leader of the country.

      Candidates will need to address the issue of why Indira Gandhi is a controversial figure as they
      evaluate her political career. She was prime minister of India for three consecutive terms between
      1966 and 1977 and for a fourth term in 1980 until her assassination in 1984. The issues to be
      considered include: the implementation of the State of Emergency in 1975; other policies such as
      population control and the forced sterilization programme which were disliked because of their
      authoritarian nature. Indira Gandhi’s support of her son, Sanjay, led to accusations of nepotism and
      corruption. Intervention in the Bangladesh conflict in 1971 was generally considered to be
      successful in containing a potential refugee crisis. Her economic policies initially were a
      continuation of Nehru’s. She introduced left-wing economic policies and promoted agricultural
      productivity, but by the mid-1970s India was facing an economic crisis and her popularity was
      declining. Her most controversial measure was the State of Emergency and analysis will no doubt
      consider whether it was necessary or whether it was a non-democratic measure to enable her to
      retain power. In June 1984 she authorized the Indian army to forcibly enter the Sikh sacred Golden
      Temple to arrest insurgents. She was assassinated in 1984 by a disgruntled Sikh.

19.   “An absolute monster or a great visionary – or both.” Discuss this assessment of Mao Zedong
      (Mao Tse-tung) in the period from 1949 until his death in 1976.

      This is intentionally a broad question and candidates will have to cover a lot of material in their
      responses. Candidates’ responses will need to have a balance between the negative “monster” and
      the positive “great visionary” and provide an evaluation of the accuracy of these in their assessment
      of Mao Zedong’s (Mao Tse-tung’s) rule in China over more than 25 years. Candidates will need to
      evaluate both his achievements and his failures. Expect candidates to discuss Mao’s policies,
      campaigns and plans: through the New China reconstruction period, the First Five Year Plan, the
      100 Flowers and Anti-Rightist Campaigns, the Great Leap Forward, the Socialist Education
      Movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, but also expect a critical appraisal of
      Mao’s role. Candidates may also discuss his role in relation to other leaders such as Lin Biao (Lin Piao),
      Liu Shaoqi (Liu Shao-ch’i), Deng Xiaoping (Teng Hsiao-p’ing), Zhou Enlai (Chou En-lai), Peng
      Dehuai (P’eng Te-huai) and Jiang Qing (Chiang Ch’ing).

      Foreign policy can come into this too and Mao’s rapprochement with the USA later in his life.
      Candidates may recognize that Mao continued to assert an influence after his death in that his
      legacy and the cult that had surrounded him could not immediately be ignored. Expect reasoned
      balanced discussion based on evidence and knowledge and reward originality and an evaluation
      based on the key terms in the question.


20.   For what reasons, and with what results until 1976, did relations between China and the
      Soviet Union break down in the late 1950s?

      Expect candidates to place this in the context of the Cold War with better candidates realizing that
      each power had national interests and priorities, which changed over time, most importantly with
      regard to their own relationships with the United States. The Chinese and the Soviets may have
      appeared natural allies early in the relationship and the Korean War cemented their relationship
      against the West with the United States regarding China as acting as an ally of the Soviet Union,
      blocking its entry into the United Nations and supporting the Nationalist regime on Taiwan as
      the true government of China. Initially, this encouraged the Chinese and Soviets to become closer,
      but the actual conduct of the Korean War and nuclear issues helped to divide them. Before the end
      of the decade, ideological differences between the Soviet Union and China led to worsening
      relations between them following the destalinization speech in 1956. The split in the international
      Communist movement grew worse in the 1960s. The impact this had in Sino–Soviet relations came
      to involve the USA, involved in Vietnam, who continued to regard China as opposing its policies
      and providing assistance to the Vietnamese. The growing tension between China and the Soviet
      Union marked by a Soviet military build-up on its borders with China in the late 1960s led to a
      change in Chinese foreign policy. Both China and the United States saw advantages in
      reconciliation, marked by President Nixon’s visit to China in 1972 (followed soon after by that of
      Tanaka of Japan). The United States established mutually beneficial trade links (as did Japan) and
      the Soviet Union’s strategic position was weakened. Tensions did not disappear, but the emergence
      of a different approach to foreign policy was evident with the acceptance of the People’s Republic
      of China into the United Nations in 1971. Expect reasoned and balanced discussion based on
      evidence and knowledge.

21.   Explain how the Korean peninsula was divided by 1953, and what the consequences were for
      the Korean people and the region until 1960.

      The Cold War had begun when the Korean War broke out in 1950. Following the Yalta
      agreements, Korea had been temporarily divided along the 38th Parallel, but the emerging Cold
      War saw the declaration of two Korean states in 1948, Communist North and a non-Communist
      South, both of which sought unification on their terms. The Communists came to power in China
      the following year, and the United States was still formulating its policy towards the People’s
      Republic of China and the defeated Nationalists on Taiwan. The North Korean invasion of the
      South in June 1950 changed all that. A vote in the United Nations Security Council authorized UN
      intervention, and US forces, joined by those of other non-Communist powers, entered the conflict,
      stemming the tide and pursuing the North Koreans towards the Yalu River border with China.
      Chinese “volunteers” drove the UN forces back to the 38th parallel where the war stalemated until a
      ceasefire in 1953. The effects were profound. For the Korean people it was a total war. Casualties
      were in the millions and the country was devastated and occupied. North Korea became a bastion
      of communism under Kim II Sung and allied with the Chinese and the Soviets to remain a
      repressive regime until today. South Korea became the Republic of Korea and an American ally
      and it began a process of democratic reform and economic development. But the Cold War
      remained in place and an armed truce was the best term to describe the situation on the Korean
      peninsula between the Communist Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of
      Korea. For the region, Chinese success in the war raised their international prestige among non-
      aligned countries and indicated to the world that China was a significant power. However, the
      People’s Republic of China was unrecognized by the US and its allies for the next 20 years. US
      policy became the containment of China and communism and hence US involvement in Vietnam
      and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

      US policy towards Japan changed and it became a base for the US effort in Korea. Industry was
      revived and the “reverse course” restored conservatives to power. The occupation ended in 1951
      and the Security Agreement tied Japan to the United States. Candidates should mention the
      Communist threat elsewhere in Asia and the development of containment policy in Vietnam.
      Award some credit if the Korean War itself is the entire focus of the answer, although candidates
      need to mention the effects of the war upon the Korean peninsula and the region.

22.   Discuss the importance of globalization in creating economic, cultural and social change in
      one country of the region during the second half of the twentieth century.

      Candidates may choose any country of the region. Globalization is a term that came into popular
      usage in the 1980s to describe the increased movement of people, knowledge, ideas, goods and
      money across national borders, which has led to increasing interconnectedness among the world’s
      populations. It is the tendency for markets to become global rather than national, as barriers to
      international trade (e.g. tariffs) are reduced and international transport and communications
      improve, and with the tendency for large multinational companies to grow to service global
      markets. Candidates should offer some definition or show understanding of the term in the context
      of the question. The way in which it has created economic, cultural and social change in the chosen
      country needs to be addressed. These could include: the creation of more employment or the loss of
      jobs; the impact on working conditions and pay; the effects of multinational companies;
      a uniformity of products available; the creation of consumer markets; the globalization of popular
      culture and the youth culture; changes in the roles and status of women; the impact on the
      institution of the family; changing levels of education; the impact on sport and leisure pursuits; the
      impact on religious observance and values. Candidates may have different views as to the extent
      and desirability of change, but should produce an argument based upon analysis and factual
      evidence relating to the country chosen.

23.   Evaluate the importance of religion in the social and economic development of one country of
      the region between 1945 and 2000.

      Candidates need to consider the importance of religion along with other developments in the
      country of their choice.

      Popular choices will probably be Indonesia and Burma, but reward any appropriate choice of
      country. Burma achieved independence in 1948 and factional rivalry leading to violence was
      prevalent in Burmese politics causing Ne Win to seize power in 1962 and set up a Revolutionary
      Council to govern the country. Burma became a single-party state under the Burma Socialist
      Programme Party, which created an ideology based on a mixture of Marxist and Buddhist principles
      and whose aim it was to make Burma self-sufficient. This led to economic decline, isolation and
      repression.

      Indonesia declared independence in August 1945 under President Sukarno, but only in 1949 was
      war with the Dutch ended and independence officially recognized. The new state was a federation
      of the separate islands and provinces but became a unitary state in 1950. Islam had played an
      important part in the drive for independence and Sukarno provided charismatic leadership, the
      symbols of nationalism and the national language (Malay) were taught and opposition in the outer
      islands brought under control. A Communist rising had been defeated in 1948. The democratic
      parties failed to establish a stable government, and martial law was introduced in 1957. In 1959,
      supported by the armed forces, Sukarno established Guided Democracy. As president, he embodied
      the state and attempted to balance the army, the Muslims and the Communists. In 1962, Indonesia
      acquired Irian Jaya (West New Guinea) from the Dutch and in 1963 confronted Malaysia. The
      economy deteriorated, the Communists gained strength and in 1965, after an aborted coup, the army
      seized power. General Suharto became president in 1967 and established an army-dominated
      single-party state. Sukarno died in 1970. For a time, Indonesia’s economic and international
      standing improved and economically the country is booming, but other problems have come with
      this rapid social and economic growth. The tensions between the Islamic majority and minority
      religious groups such as Christians in Aceh have also had a significant impact. In recent times, the
      rise of Islamic fundamentalism is an issue.

      Burma and Indonesia are used as examples. Candidates may choose other states. India may be a
      popular choice. The role of Islam in Pakistan, Bangladesh or Malaysia; Christianity in the
      Philippines; or Buddhism and Christianity in Vietnam may also be considered.

24.   Discuss the extent to which urbanization changed social structures and the standard of living
      in one country of the region after 1945.

      Candidates may choose any country from the region. Responses need to show a clear
      understanding of what is meant by the term “urbanization”. Candidates need to demonstrate the
      links between urbanization and the social and economic changes that have taken place in the chosen
      country since the Second World War. Urbanization involves considerable upheaval and change.
      These may be both positive and negative. Social structures refer to the distinctive, stable
      arrangement of institutions whereby human beings in a society interact and live together.
      Candidates may refer to a range of changes in the social structure that have come about as a result
      of urbanization: the position of women; social mobility; population growth and distribution;
      migration from the countryside to cities; accessibility to education; effects upon rural and regional
      areas; community and political organizations; crime rates; rise of a middle class. Changes to the
      standard of living may vary: poverty and wealth will both have developed; rural areas may have
      become depressed. Look for clarity of thought, the statement of opinion based upon factual
      knowledge and specific reference. Weaker candidates will make sweeping generalizations with
      little factual reference. Better candidates should reveal knowledge, backed with evidence, of what
      urbanization entails and its impact, good or bad, upon the people of the country chosen.
