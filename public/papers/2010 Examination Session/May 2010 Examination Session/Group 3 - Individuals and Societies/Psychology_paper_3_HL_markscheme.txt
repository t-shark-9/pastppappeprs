1.   Ethics need to be carefully considered when conducting a one to one semi-
     structured interview.

     Discuss ethical considerations

     (a)   before the interview takes place                                                       [4 marks]

           Before the interview, the interviewer needs to plan questions in advance by
           ensuring that none of them contain material that is ethically doubtful. This could
           extend to such matters as gender, age, ethnicity, religion and several other issues.
           It may also be argued that the interviewer should prepare themselves thoroughly
           on the subject matter of the interview in order to help establish rapport with the
           interviewee. The prospective interviewee must be informed of the aim and nature
           of the research.

           Award [3 to 4 marks] where relevant ethical considerations are well discussed.

           Award [1 to 2 marks] where relevant ethical considerations are outlined, or
           described but no discussion is offered.


     (b)   during the interview                                                                   [4 marks]

           The interviewer should try to establish rapport with the interviewee. At the start
           of the interview the interviewee should be reminded that the information will be
           kept confidential and that the identity of the interviewee will remain anonymous.
           The right to leave the interview at any time should be mentioned and written
           consent by the interviewee should be obtained to confirm that the interview
           transcription will become the property of the interviewer or his organization.

           Award [3 to 4 marks] where relevant ethical considerations are well discussed.

           Award [1 to 2 marks] where relevant ethical considerations are outlined, or
           described but no discussion is offered.


     (c)   after the interview has finished.                                                      [2 marks]

           After the interview the interviewee should be offered the opportunity to hear the
           recording, to see the transcript and to require any amendments to be made. A
           debriefing should be provided including the opportunity for the interviewee to
           withdraw their data.

           Award [2 marks] where relevant ethical considerations are discussed.

           Award [1 mark] where relevant ethical considerations are outlined, but no
           discussion is offered.
                                                 –4–               M10/3/PSYCH/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


          N.B. Although it is possible that some degree of overlap may occur in the points
          made in answers to parts (a), (b) and (c), the examiner should expect sufficiently
          different information for each point to award marks accordingly. Marks should
          not be awarded for the same information being produced two or three times.



2.   Discuss how both participant and researcher expectancies may affect the validity
     of qualitative research.                                                         [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     Candidates should show that the operation of participant and researcher expectancies
     may make the resulting findings invalid. They may be invalid because the participant’s
     behaviour is likely to be untypical of his or her normal behaviour. Such behaviour lacks
     ecological validity. Candidates may explain that performance of participants on
     cognitively demanding tasks, for example solving a complex mathematical problem,
     tends to decrease in the presence of an audience. Biased researchers are almost certain
     to take a less than objective view of the behaviour that they investigate. A researcher’s
     expectancy may bias the results, therefore the conclusions drawn from the results may
     not be valid.

     Award [7 to 10 marks] for responses that present a detailed discussion of likely effects
     of both participant and researcher expectations on the validity of a research
     investigation.

     Award [4 to 6 marks] for responses that are mainly descriptive of participant and
     researcher expectations but offer only limited discussion of effects of these on the
     validity of research.

     Award [1 to 3 marks] for responses that offer limited definitions of participant and/or
     researcher expectancies. Answers that focus only on aspects of validity, for example
     ecological validity, and do not apply their discussion to participant and researcher
     expectancies, should receive marks in this range.

     Award up to a maximum of [5 marks] for responses addressing only participant or
     researcher expectations.

3.   Identify and evaluate ways of recording behaviour that may be used in research
     involving participant observation.                                             [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The term “participant observation” refers to an observer who is a complete participant.
     Responses may include either overt (disclosed) or covert (undisclosed) participant
     observation, or both. Recording may be achieved by hidden or open audio or video
     recording or discreet note-taking by the researcher.

     Overt participant observation usually entails the researcher becoming part of a group
     activity over a suitable period of time sufficient for relevant observations to be made.
     Importantly the others in the group are made aware of the researcher’s presence. There
     are occasions, however, when the observer makes known their presence to the group but
     does not inform them of the method of recording behaviour and conversation. This is
     done so that the normal behaviour of the group is maintained without fear of the
     recording.

     In covert observation the researcher’s true identity is not revealed. Deceit is involved,
     group members are not consulted, researchers may manipulate the situation in order to
     provoke certain actions and recordings may be made secretly, without anonymity or
     confidentiality clauses being agreed.

     Evaluation may include comments on ethical, cultural or methodological considerations
     involved in overt and/or covert participant observation.

     Candidates may well include evidence from relevant studies and this should be given
     credit.

     Award [7 to 10 marks] for identification and effective evaluation of recording methods
     appropriate to participant observation.

     Award [4 to 6 marks] for identification and mainly descriptive accounts of recording
     methods appropriate to participant observation with limited evaluation.

     Award [1 to 3 marks] for identification and minimal description of recording methods
     in general.

     If only one way of recording behaviour is concerned, then award up to a maximum of
     [5 marks].

     Award [1 mark] for merely identifying ways of recording behaviour.
