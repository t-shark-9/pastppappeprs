                                          SECTION A

Prescribed Subject 1        The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

These questions relate to the Rightly Guided Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan.

1.   (a)   Identify the key points made in Source D concerning the actions of
           Caliph Uthman.                                                              [3 marks]

            Uthman’s acquisitiveness and business acumen expanded when he became Caliph;
            The luxury of his house in Medina and his further enrichment through real estate
             acquisition;
            The impressive amount of his personal wealth;
            His enrichment at the expense of the Muslim treasury;
            His illegal actions in giving his friends access to the treasury;
            His corrupting and bribing of the companions to justify his actions.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to [3 marks].


     (b)   What is the message of Source E?                                            [2 marks]

            Identifies two versions of the Qur’anic texts which currently exist;
            Shows that Caliph Uthman issued a standard version of the Qur’an and ordered the
             destruction of all others;
            The existence of the Sana’a fragments shows that some elements of an older
             Qur’anic text survived.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to [2 marks].

           Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for
           a final mark out of [5 marks].
                                             –4–            M10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B concerning
     the actions of Caliph Uthman.                                                    [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources acknowledge that Uthman adopted policies that were different from Umar’s;
      Both recognize that he favoured members of his family and clan, giving them lucrative
       positions;
      Both refer to his centralizing policies;
      Both refer to his promulgation of a standard version of the Qur’an.

     For “contrast”
      Source A refers to Uthman claiming an enlarged authority for the Caliph to affect changes
       while Source B does not mention this;
      Source B refers to his standardization of the Qur’an as sensible, while Source A merely
       states that he created a standard version;
      Source B refers to the pious believers being scandalized by Uthman. Source A makes no
       reference to this;
      Source B refers to the impact of his measures in causing discontent among specific groups
       outside Arabia in the garrison cities of Basra, Kufa and Fustat and among Bedouins, while
       Source A describes the measures but makes no comment on their impact;
      Source B is more critical of Uthman’s predecessor than Source A;
      Source B suggests that Umar as much as Uthman was the reason for the financial problems
       and discontent. Source A merely states that Uthman reversed Umar’s policies.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material. If only one source is
     discussed, award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award
     [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed
     running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source C and Source D for historians studying the policies of
     Caliph Uthman.                                                                       [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        An extract from a historical study by M A Shaban published by Cambridge
                    University Press in 1971. The extract is from M A Shaban’s Islamic History
                    Volume I, AD 600–750 (AH 132): A New Interpretation.

     Purpose:       The author is presenting a new interpretation of events and politics in
                    Islamic history.

     Value:         The author was the Head of the Department of Arabic and Islamic Studies at a
                    major university. He is a recognized scholar and expert in the field. The work
                    may be based on extensive research and reflection. It provides an alternative
                    view about the policies of Uthman.

     Limitations:   The document will reflect the author’s own viewpoint or bias. The conclusions
                    of the work may be open to debate. It is a general history book not specifically
                    focused on Uthman.

     Source D
     Origin:        This is an extract from Arabs, Islam and the Arab Caliphate in the Early
                    Middle Ages, a historical work by E A Belyaev who was an Islamic scholar in
                    the Soviet Union.

     Purpose:       The document provides information about the policies and character of
                    Uthman.

     Value:         The author was an Islamic scholar who had done extensive research in this
                    field. The document provides detailed information about Uthman’s economic
                    policies.

     Limitations:   The document will reflect the author’s own viewpoint or bias. As a Soviet
                    scholar he may have an ideological bias against capitalism or religion.
                    In addition, his work may have been subject to censorship from the
                    government of the USSR.

     Do not expect all the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one
     source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must
     refer to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.
                                              –6–             M10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.    Using these sources and your own knowledge, assess to what extent the
      criticisms of Uthman’s caliphate were justified.                                   [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A:    Uthman was an aristocrat, belonging to the powerful Umayyad clan. He
                  reversed Umar’s policies by favouring men of his clan and other Meccans’
                  interests at the expense of the companions of the Prophet and the Medinans.
                  He exerted central control over provincial revenues and kept a closer account
                  of Sawafi lands. He took some initiative in religious matters by promulgating a
                  standard edition of the Qur’an.

     Source B:     Uthman faced difficulties in maintaining the pension payments. He faced a
                   growing army with diminished stipends (which was a legacy of Umar). At the
                   same time, prices rose. By favouring relatives with high offices and lucrative
                   contracts, Uthman provoked the discontent of the Medinans, already shocked
                   by the greed of the Meccans. He also alienated the fiercely independent
                   Bedouin tribesmen of the camp-cities, who resented central authority. He also
                   angered the pious believers because of his standard edition of the Qur’an, and
                   the destruction of all non-authorized copies.

     Source C:     Uthman’s relatives were competent and experienced men. They were
                   trustworthy and loyal and it was a calculated and shrewd policy to nominate
                   them as governors. Uthman strengthened the position of Amir al-Mu’minin.

     Source D:     Uthman was acquisitive and had business talents. Uthman possessed a
                   luxurious house and increased his real estate wealth. Uthman greatly increased
                   his personal wealth while in the seat of power and used the treasury for his own
                   ends. Uthman took some illegal actions to consolidate his rule. Uthman
                   corrupted the companions by making them complicit with his depredations. He
                   opened the way to flattery and self-interest.

     Source E:     Uthman is the one that ordered the standard Qur’an, which is the one used up
                   to now by Muslims. He destroyed other versions of the Qur’an. Despite the
                   ban on other copies of the Qur’an, the existence of fragments from Sana’a
                   shows that the ban was not entirely successful.

     Own knowledge:
     Uthman may be criticized for the following reasons: contrary to his pledge to follow in the
     steps of the two Caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar at the meeting of the Shura which convened to
     nominate the new Caliph, Uthman reversed policies which were consensually agreed upon,
     such as changing Umar’s policy of the Diwan. The vacillating and weak character of Uthman
     made him vunerable to his unscrupulous relatives. Thus he failed to command respect.
     Another example of his indecisive character was in his dealings with his would-be murderers.

     It may be argued that criticisms of Uthman are not justified for the following reasons:
     his nomination of relatives to key positions was dictated by new circumstances and
     new challenges. The momentum of the conquests was over; new conquests did not bring the
     material advantages of the previous ones; the treasury had been depleted by the generosity
     of Umar; the fertile lands of the Sawad needed to be brought under a tighter fiscal control;
     and the extension of the Empire called for a more centralized government. In the
     redistribution of revenues, Uthman was attempting to reconcile the Umma after the Ridda
                                          –7–            M10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Wars (“Wars of Apostasy”), by fully reintegrating the Ridda warriors in the army. On the
other hand, he needed more troops because of the vastness of the Empire. His reinforcement
of the central government was dictated by the new reality that the Umma had become an
empire, with all the trappings required by a central government. Uthman was a rich man who
spent his own money on the Umma. The decision of Uthman to legislate a canonical Qur’an
was wise, as it prevented future divisiveness and speculations about the content of the Qur’an.

Do not expect all the above, and credit other relevant material. If only source material or
only knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a
maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as
well as references to the sources used.

Prescribed Subject 2        The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These sources relate to the foundation and early years of the kingdom of Sicily under Roger II
(1130–1154).

1.   (a)   According to Source B, why did Roger II become King of Sicily?                 [3 marks]

              He consulted learned churchmen and other important leaders;
              He received the unanimous support of these individuals;
              He already held Sicily and other lands;
              He had gained lands through military prowess and inheritance;
              It was believed that Sicily had been a kingdom in the past and should be restored to
               that status.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid point made up to [3 marks].


     (b)   What message about Roger II is conveyed by Source E?                           [2 marks]

            The image of lions attacking camels alludes to the triumph of Christianity over
             Islam;
            There was a royal silk workshop to create garments to elevate the status of the King;
            Some of Roger II’s Muslim subjects praised his strength and skill, and wished him a
             long reign, implying he was fair in his dealings with Muslims;
            The use of Arabic on the cloak shows that this language was accepted by Roger II;
            The King led a luxurious life.

           Accept other valid interpretations, with [1 mark] for each valid point up to [2 marks].

     Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
     final mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about how
     Roger II became King of Sicily.                                                    [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both documents acknowledge the existence of two rival Popes;
      Both sources refer to the roles of Pope Anacletus II and Roger II in founding the kingdom
       of Sicily;
      Both sources refer to the need of Pope Anacletus II for support against his rival,
       Innocent II;
      Roger sought papal approval for his kingship;
      Roger had a well-developed plan to become King.

     For “contrast”
      Source C gives a specific month for when the decision was taken to create the kingdom,
       whereas Source D only mentions the Pope’s order that it be created, but does not specify
       a date;
      Source C discusses whether the idea of creating a monarchy first came from Roger II or
       Innocent II, whereas Source D only mentions that it happened;
      Source C mentions that Anacletus II’s election as Pope happened in bizarre circumstances,
       whereas Source D only mentions that there was a rival Pope;
      Source D mentions the false claim that Sicily had been ruled by kings in the past, which is
       not mentioned in Source C;
      Source D mentions Emperor Lothar III of Germany’s opposition to the coronation, which
       is not mentioned in Source C;
      Source D also mentions that Emperor Lothar III later invaded the kingdom of Sicily, which
       is not mentioned in Source C;
      Source D mentions that Roger’s kingship was endorsed by nobles and churchmen, which is
       not mentioned in Source C.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material. If only one source is
     discussed, award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award
     [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed
     running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and
     limitations of Source A and Source B for historians studying the foundation
     of the kingdom of Sicily.                                                               [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        A history of the kings of Sicily written in Sicily in the late twelfth century.

     Purpose:       To narrate the lives and deeds of the kings of Sicily.

     Value:         Written in Sicily shortly after the events he describes, the author explains how
                    the fortunes of the kingdom reflected the sharp contrast in the characters of the
                    kings themselves.

     Limitations:   The identity of the author remains questionable. Hugo Falcandus is strongly
                    biased in favour of King Roger II and against his son, William I. He covers
                    only the period between 1154 and 1169.

     Source B
     Origin:        A chronicle of the events in the kingdom, written in Sicily by Alexander of
                    Telese during the reign of Roger II, and apparently commissioned by the
                    King’s sister.

     Purpose:       To record the deeds of Roger II and events in his kingdom.

     Value:         It was written by a learned contemporary of King Roger II, who would have
                    had first-hand knowledge of his actions. The author was a member of the court
                    and a close associate of the King.

     Limitations:   The author was an abbot in Sicily during Roger II’s lifetime and perhaps
                    depended on the King for favour. His work was commissioned by the King’s
                    own sister and so may show strong bias in favour of Roger II. The work shows
                    strong support for Roger II. As a contemporary account, it lacks broader and
                    long term historical perspective.


     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     discussed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in
     Source B that Roger II became King of Sicily because his own nobles and
     churchmen “unanimously decided and insisted” that he do so.                           [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A:    States that Roger was intelligent, self-assured, cautious and sought the advice
                  of those at court. The peace he established through his efforts quickly ended
                  when his son took over the kingdom which began to reflect the nature and
                  personality of the new ruler.

     Source B:     Emphasizes the popular support that Roger II commanded from the Church
                   and nobility of Sicily. It claims that he became King because they demanded
                   unanimously that he do so. It also notes that through inheritance and
                   conquest he ruled Sicily and other territories. It claims that there had
                   already been a kingdom of Sicily in the past, and that Roger II was right to
                   resurrect it. It also claims that Sicily had the right to further expand its
                   territories.

     Source C:     Puts the creation of the kingdom of Sicily in the context of the rivalry
                   between Pope Anacletus II and Pope Innocent II. It debates the evidence for
                   whether the idea for creating the kingdom came first from Roger II or
                   Anacletus II. It states that Anacletus II needed Roger II’s support against
                   his rival.

     Source D:     Emphasizes the benefit for Anacletus II of gaining recognition from Roger II,
                   over his rival, Innocent II. It mentions that Roger II was brought into this
                   struggle as the price for being recognized by Anacletus II. It also explains
                   that Emperor Lothar III of Germany had a claim of overlordship of Sicily to
                   rival that of the Pope, and that Emperor Lothar III later invaded Sicily. It also
                   explains that Roger II’s claim that Sicily had previously been ruled by kings
                   was false.

     Source E:     Emphasizes the virtues that Roger II claimed to have as a ruler through
                   powerful symbolism and words of praise. It shows that Roger II had an
                   official factory to produce beautiful garments that praised him. It also
                   suggests that at least some of Roger II’s Muslim subjects shared in this praise.


     Own knowledge:
     Support from his own Sicilian subjects played an important role in bringing Roger II to
     power. The presence of a large number of noblemen and churchmen at his coronation
     ceremony in Palermo would suggest that he had the support of the great men of Sicily.
     Once crowned, Roger II continued to enjoy the support of his Sicilian subjects, Muslim as
     well as Christian. However, some of the nobility of southern Italy continued to resist
     Roger II’s claims to rule over them as King.

     Before he was crowned King, Roger ruled as Count of Sicily and later as Duke of Apulia and
     Calabria, which were titles that he inherited from his father Roger I. Following the death of
     his nephew William, Duke of Apulia, in 1127, Roger II had become the principal male heir,
     but he could not have been crowned King without papal approval. However, Anacletus II’s
     disputed title meant that he was vulnerable to attack from his rival Innocent II. Anacletus II

fact, ruler of Sicily and southern Italy, Anacletus II may have had little choice other than to
recognize him as King.

The struggle between Anacletus II and Innocent II over the Papacy played an important role
in the creation of the kingdom of Sicily. The Papacy claimed overlordship over Sicily and
southern Italy.

The creation of the kingdom of Sicily can also be seen in the context of the struggle between
the Papacy and the German Emperors for control of Italy. Emperor Lothar III of Germany
disputed the Papacy’s claim to overlordship over Italy and Sicily. Emperor Lothar III also
wanted to overthrow Roger II by supporting his enemies among the nobility of southern Italy.
When allied together, Anacletus II and Roger II had greater strength to resist Emperor
Lothar III.
