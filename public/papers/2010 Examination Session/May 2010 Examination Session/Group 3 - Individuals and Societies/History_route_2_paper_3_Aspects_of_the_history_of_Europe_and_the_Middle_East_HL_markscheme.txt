uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
         detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
         are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is
        limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
        but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth, historical
        knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in
        nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
        commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
        an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either
        chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
        generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
        and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
        top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth
        knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to
        indicate some in-depth understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are
        placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
        comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present, but not always consistently
        integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
        knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
        such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
        interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
        balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
        commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
        may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
        may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
        present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
        contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
        well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   To what extent was Louis XVI responsible for the outbreak of revolution in France in 1789?

     Louis XVI was king of France from 1774. He was deposed in 1792 and executed in 1793.
     Candidates must consider how far he was responsible for the outbreak of revolution in 1789. Some
     points to analyse for his responsibility are: his personality was unsuitable for ruling, he was
     awkward, indecisive, lacking in self-confidence, but regarded his kingship as a duty from God;
     he had little knowledge of the state of France, as he rarely moved out of the Paris–Versailles area;
     he did not understand finance, and failed to realize that the cost of taking part in the War of
     American Independence, and failure to change the outdated tax system bankrupted the monarchy;
     he failed to support reforms suggested by his ministers including Turgot, Necker, Calonne and
     Brienne; he, and especially his wife, were considered to be extravagant; his part in calling the
     Estates General acted as a trigger for the outbreak of revolution

     Candidates could also briefly consider other causes in order to satisfy “to what extent”, such as the
     philosophers, poor economic situation with bad harvests, etc., the opposition of the nobility to
     change from a system from which they profited, but this question should not be changed into a
     “general causes of the French Revolution” question. The main focus should be on the responsibility
     of Louis XVI.


2.   “Napoleon will trample underfoot [destroy] the rights of man, put himself above them and
     become a tyrant.” To what extent was this prediction correct?

     This question requires candidates to consider the reign of Napoleon I, and to analyse his actions and
     policies to decide if he was a tyrant. Mentioning the rights of man, suggests that the French
     Revolution gave “rights” to the French people, candidates could also compare Napoleon’s rule with
     the revolutionary era, and give judgement on which was more tyrannical. Thus there are two
     possible ways to answer this question.

     Briefly, the French Revolution was positive and beneficial in that it ended the old feudal system and
     outdated monarchy and gave rights to all citizens. It also harmed France with much bloodshed and
     lack of good government which failed to maintain law and order.

     Napoleon became First Consul in 1799 and Emperor in 1804. He too had positive and negative
     effects. Many of his reforms, such as bringing the provinces under central control, preserving many
     of the gains of the revolution in the Code Napoleon and making a concordat with the Pope, were
     carried out before 1804.

     Answers should consider the nature of the Napoleonic state, what rights the French people had and
     the extent that the Napoleonic code protected them. Napoleon used Fouché and his police to
     monitor and control potential opposition.

3.   Analyse the political factors involved in the unification of Italy up to 1861.

     Political factors could include some of the following: republicanism; the monarchy; constitutional
     rights, or the lack of them; the division of Italy into separate states; foreign involvement; and the
     part played by the Papacy. Candidates will probably not address all of these, and weaker candidates
     will narrate Italian unification with only implicit attention to political factors. A thematic approach
     or structure would probably be most appropriate.

     Points to consider could include: monarchical rule was considered tyrannical, especially in the
     kingdom of the Two Sicilies under Ferdinand II, but Piedmont/Sardinia was granted a constitution,
     and regarded as a constitutional monarchy. Republicanism was preached by Mazzini in his Young
     Italy movement and in his revolutionary actions, such as the setting up of the Roman Republic in
     1848. Garibaldi was originally a republican follower of Mazzini, but changed in 1861 to support a
     united Italian kingdom under Victor Emmanuel II; the internal politics of Piedmont, with Cavour as
     prime minister could also be considered, including Cavour’s aims. Was it to strengthen Piedmont
     or to unify Italy? The role of European powers in Italian unification could be assessed, especially
     those of Austria, Britain and France. Candidates may argue that the wealth and strength of
     Piedmont was more important than political factors/ideas.

     There is thus much material that candidates should have studied, but do not expect or demand all of
     the above. Focused analysis is necessary for a “good” mark.


4.   Discuss the relative importance of the decline of Austria and the policies of Bismarck as
     causes of German unification.

     This question is focused on the weakness of Austria and Bismarck’s policies. The wording of the
     question should lead candidates to structure their answers to address these two areas. They should
     also judge their relative importance. Candidates should back their choice with specific analysis and
     a clear argument.

     Austria was overstretched by the Congress of Vienna and excluded from the Zolverein and suffered
     from nationalist tensions within the Empire. There was also a lack of raw materials for industrial
     advancements, a refusal to modernize, economically or politically and a generally backward looking
     outlook. A brief comment on the contrast with Prussia’s strengths could be made relevant.

     The question is not intended to provoke narratives of Bismarck’s three wars, but to be an analysis of
     how his policies led to German unification. His attention to the economy, diplomacy, and the army
     should be examined, followed by an explanation of the importance of the wars in bringing about
     German unification. Some answers may focus on Bismarck’s opportunism and question whether
     unification was his aim.

     The conclusion on “relative importance” should be consistent with specific evidence in the two
     sections. If only one section is addressed mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                 –6–             M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M+

5.   Why was the Ottoman Empire regarded as an empire in decline in the nineteenth century?

     The focus of the question is “why” the empire was in decline. Factors to be considered could
     include internal problems such as nationalist agitation within the empire, which led to Greek
     independence in 1831, loss of territory such as Egypt and constant unrest in areas such as Bulgaria.
     Other problems include: difficulty in implementing reforms because of the resistance of traditional
     elements; financial weakness; weak sultans. Internationally the frequent intervention of the other
     major powers highlighted the weakness of the empire (Crimea, Russo/Turkish War, Congress of
     Berlin, etc.) and contributed to continuing decline.


6.   Analyse the causes and results of civil war in Lebanon in 1860.

     In the mid-eighteenth century Lebanon was part of the Ottoman Empire. The main factions in the
     country were the Druze (whose religion was of Islamist origin) and the Maronite Christians.
     Because of conflict between the two, Mount Lebanon was divided into Maronite and Druze
     districts. This increased tension by making power bases for the opposing factions. Maronites also
     rebelled against the Ottoman Empire, and in 1858 the old feudal system of taxes and levies ended.
     In 1860 a full scale civil war broke out. The Maronites openly opposed the Ottomans, so the
     Druzes took advantage and burned Maronite villages. The Turks tried to restore peace and order,
     and Napoleon III sent in 7 000 French troops.

     Results could include: large numbers of Maronite casualties (4 000 killed and a similar number died
     of destitution, plus 100 000 were made homeless); continued communal tension and violence; the
     forcing of Maronites into an enclave cut off from Beirut; Christian resentment and poverty.

     On the other hand, candidates could argue that the Confessional structure which was established led
     to relative stability for the next half century.
                                                   –7–           M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M+

7.   Examine the nature and development of political parties in Britain between 1867 and 1914.

     By 1914 there were three main political parties in Britain: Conservatives, Liberals and Labour.
     Candidates need to examine the state of the parties between these dates.

     The Conservative Party was originally known as the Tory Party. Disraeli was largely responsible
     for its nature between 1867 and 1914. Its programme was based on a commitment to traditional
     institutions, defence of the British Empire and plus some protectionist trade policies. The
     Conservative Party and the Liberal Party were the two major parties in Britain until the 1920s.

     The Liberal Party was originally the Whig Party. It was joined by dissident Tories after Peel split
     the Tory/Conservative Party. Its main features were free trade, reform and restraint in foreign
     affairs. Some members left the party and joined the Conservatives in opposition to Gladstone’s
     Irish policies. The liberals were the party of the middle class non-conformists.

     The Labour Party only became an “official” party in 1906, when it was formed from the members
     of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC). In 1874 two trade unionists were elected as
     Liberal MPs. Keir Hardie initiated a campaign amongst the various socialist organizations, that a
     political party should be formed. Hardie and two supporters were elected as independent MPs in
     1892. The Independent Labour Party was formed in 1893, followed by the LRC in 1900. In 1906
     the 26 MP members of the LRC changed its name to the Labour Party.

     All of the parties had a class base to some extent.


8.   Why did the Second French Empire, ruled by Napoleon III, collapse in 1870?

     Prince Louis Napoleon was elected president of the Second French Republic and became Emperor
     in 1852. Some of the points to analyse in order to explain why the Empire collapsed (a plebiscite in
     1870 confirmed a new constitution by 7.2 million votes to 1.5 million against) could be: the age and
     ill health of Napoleon, who was persuaded to enter war against Bismarck and Prussia; defeat in
     diplomacy and then in the Franco–Prussian War by Bismarck; this defeat led to Napoleon’s
     overthrow and the end of the Second Empire; early ambitious and expensive foreign policies such
     as Mexico had weakened the French army and national finances; early policies and the change to
     the “liberal Empire” with the new constitution, might be made relevant.

     Some argument could be made for the view that demands for the republic came from Paris, which
     had always been hostile to the Empire. The plebiscite of 1870 indicated that the Empire and
     Napoleon had the support of most French people.
                                                  –8–             M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M+

9.    “His measures of reform did not disguise his belief in the need to maintain autocratic rule.”
      To what extent do you agree with this view of Alexander II?

      Many candidates will probably agree with the quotation, firstly by saying that Alexander’s motives
      for reform were to preserve his position and authority as Tsar; that he realized the necessity for
      reform, especially after Russian failure in the Crimean War; and that reform was better from above
      than below. A key point for this view is that although the serfs were emancipated and local
      assemblies instituted, no national assembly, or Duma/parliament, was put in place. Another line of
      argument could be that emancipation did not satisfy many of the aspirations of the peasants, or
      improve their economic positions, and that other economic reforms, such as building railways
      which stimulated growth in coal, iron and other industries, also benefited the monarchy. The army
      reforms, which were largely successful also supported the maintenance of autocratic rule. Many of
      the reforms replaced the roles previously filled by the nobility.

      The quotation could be challenged by Alexander being called the “Tsar Liberator”, the importance
      and nature of judicial and educational reforms, as well as an assessment of the enormity of granting
      freedom and rights to the serfs.


10.   Compare and contrast the causes and nature of the two 1917 Russian Revolutions.

      The factual details of the two Russian Revolutions of 1917, are often confused. The first was in
      February/March, and the second, often called the Bolshevik Revolution, was in October/November.

      Some areas to compare are: both were against the government in power; both were opposed to the
      current government; both brought great change; the First World War and the hardships it caused
      was a factor in both; peasants, workers and the Soviets played some part in both. Economic crisis
      was also a factor in both.

      Areas of contrast could include: the first revolution was a spontaneous mass movement which
      developed out of an almost general strike, whereas the Bolshevik Revolution was more of a coup,
      planned by the Bolshevik Party; the first was against the Tsar, the second to overthrow the
      Provisional Government; the Tsar was overthrown in the first, and killed after the second. There
      was less bloodshed and violence in the second: five soldiers, one sailor and no defenders were
      killed. The first revolution was unplanned and spontaneous, the second was a coup d’etat.

      If only one of the 1917 Revolutions is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                   –9–             M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M+

11.   Evaluate continuity and change in German foreign policy between 1871 and 1914.

      In 1871 Bismarck as Chancellor was in charge of foreign policy. Bismarck wished for a period of
      peace in order to consolidate the Empire, and avoid war with Austria-Hungary or France. The latter
      especially had to be isolated to prevent a war of revenge. Bismarck succeeded by making a
      complicated alliance system: the Dreikaiserbund (1871), the Dual Alliance with Austria (1879), the
      Triple Alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy (1882) and the Reinsurance Treaty (1887) with
      Russia. Bismarck presided at the Berlin Conference (1878), claiming to wish to avoid colonial
      involvement, but protectorates were established later in South West Africa and the Cameroons.

      German foreign policy changed with the accession of William II: The Reinsurance Treaty with
      Russia was not renewed, leading to a Franco–Russian Alliance in 1894. More colonies were sought,
      Germany supported the Boers in South Africa against the British and the German navy was
      enlarged, leading Britain to ally with France and Russia. Crises occurred in the Balkans and
      Morocco. Austria continued its alliance with Germany, thus after the assassination of the heir to the
      Austro-Hungarian throne at Sarajevo in June 1914, Germany supported Austria’s demands.
      Germany’s foreign policy had changed from 1890. William pursued Weltpolitik but was frequently
      inconsistent in his approach.


12.   Analyse the successes and failures of one post-First World War treaty.

      This will probably be a popular question, with the majority choosing the Treaty of Versailles.
      The Paris Peace Conference took place in Paris from 18 January 1919 to 20 January 1920.
      The following treaties were produced: Versailles with Germany, St Germain with Austria, Neuilly
      with Bulgaria and Trianon with Hungary. The Treaty of Sèvres with Turkey was not published
      until 10 August 1920 when it was accepted by the Sultan. However it was rejected by the republic
      of Atatürk, and revised as the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) could also
      be chosen.

      Whichever treaty is chosen, one success could be that the treaty was agreed and published, and a
      weakness that the defeated states did not take part in the negotiations and resented this.
      The treaties established a degree of self-determination, and it was hoped that the newly founded
      League of Nations would be able to rectify any weaknesses or injustices.

      Details will depend on the treaty chosen, and be prepared for more weaknesses than strengths,
      especially with Versailles. The answer must be focused on the treaty, not on the rise of Hitler, and
      note that the “guilt clause” applied to Germany and its allies. For a “good” mark candidates should
      discuss individual clauses, and point out strengths and weaknesses, rather than writing generalized
      unsupported criticisms.

      Failures might focus on the areas of each treaty which left lasting resentments, leading to future
      problems – such as the mandate system and Revisionism.
                                                  – 10 –           M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M+

13.   Assess the importance of the Palestine Mandate (1920–1948).

      The main focus of most answers will probably be that violence and tensions within the mandate
      caused instability in the region with long-term consequences. There is much material that can be
      used to illustrate tensions such as the contradictions of wartime diplomacy (MacMahon–Hussein
      correspondence, Balfour Declaration), Wailing War Riots, Arab General Strike (1936) and failed
      Commissions. Continued violence post-1945 highlighted British weakness.

      Higher level marks should be reserved for those answers which assess “importance”. Accept any
      relevant material such as references to UNSCOP activity which highlights how important Palestine
      was in international terms.


14.   “The father and founder of modern Turkey.” To what extent does this statement explain the
      role and policies of Atatürk?

      Mustapha Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938) assumed the patronymic Atatürk, meaning “Father of the
      Turks” in 1934, when he wished all Turkish families to adopt Western style surnames. If candidates
      focus on three aspects of his life and rule – founder, modernizer, and father – they should be able to
      focus their answer clearly.

      As the “founder”, Atatürk had a successful military career during the Balkan and First World Wars,
      then began a nationalist revolution, organizing resistance to the dismembering of Turkey. He
      opposed the Treaty of Sèvres, and obtained revision of it in the Treaty of Lausanne. He gained
      control of Constantinople after the Chanak crisis, and abolished the sultanate in 1922. In 1923 a
      Turkish Republic was proclaimed with Atatürk as president.

      As president, Atatürk sought to modernize – and secularize Turkey: he abolished the Caliphate,
      emancipated women, encouraged Western dress, introduced a Latin alphabet, developed industry
      and reformed education. He also tried to modernize and develop the Turkish economy. There was
      limited political modernization.

      To what extent Atatürk was “father” of Turkey, is open to interpretation. He fostered national pride
      in Turkey rather than to Islam, and ruled as a dictator until his death.
                                                 – 11 –           M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EM/M+

15.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of Hitler and Mussolini.

      Comparison: both authoritarian rulers, both fostered a Cult of Personality/strong leadership.
      Hitler – Fuhrer, Mussolini – Duce. Both used coercion and terror to control potential opposition
      (GESTAPO/OVRA). Both used propaganda effectively. Both attempted to reach accommodation
      with the Church. Education was controlled and Youth movements were established to indoctrinate
      the young. Leisure activities were also influenced by the government.

      Both focused on the economy but the levels of government intervention varied (Four Year Plan,
      Corporate state, search Autarky).

      Contrast: Hitler’s domestic policies were underpinned by his desire to establish the racially pure
      Volksgemeinschaft. From 1935 anti-semitic legislation was passed to marginalise the Jews, in Italy
      Mussolini did not introduce anti-semitic policies until 1937, they were not rigorously applied.

      The main contrast was the level of personal power, Hitler and the Nazis were totally dominant
      whereas in Italy traditional power centres such as the Church and to a lesser extent the monarchy
      remained influential.

      Do not demand all the above, and accept other domestic policies. If only Hitler or Mussolini is
      addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


16.   For what reasons, and to what extent, did attempts to achieve collective security between 1919
      and 1939 fail?

      Collective security was a term widely used in international diplomacy between the wars. It implied
      that the security of individual states was guaranteed jointly by other states.

      The League of Nations was responsible for implementing this policy especially in the 1920’s. In
      the 1930’s the term could be applied to the Non-Aggression and Mutual Assistance Pacts (e.g.
      Franco/Soviet/Czech Pact 1936) which were signed to limit the aggression of the dictators.
      Reasons could also include the impact of the Depression.

      Failure could be attributed to the weaknesses of the League, it’s loss of credibility in the 1930’s
      after the Manchurian and Abyssinian crises. Failure to negotiate disarmament also undermined the
      credibility of the League. The British pursuit of Appeasement also weakened attempts to establish
      collective security. By the late 1930’s states were pursuing policies independently of the League to
      protect their own security (Nazi-Soviet Pact August 1939). Failure could also be attributed to the
      more dangerous atmosphere of the 1930’s.

17.   A colleague said of Stalin: “His last years were the most dangerous. He swung to extremes”.
      To what extent do you agree with this view?

      Candidates often ignore Stalin post-1945, except in relation to the Cold War. This question does
      also allow candidates to consider his earlier rule, as they could disagree with the quotation by
      giving and analysing dangerous policies, actions, etc. pre-1945, or even 1941. However, candidates
      will not score well if they just dismiss the quotation, and concentrate on his early years. The last
      years must be the focus, and candidates should not be penalized for only assessing his “last years”.
      Danger points in his early years could include collectivization and anti-kulak policy, purges,
      especially of Party and the military. But what the speaker probably was referring to was his attitude
      and behaviour within USSR and government after the war. Terror and purges were renewed,
      colleagues never knew where they stood with him, one day in favour, another fearing imprisonment
      or death.

      Detail might include: the Leningrad Affair, the Doctors Plot, treatment of returning Russian POW’s,
      the marginalisation of Zhukov and the Red Army, the power of the MVD, all indicated Stalin’s
      ruthless control.

      It is hoped that this question will cause candidates to think, and write interesting thoughtful original
      answers. Mark what is there, and do not have a preconceived idea of what to expect or demand.

18.   For what reasons, and with what results, was Khrushchev successful in the power struggle
      after Stalin’s death in 1953?

      Khrushchev was to be perceived to be a loyal follower of Stalin, and his rivals underestimated his
      ambition and ruthlessness (seen during his wartime career).

      Main contenders were Malenkov, Bulganin and Molotov as well as Khrushchev – all of them feared
      and disliked Beria who was swiftly arrested and shot by Zhukov after Stalin’s death.

      Khrushchev advantages included the support of the Red Army, his role as Party Secretary which he
      used to widen his support and outmanoeuvre his colleagues. He was also well known in Russia,
      travelling widely and listening to the people.

      In 1956 he delivered his “Secret Speech” criticising Stalin and was able to survive attempts to
      remove him from the Central Committee because of his support in the party and his rivals
      subsequently resigned.

      Results: Khrushchev dominated Russian government until 1964. He started a process of
      destalinisation within the Soviet Union and the satellite states (leading to unrest at times, Hungary
      and East Germany). He introduced progressive economic measures in the Soviet Union which
      helped improve external relations with the west and enabled him to pursue a policy of Peaceful
      Coexistence.

19.   Evaluate the reasons for the formation of NATO and the impact of its policies up to 2000.

      NATO was formed in 1949 after the division of Germany to defend western states against the threat
      of Soviet aggression. Member states included the USA, UK, France, Canada, Iceland’s etc. In the
      fifties, West Germany, Greece and Turkey joined. The treaty committed its members to treat an
      attack on one as an attack on all. Members had to contribute to the NATO defence force under a
      multi-national command.

      Impact: The Warsaw Pact was established to a response to NATO in 1955.
      It was an effective deterrent during the Cold War but also had a role as peace keeper in tense
      situations (Suez, Congo).
      It’s policy of first strike attack was considered to raise tensions and increase the risk of nuclear war
      in the 1970’s and early 1980’s. Post 1989 NATO’s role was redefined and although still defensive,
      NATO has much more frequently been perceived as a humanitarian task force deployed in various
      trouble spots (Balkan wars of the 1990’s, Rwanda).

      If only reasons are addressed then no more than [8 marks]. Impact should be considered fully for
      higher level marks.


20.   Analyse Franco’s regime and explain why Spain became a democratic nation after his death
      in 1975.

      This question addresses Franco’s Spain after success in the Spanish Civil War. In April 1939, the
      war ended and Franco became head of state, and presided over an authoritarian regime until his
      death in 1975. Some aspects of his regime to analyse are: the nature of his authority; relations with
      the Catholic Church; keeping Spain out of the Second World War; his anti-Communist stance
      which led to some rapprochement with the West, and the Bases Agreement with the USA;
      economic and educational reforms and modernization.

      His modernization of the Spanish economy, the growth of tourism, etc. made it impossible to
      maintain a strict authoritarian state. He probably realized this, and thus he began preparations for a
      return to democracy. In 1969, Franco announced that when he died Spain should return to a
      monarchy under Juan Carlos, grandson of the last monarch. This was successfully accomplished
      and within two years, most traces of Franco’s dictatorship had disappeared and Spain was
      established as a stable constitutional monarchy. Reasons why might be considered to be Spain’s
      integration in the European community and modernisation of society.

21.   Compare and contrast the economic policies of Nasser and Sadat in Egypt.

      Comparisons: Both Nasser (1918–1970) and Sadat (1918–1981) realized that the Egyptian economy
      was weak, and tried to improve it; it remained poor in spite of their efforts. Also both their
      economic policies were affected by political considerations. As their economic policies differed
      considerably, candidates will probably find more to contrast, than compare. Both had authoritarian
      political systems.

      Contrasts: Nasser’s policies were socialist. He nationalized the Suez Canal, guaranteed
      employment in the public sector, nationalized industries, sought to redistribute land, and aimed at
      self-sufficiency. He introduced free education, and to a certain extent did champion the middle
      class, but his most important economic policy was probably the Aswan Dam.

      Sadat tried to distance himself from Nasser’s policies with his “open door” policy. He did
      consolidate the public sector, but allowed private sector growth, some capitalist measures related to
      a “free market economy”. The continued closure of the Suez Canal caused revenue losses. Sadat
      encouraged foreign trade, but this caused a trade deficit, and exports fell. A new upper class of
      merchants developed and inflation increased.

      If only Nasser or only Sadat is considered, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


22.   Account for the uneasy relations between Israel and the Arab world between 1950 and 1993.

      In 1948 the United Nations Partition Plan was, in spite of much opposition, put into effect, and
      Palestine was divided into Arab and Jewish sectors. The new state of Israel was declared in May
      1948. It was promptly invaded by the armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon. The
      Israelis won, and occupied more territory than had been allocated to them. A million Palestinian
      Arabs fled to refugee camps, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was formed.

      It is not necessary for candidates to explain and recount the pre-1950 problems in full, but the
      situation between 1948 and 1950 could be considered a reason for uneasy relations between Israel
      and the Arab world. Other points to consider could include: refugee problems; the issue of
      occupied territories; refusal of many Arab states and organizations to recognize Israel; the various
      wars fought between the two, e.g. Suez War 1956, Six Day War 1967, 1973 October or Yom
      Kippur War; failure of peace talks, including Camp David Agreement and Israeli PLO agreement
      (1993); Arab terrorist movements, including PLO and Hamas; Israeli invasion of Lebanon (1982);
      wealth of Israel and poverty of Palestinians; religious and ethnic differences.

      Candidates should be well-informed on this topic, but do not expect or demand all the above.

23.   In what ways, and with what results, was there an “industrial revolution” in one country of
      the region in the fifty years you have studied?

      Candidates can select one country, and any 50 year period – it does not have to be 1800–1850,
      1850–1900, 1900–1950 or 1950–2000. “In what ways” suggests an explanation of the “industrial
      revolution”, and the results can cover: effects on industry; life style; riches and poverty; demands
      for increased education, especially technical education and training; leisure; housing; transport;
      increased status of the selected country; trade, especially for raw materials; etc.

      Details will depend on the country chosen, but specific evidence must be presented.


24.   With reference to one country of the region, either in the nineteenth century or the twentieth
      century, analyse the importance of two of the following: health reforms; gender issues;
      immigration; emigration.

      Health reforms would require both medical advancement and legislation, including legislation to
      improve environmental conditions to improve health.

      Gender issues would cover issues such as education, training, employment opportunities,
      discrimination, the franchise, family responsibilities, leisure, sport, health care, etc.

      Immigration could include: reasons for it; position of immigrants in a new country, welcome or
      unwelcome; language problems; employment and/or unemployment; racial ghettos; integration; etc.

      Emigration could include: situations that produced emigration; effects on original country; shortage
      of labour; countries favoured for emigration, etc.

      If only one topic is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks], and allocate at least
      [8 marks] for the weaker topic if the answer is unbalanced.
