                               Texas oil tycoon aims to harness power of wind

           One of the biggest problems facing the United States (USA) in the next 50 years is how to
            satisfy its energy demands. This will require some tough choices involving opportunity cost.
            Currently the USA imports 70 % of its oil needs. Should US oil drilling be increased or is the
            answer to expand the use of wind energy?

           T Boone Pickens, an American businessman is famous for thinking big. Over the next
            four years he intends to erect 2700 wind turbines across Texas at a cost of US$54 billion.
            His scheme is five times bigger than the world’s largest wind farm, and when finished
            will generate enough electricity for one million homes. His idea is to use wind-generated energy
            as a substitute for natural gas used to produce electricity. The natural gas will then be used to
            fuel cars in order to reduce the demand for oil. Pickens aims to make a gross profit of 25 %,
            aided by a government subsidy for alternative energy creation.

           Texas, with its wide open spaces, low population and steady winds, should be perfect for
            wind-generated energy. Pickens has persuaded neighbouring farmers to join his scheme in
            return for annual payments of between US$10 000 – US$20 000 for each turbine on their land,
            which will not interfere with farming. Pickens refuses to have any of the turbines on his own
            property because “they are ugly’’.

           The nearby town of Sweetwater is in the middle of a huge “construction boom” that is
            increasing investment demand. Two new companies have just opened, one to service the
            blades of the 2700 turbines, and another renting out cranes to build the new turbines.
            These new economic opportunities have increased the population of the town and created
            many new jobs, not only in the manufacture of the turbines and blades, but also in
            their maintenance. New roads and houses are being built, while local schools and medical
            centres have been renovated using the extra tax revenue from the energy companies.

           Supporters of the Pickens plan believe the US economy will benefit, through increased direct
            foreign investment, increased private domestic investment and a decreased need to import oil
            from overseas, all of which will contribute to economic growth.

           Opposition to the wind farm has come from environmentalists who are concerned with the
            negative impact on wildlife and the destruction of the habitat of a rare bird. Concern has also
            been expressed about the noise the turbines will make and the visual pollution to what was a
            scenic area.

                                                 Pakistan’s economy

           There was a positive transformation in the Pakistani economy in the early 2000s.
            The exchange rate was allowed to float, exports of primary commodities increased along
            with foreign direct investment and foreign reserves, while government debt fell.

           By 2007, however, Pakistan faced a number of political and economic problems. In addition
            to political instability, there were hailstorms and diseases destroying crops, which led to large
            increases in food imports. The price of imported raw materials continued to increase with 27 %
            of the higher import expenditure due to the increase in oil prices. Industrial production began
            to fall. Foreign investment in shares fell from US$1.5 billion in 2006 to US$97 million.

           These events have led to Pakistan’s highest current account deficit ever, amounting to 8.6 %
            of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (June 2008).

            Table 1
                                                                  2007             2008             2009
                                                                                                (estimated)
            Real GDP growth (%)                                    6.0              5.8             4.4
            Current account balance (% of GDP)                    –5.7             –8.6           –8.3
            Exchange rate (Pakistani rupees to US$)               61               66             64
            Consumer price inflation (%)                           7.6             19              11

           What is the government doing? The new budget (2008–2009) aims to reduce the budget deficit
            from 7 % of GDP to 4.7 % (by raising tax revenue and reducing government expenditure).
            It will also introduce tariffs and quotas. While the introduction of tariffs could help reduce the
            twin deficits (budget deficit and current account deficit), it could reduce consumer welfare and
            lead to an inefficient allocation of resources.

           The government is preparing a plan aimed at increasing foreign exchange earnings through
            export-led growth. The intention is to diversify production and exports in industries in which
            Pakistan has a comparative advantage, making better use of the country’s abundant labour
            supply and natural resources.

                                         Ireland economy faces slowdown

           The Irish economy has performed well over the past decade, with Irish per capita income
            growth above the European Union (EU) average. Economic activity has been a result of strong
            domestic demand but this is now falling.

           The effects on Ireland’s labour market of a deep slump in the construction sector,
            in particular, are increasing. Employment fell by 26 800 in 2007, equivalent to 9.5 % of the
            sector’s workforce.

           The sharp fall in job numbers has led to an increase in the number of people who
            are unemployed. In the second quarter of 2008, the number of unemployed people increased
            by 15.2 % (compared to the same period in 2007) and the unemployment rate increased
            to 5.2 %.

           The fiscal position of Ireland has deteriorated rapidly since recording a healthy budget
            surplus of 3 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2006. Ireland is now expected to
            record a budget deficit of 5.8 % of GDP in 2008 as the economy slows. It is likely to increase
            further if the government implements expansionary demand-side policies such as increased
            government spending and decreased taxation.

           The government, trade unions and businesses have been unable to agree on a new national
            minimum wage deal. The minimum wage is an example of a minimum price (price floor).
            Trade unions have rejected a 5 % pay increase over 21 months, after seeking a 5 % increase
            per year and a minimum wage for lower paid workers. Some economists argue that allowing
            an increase in the minimum wage will worsen the unemployment problem.

           Some economists have argued that greater labour market flexibility is needed to improve
            Ireland’s unemployment problem. This could include supply-side policies such as abolishing
            the minimum wage, decreasing the power of trade unions and reducing unemployment
            benefits.

           Economists are divided on whether the government should stimulate economic activity
            using demand-side policies or instead focus on supply-side policies that concentrate on
            labour market reforms.

                                              India faces rising currency

           The Indian economy has performed remarkably well in the past 10 years, achieving levels
            of growth only beaten by China. However, India is not without problems including rural
            poverty and the lack of infrastructure, which threaten to limit the gains from economic growth.
            Now the strength of the Indian economy and its attractiveness to foreign investors is causing
            a new and unexpected problem – a rising currency. This week the Indian rupee reached its
            highest value against the US$ since 1998.

           During 2007, foreign investment into India increased by more than 80 % to a record
            US$44 billion. India is an attractive place for investment because it is a developing economy
            with the potential for future economic growth. The relatively cheap labour available in India
            makes it an attractive place for manufacturing and call centres. For these reasons, the Indian
            rupee has appreciated 15 % against the US$ in the past year.

           While large capital inflows are beneficial for the economy, the rising currency may cause
            increasing hardship for exporters, especially India’s labour-intensive manufacturing industries.
            Exports account for 10 % of the US$854 billion economy and the government is counting on
            strong exports to support economic growth in India. India’s economy expanded by 9.2 % in the
            past year, the highest growth rate in two decades.

           The nation’s largest computer-services provider, said the Indian rupee’s “drastic’’ gains will
            reduce earnings by over US$7 billion. The Federation of Indian Exporters says “the currency
            is overvalued and we are asking the government to intervene’’.

           India’s central bank, which sold a record US$11.9 billion Indian rupees in February in a bid to
            slow the currency’s gains, is, however, also concerned about India’s rising inflation rate.

           The Reserve Bank of India is torn between the need to contain inflation, which accelerated at
            7 % in February, the fastest pace for more than two years, and the need to limit the appreciation
            of the currency. To reduce inflation, one policy response is to increase interest rates but this is
            likely to further strengthen the Indian rupee.

                                             Vietnam’s changing economy

           Vietnam has achieved an impressive turnaround in its agricultural sector. Whereas in the
            mid-1980s the country was on the verge of famine, today it is the second-largest rice exporter
            in the world. In addition, it produces and exports a variety of farm, fishery and forest products,
            though these activities are not always consistent with sustainable development.

           Important factors behind the success of Vietnam’s agriculture were privatization of farms
            and equitable distribution of land ownership, stabilization of the economy in the mid-1980s,
            liberalization (freeing) of farm prices and its policies based on free trade.

           Vietnam’s economic transformation is often measured in terms of the declining share of
            the agricultural sector in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the corresponding increase
            in the shares of the industrial sector and the service sector. Where the primary sector
            (agriculture, forestry and fisheries) used to provide over two-thirds of all jobs 10 years ago,
            now it provides only about half of all jobs.

           Until recently, the government and international agencies were advising Vietnamese farmers
            to diversify their production, partly by moving towards non-farm industries, and partly by
            diversifying crops within agriculture. An example of the diversification suggested is the
            development of “craft industries” producing simple homespun products and tourism that
            would bring rich tourists who would buy these products. However, in recent months there
            have been rapid increases in rice prices due to increases in world demand for rice. This would
            provide large benefits for rice farmers. The government is now concerned that diversification
            has gone too far, as some rice farmers have already switched out of rice production.

           In the long term, Vietnam may face a far more serious danger. Scientists predict a rise in the
            sea levels along its coast that by the year 2100 could submerge one-eighth of its land area,
            as well as give rise to extreme weather conditions. As most of Vietnam’s agricultural land
            and population are near the sea, such developments would be highly destructive to the country
            and its economy.
