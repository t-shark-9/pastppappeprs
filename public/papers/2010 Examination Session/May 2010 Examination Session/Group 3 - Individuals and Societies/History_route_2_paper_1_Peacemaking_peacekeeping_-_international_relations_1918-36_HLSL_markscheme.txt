1.    (a)   What, according to Source A, was the significance of Article 16 of the
            Covenant of the League of Nations?                                                                      [3 marks]

               Article 16 expressed the principle of collective security by stating that an act
               of war against a member state was to be interpreted as an act of war against
               all others;
               It stipulated the different sanctions which members resorting to war could face and
               the measures member states were to take against aggressors;
               It determined that the Council could request military contributions from member
               states to protect the covenants of the League.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source C?                                                               [2 marks]

               Mussolini is willing to go to war. This can be supported by reference to the fact that
               he  is  following  the  road  sign  “To  war”  or  by  comments  about  his  strong appearance
               or decisive pace;
               Mussolini’s  disregard  for  the  Covenant  of  the League of Nations is expressed in the
               words written on the document he is holding as well as the way in which he holds it;
               The Abyssinian Crisis has unleashed devastation and death. This can be supported
               by   reference   to   the   skulls   under   the   sign   “To   war”   or   the   flames   and   smoke   in   the  
               background.

      Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about British
     policy during the Abyssinian Crisis.                                                [6 marks]

     For “compare”
       Both sources refer to the fear that Italy might wage war against Britain;
       Both refer to the need to appeal to other League  of   Nations’  members   to support Britain
       and France;
       Both depict Britain as the nation most prepared to deal with the situation in Abyssinia.

     For “contrast”
       While Source B depicts Britain as committed to the League of Nations; Source D says
       Britain failed to lead;
       Source D refers to Britain’s unwillingness to apply oil sanctions on Italy; Source B does
       not mention sanctions explicitly;
       The tone in Source D is critical of the policy of Britain during the Abyssinian Crisis;
       Source B mentions hope that the policy might be effective.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are
     discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum
     [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source D and Source E for historians studying the Abyssinian Crisis.              [6 marks]

     Source D
     Origin:        Extract from a book written by a British soldier who was in Africa at the time
                    of the crisis published in 2004.

     Purpose:       To analyse League of Nations’  policy  on  Abyssinia. To criticize British policy
                    during the crisis.

     Value:         The fact that the author lived and fought in Africa could have given him an
                    additional insight into the situation in the years prior to the war, when the
                    Abyssinian Crisis developed. The date of publication may suggest the
                    opportunity to look at events in retrospect.

     Limitations:   The author is very critical of British policy in Abyssinia and the tone of the
                    extract may indicate a certain partiality. The book focuses on the history of
                    Africa beyond the Abyssinian Crisis, so an abbreviated treatment of the events
                    may be expected. Gold Coast (Ghana) is on the other side of Africa
                    to Abyssinia.

     Source E
     Origin:        Speech by Haile Selassie, Emperor of Abyssinia, to the League of Nations,
                    June 1936.

     Purpose:       To demand the support of the League of Nations in the Abyssinian Crisis.
                    To emphasize the fact that members of the League were not acting according to
                    the Covenant. To explain that collective security was at stake.

     Value:         It is a speech given by Haile Selassie the Emperor of Abyssinia at the height of
                    the conflict. Who was in a position to be aware of the tensions and the impact
                    of  League’s  policy.

     Limitations:   The speech aims at prodding the League of Nations into action to protect
                    Abyssinia. The tone is emotional.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and
     each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is
     assessed mark out of [4 marks]. For maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to origin
     and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, assess the reasons why the
     League  of  Nations’  policy  of  collective  security  was  difficult  to  apply  in  the  
     Abyssinian Crisis.                                                                                   [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    Article 16 shows that the League of Nations could only make recommendations
                  for military action to be used to protect the Covenant.

     Source B:       The source mentions a situation of gravity in Europe and identifies Mussolini
                     as   a   “mad   dog”;;   opposing   him   could   bring   war   upon   Europe.   Except for
                     Britain, other countries had made no preparations for war.

     Source C:       The   cartoon   emphasizes   Mussolini’s   determination   to   go   to   war   and   ignore  
                     the League.

     Source D:       The extract refers to British and French reluctance to break with Mussolini, as
                     he was seen as a necessary ally against Hitler. As in B, the fear of war is
                     provided as another reason. Also,  the  fact  that  the  League’s  sanctions  against  
                     Italy did not include oil is put forward as an explanation as to  why  the  League’s  
                     policy did not succeed in protecting Abyssinia. The source explains that the
                     League’s   policies   were   difficult   to   apply   with   the   lack   of   British   support,  
                     despite the fact that other nations were not backward in imposing sanctions.

     Source E:       The speech refers to the fact that three powers considered their undertakings
                     under the Covenant as of no value. Article 16 and collective security seem to
                     be of little meaning to member states.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: additional material on the importance for Britain and France
     to maintain the Stresa Front (1935) with Italy, on sanctions against Italy – which were finally
     cancelled in July 1936; British and French negotiations outside the League of Nations, such as
     the Hoare-Laval Pact, which showed the League was being sabotaged from within; details
     supporting the fact that Britain and France considered themselves unprepared to go to war, as
     their economies were still recovering from the Great Depression.

     Do not expect all of the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or
     own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect arguments, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
