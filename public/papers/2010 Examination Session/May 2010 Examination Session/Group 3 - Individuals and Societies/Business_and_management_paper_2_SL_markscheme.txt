                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   Outline the purpose of the mission statement of Natura Cosméticos.                   [4 marks]

           Mission statements are brief statements of the purpose of a company or
           organization. They are intended to guide the actions of the organization.
           Mission statements spell out an organization’s overall goals and provide a sense
           of direction and a guide to decision making for all levels of management.

           For Natura Cosméticos, its mission statement provides the same kind of guidance
           that mission statements are intended to. Whenever managers or even ordinary
           employees face a decision, whether strategic, tactical, or even operational,
           Natura Cosméticos’ mission statement can serve as a practical frame of
           reference for the decision. As is often the case, and especially so in the case of
           Natura Cosméticos, the organization’s brand in the marketplace is firmly
           connected to the ideas embedded in the mission statement. Were the organization
           to make decisions not in the spirit of its mission statement, over time its brand
           would probably suffer.

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           [1 mark]
           The candidate provides a general statement of what a mission statement is.

           [2 to 3 marks]
           The candidate details several aspects of a mission statement. If the candidate
           makes no reference to Natura Cosméticos, award no more than [2 marks].

           [4 marks]
           The candidate provides a detailed outline of the purpose of the mission statement
           of Natura Cosméticos.

     (b)   From the profit and loss accounts provided:

           (i)   calculate the missing values X for 2006 and 2007.                             [2 marks]

                 Cost of goods sold: 992
                 Gross profit: 1909
                 Expenses: 1265
                 Net profit before interest and tax: 678


                 Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

                 Award [1 mark] for up to two errors.
                 Award [2 marks] for all calculations correct.
                                        –6–               M10/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(ii)   calculate the gross profit margin and the net profit margin for 2006 and
       2007.                                                                    [4 marks]

                                   2006        2007
        Gross profit margin       68.2 %      68.2 %
        Net profit margin          23 %       21.7 %


       Award [1 mark] for each correct calculation.

(iii) comment on the change in interest between 2006 and 2007.                           [2 marks]

       Interest rose 164.7 % in 2007, from 34 to 90. This increase in interest is
       almost certainly connected to the increase in long-term debt to finance the
       new manufacturing plant.


       If the candidate only lists absolute figures (interest increases from 34 to 90)
       award [0 marks].

       If the candidate only states percentage increase (164.7 %) award [1 mark].

       For [2 marks] there must be commentary in addition to some statement
       regarding the change in interest.

       Award [1 mark] if the candidate comments that interest rose significantly.

       Award [2 marks] if the candidate comments on the fact that interest rose
       significantly and makes the connection between the increase in
       long-term debt to finance the new manufacturing plant and the response
       correctly states the percentage increase in interest.
                                             –7–              M10/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Distinguish between the purpose of accounts for one internal stakeholder
      group of Natura Cosméticos and the purpose of accounts for one external
      stakeholder group.                                                       [3 marks]

      The purpose of accounts for internal stakeholders is to manage the business, that
      is to have quantitative data to support decision making. For example, an increase
      in accounts receivable turnover, which is calculated based upon accounts, could
      lead management to change its credit policy or change its collection procedures.
      For external stakeholders, the purpose of accounts is to make evaluative
      judgments that would inform the external stakeholders relationship to the
      business. For example, an increase in the accounts payable turnover at the
      business might lead some suppliers to reduce their credit exposure to the firm.

      A shareholder can be considered as an internal or external stakeholder.

      Accept any other relevant answer.


      Award [1 mark] for an explanation of how a stakeholder may make use of
      accounts. The candidate may have made no reference to the stimulus material, or
      the explanation may not be fully clear.

      Award [2 marks] for a vague distinction between the purpose of accounts for one
      internal and one external stakeholder. The candidate may not have selected
      stakeholders relevant to Natura Cosméticos, or may not have made reference to
      Natura Cosméticos, or the differences may not be fully clear.

      Award [3 marks] for a clear distinction (the differences) between the purpose of
      accounts for one internal and one external stakeholder. The candidate has
      selected stakeholders relevant to Natura Cosméticos and made references to the
      stimulus material.
                                           –8–             M10/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Examine two reasons why organizations such as Natura Cosméticos set ethical
      objectives.                                                                 [5 marks]

      Organizations such as Natura Cosméticos often establish ethical objectives
      because of certain benefits such as:
      • consumers often view ethical organizations favourably
      • organizations find it easier to recruit and retain employees
      • employees are often more motivated
      • it reduces negative publicity from pressure groups
      • it reduces the risk government will increase regulation and oversight
      • it can help develop a brand image distinguishing it from its competitors.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no examination, award a
      maximum of [3 marks]. If only one reason is examined award a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      To achieve the top markband the candidate must provide a thorough examination
      of two reasons why organizations such as Natura Cosméticos consider setting
      ethical objectives. This could be an expansion of the bullet points above.
      The response reflects detailed knowledge and understanding of ethical objectives
      in business.

      Accept any other relevant examination.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                                    –9–              M10/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    non-profit organization.                                                           [2 marks]

                  A non-profit organization is an organization that does not distribute its
                  surplus funds to owners or shareholders, but instead uses them to pursue
                  its goals. Many non-profit organizations are charities; others include trade
                  unions and public arts organizations. Although many government agencies
                  meet this definition, in most instances they are not considered non-profits.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   overheads                                                                          [2 marks]

                  Overheads are indirect expenses that are not chargeable to a particular part
                  of work or production. Typically overheads are items such as accounting
                  fees, advertising, depreciation, insurance, interest, legal fees, rent, repairs,
                  supplies, taxes, telephone bills, travel and utilities costs.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Calculate for fee-paying patients in 2007 at Aravind Eye Care (Show all your working):

           (i)    the contribution to fixed costs of each fee-paying patient                         [2 marks]

                  Contribution = selling price − variable cost
                  Contribution = US$60 − US$20
                  Contribution = US$40


                  Award [1 mark] for the correct workings and [1 mark] for the correct
                  calculation.
                                       – 10 –           M10/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(ii)   the break-even quantity                                                 [2 marks]

       The break-even quantity occurs when total costs equal total revenue.

       Total costs = Total revenue, where
       Total costs = Fixed costs + variable costs
       Variable costs = quantity sold × US$20
       AND
       Total revenue = price x quantity sold
          FC + Q × US$20 = Q × 60
       3 000 000 + 20Q = 60Q
               3 000 000 = 40Q
                  75 000 = Q


       Award [1 mark] for the correct workings and [1 mark] for the correct
       calculation.

(iii) the margin of safety.                                                    [2 marks]

       Fee-paying quantity per year – break-even quantity = margin of safety
       100 000 – 75 000 = 25 000

       Margin of safety = 25 000


       Award [1 mark] for the correct workings and [1 mark] for the correct
       calculation.

       to receive [1 mark]. Just labelling the axis with a US$ sign is insufficient for
       a mark.

       [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.

       [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total costs curve.

       [1 mark] for either identification of the break-even level of output or the value of
       the break-even level of output.

       Award [0 marks] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than
       [3 marks] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to scale.

(d)   With reference to appropriate content theory, examine two factors that could
      influence the motivation of doctors at Aravind Eye Care.                     [5 marks]

      Candidates should refer to and apply appropriately any of the standard content
      theories addressed in a standard-level course (Taylor, Maslow, McGregor and
      Herzberg) and might consider the factors below (and any other appropriate
      factors).

      For example, according to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, after social needs have
      been met individuals want recognition, such as the award from the Bill & Melinda
      Gates Foundation, which honoured all employees but especially the doctors at
      Aravind Eye Care. After the need for recognition, according to Maslow, people
      have the opportunity to self-actualize (to feel complete and valid), which for
      medical doctors might well be achieved by providing medical care to the poor.

      Factors potentially influencing doctors’ motivation positively may include:
      • the focus on surgery alone – specialization could enhance doctors’ skills as
        surgeons
      • providing an important medical service to many of India’s poor
      • freedom from other responsibilities, some of which may be bureaucratic or
        unfulfilling
      • recognition (such as the award from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation)
      • gaining concrete experience/immersion in a cost-effective way to provide
        health services to the poor – a learning opportunity.

      Factors potentially influencing doctors’ motivation negatively may include:
      • by only doing surgery, doctors’ work could become routine or they could fear
        lack of development of other skills
      • lesser opportunity to develop relationships with patients
      • lesser autonomy than doctors in traditional eye clinics
      • 24 hour-a-day operations require doctors to work non-traditional hours for
        surgeons
      • because Aravind Eye Care is a non-profit organization, doctors’ compensation
        might be lower than working in a for-profit clinic or hospital.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      To achieve the top markband the candidate must provide a thorough examination
      of factors that might affect the motivation of doctors. The response reflects
      detailed knowledge and understanding of motivational theory, to which the
      candidate refers to explicitly, appropriately, and meaningfully.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

                                               SECTION B

3.   (a)   Define the term secondary sector.                                                    [2 marks]

           Unlike the primary sector, which involves the extraction of raw materials from the
           earth or the growing of food or the tertiary sector, which involves the service
           industry, the secondary sector of the economy includes those economic activities
           like manufacturing and construction that create a finished, usable product. In the
           secondary sector, raw materials are transformed into finished goods.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above. Key concept: manufacturing.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Prepare a PEST analysis for the textile factory in Alumbre.                          [6 marks]

           Factors in a PEST analysis of Alumbre’s textile factory might include:

           Political
           • agreement of Peruvian government to help fund improvements in
             communication between Alumbre and the rest of Peru
           • Spanish government’s response to the economic crisis.

           Economic
           • regional economic development as a result of Ecosoluciones
           • new jobs created as a result of Ecosoluciones
           • economic crisis in Europe.

           Social
           • remote village where people are unfamiliar with modern technologies.

           Technological
           • development of economically viable wind generators.

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           If a candidate answers that PEST stands for Political, Economic, Social and
           Technological but otherwise does not develop their response further correctly
           award [1 mark].

           Award [1 mark] for each appropriate and correct entry in the PEST analysis up
           to [6 marks]. All four categories must be addressed for top marks.
                                            – 14 –           M10/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Contrast the objectives of non-profit organizations such as Ecosoluciones to
      those of profit-based organizations.                                         [5 marks]

      Unlike profit-based organizations, which ultimately all have the goal of making
      profits for owners/investors, non-profit organizations such as Ecosoluciones exist
      solely to provide programs and services that are of public benefit. For example,
      one objective of Ecosoluciones is to introduce a non-polluting source of
      electricity. Often such services are not otherwise provided by governments.

      Like profit-based organizations, non-profit organizations can, in some sense,
      earn a profit. However, unlike profit-based organizations, non-profit “profits” are
      really surpluses that must be retained for the future provision of programs
      and services.

      Effective non-profit endeavors have a commitment to management. At one time,
      many non-profits were not seriously concerned with effective management,
      which was often viewed as too closely related to business and, thus,
      commercial interest. Today, most non-profits have learned that they need
      management even more than business does, precisely because they lack the
      discipline of the free market. The non-profits are still dedicated to “doing good,”
      but they also realise that good intentions are no substitute for organization
      and leadership, for accountability, performance, and results. Those require
      management and that, in turn, begins with the organization’s mission.

      Accept any other relevant contrast.


      To achieve [4 marks], a candidate must mention one of the two ideas below;
      to achieve [5 marks], a candidate must have both ideas below:
      • A non-profit organization must pay attention to the fact that they cannot spend
         an infinite amount of money. It must make a “profit”, which it will retain for
         its organization’s purpose, or break-even.
      • Non-profit organizations have a commitment to managing their organization
         well (for example in line with their mission statement and with “doing good”).

      To achieve the top markband the candidate provides a thorough contrast of the
      objectives of non-profits, such as Ecosoluciones and profit-based organizations.
      The response reflects detailed knowledge and understanding of the objectives of
      profit-based and non-profit organizations.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss two possible areas of conflict between stakeholders in the Alumbre
      Project.                                                                   [7 marks]

      The Alumbre Project has the potential to have a transformative impact on
      Alumbre, Peru, and the surrounding area. With change, however, some people
      may benefit and some people may suffer.

      For example, with the introduction of electric-powered machinery in the textile
      factory, productivity rose dramatically, a clear benefit to the owners of the factory
      (one stakeholder). However, automatization may have also meant that the
      traditional skills of the workers (another stakeholder group) related to the
      hand-production of cloth were devalued (proletarianization), thereby weakening
      their control over the workplace or their bargaining position.

      A second area of conflict could stem from issues of Ecosoluciones’ long-term
      commitment to the Alumbre Project. Although initially there was alignment of
      interests between the owners of the textile factory (one stakeholder), the Peruvian
      government (another stakeholder) and Ecosoluciones (a third), the latter’s
      indication that it may no longer maintain Alumbre’s wind generators is a major
      source of potential conflict: the factory owners have invested in electric-powered
      machinery while their source of power is now threatened, and the Peruvian
      government may now need to provide the maintenance service for which it had
      been counting on Ecosoluciones. Workers (another stakeholder) may also be
      dissatisfied, especially the newly hired, as they modified their economic lives to
      work in the textile factory, which is now threatened.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      There are many other potential areas of conflict. Examiners should evaluate them
      based upon their relevance to and basis in the stimulus material. If the response
      is a one-sided relevant approach with no discussion, award a maximum of
      [4 marks]. If the candidate discusses only one possible area of conflict between
      the stakeholders in the Alumbre Project, award a maximum of [4 marks].

      To achieve [4 marks] or more candidates must discuss two issues and clearly
      identify two stakeholders per issue.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

4.   (a)   Identify two features of a sole trader.                                               [2 marks]

           Features of a sole trader may include:
           • A type of business that legally has no separate existence from its owner
           • There is unlimited liability: all debts of the business are debts of the owner.
             The person who sets up the business has sole responsibility for its debts.
           • The business has no partners.
           • A sole proprietorship essentially refers to one person (individual) doing
             business in his or her own name and in which there is only one owner.
           • A sole proprietor may do business with a trade name other than his or her
             legal name.
           • Accept any other relevant feature of a sole trader.


           Award [1 mark] for each appropriate feature of a sole trader that the candidate
           identifies, up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Comment on two appropriate sources of finance which Elena Rudaki might
           have used to set up her distribution centre.                           [6 marks]

           For someone such as Elena Rudaki, the question of finance is challenging.
           Because the organization is a start-up, she has no internal source of funds. Thus,
           she must rely on external sources of funds, either debt or equity. In terms of
           equity, she could use personal savings or take on a partner, someone who has the
           resources to fund or share the cost of starting up the business. Borrowing money
           is another option: she could borrow funds from a bank or another institution that
           has an interest in seeing small organizations get started and succeed, such as
           Coca-Cola itself or the government. She could also try to get a grant from the
           regional government.

           Even though specific sources of finance are not mentioned in the stimulus,
           candidates are still capable of answers that represent application to the stimulus.
           Internal sources are NOT appropriate, and many external sources would not fit the
           circumstances. A bank term loan would NOT be appropriate, as she has no
           collateral. Nor, given the scale of the business, would be conversion to a private
           limited company and selling shares.

           Thorough appropriate comments might include the availability of the type of
           source of finance and/or its limitation (taking on a partner might mean losing
           some control over the business).

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           Award [0 marks] if candidate only mentions a bank loan. However, if the
           candidate identifies a bank loan as a source of finance and “clearly explains”
           why it is not an appropriate source, award [1 mark]. Candidates may suggest
           borrowing from family and friends as a source of finance; for further marks they
           must provide an appropriate commentary why it is appropriate.

           Mark as 3+3.

      For each appropriate source of finance, award [1 mark] for its identification,
      [2 marks] for partial, appropriate comments, and [3 marks] for thorough,
      appropriate comments. Maximum award [6 marks].

(c)   Examine two problems that other entrepreneurs in Elena Rudaki’s town
      may face if they start up a new business.                            [5 marks]

      Generally, a business may face a number of issues when starting up. A partial list
      of potential issues may include determination of:
      • the basic business idea (the product or service)
      • the market and its features
      • the human resources the organization will need
      • the target market of the product or service
      • the suppliers
      • the business location
      • how to raise the initial funds to open the business
      • the most cost effective means to produce the product or service
      • the main risks involved in the business
      • the record keeping procedures for the business.

      Many of these issues would be more complicated in Tajikistan, which is among
      the poorest countries in this region of Asia and is still suffering from the effects of
      a civil war from 1992 to 1997 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For
      example, these entrepreneurs would have difficulty with obtaining supplies and
      delivering products because of the lack of quality infrastructure. If horse-drawn
      carts are a relevant form of transportation, it suggests that the economy is not
      particularly modern and there may be other business issues complicated by lack of
      modern technologies.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no examination, award a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      If the candidate assumes that the other entrepreneur/s is opening a Coca-Cola
      distributorship in Elena’s town award a maximum [3 marks] for a high quality
      answer. Marks [1–3] should be awarded according to the quality of the answer.

      To achieve the top markband the candidate must provide a thorough examination
      of two problems that other entrepreneurs in Elena’s town may face when setting
      up a new business. The response reflects detailed knowledge and understanding
      of starting up a business.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss the effectiveness of the different types of distribution channels for
      Coca-Cola in Tajikistan.                                                      [7 marks]

      There are two types of distribution channels available to Coca-Cola in Tajikistan:
      • a short channel of delivering small orders directly to retail outlets
      • a long channel through intermediaries such as distribution centres.

      Short channel distribution centres means that Coca-Cola either directly controls
      its distribution channels or is working with large-scale distributors or even
      independent Coca-Cola bottlers, part of whose agreement with Coca-Cola is
      distribution. This type of distribution generally means a large business with
      competent management, access to needed finance and sophisticated delivery
      equipment (lorries). However, firms this large may have neither the local
      knowledge to penetrate the remote markets as in Elena Rudaki’s small town, just
      as large short channel distributors may not have the interest, either, in penetrating
      these markets, which are relatively small.

      Long channel distribution such as reliance on people like Elena solves several of
      these problems. For Elena, the small markets in her region of Tajikistan
      represents a real business opportunity. She knows the market and probably has
      limited options for owing her own business. She doesn’t, however, have many
      resources or, probably, formal business skills. To reach these markets, Coca-Cola
      must provide her with considerable support.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      To achieve the top markband the candidate’s response demonstrates a detailed
      knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of the two types of distribution
      channels available to Coca-Cola in Tajikistan. The candidate effectively uses
      business and management terminology throughout. The response includes
      judgments and/or conclusions that are well supported and underpinned by a
      balanced analysis.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

5.   (a)   Outline briefly the difference between market orientation and product
           orientation.                                                          [2 marks]

           Market orientation is one that allows the wants and needs of customers and
           potential customers to drive all the organization’s strategic decisions.
           The organization’s corporate culture is systematically committed to creating
           customer value. The rationale is that the more a company understands and meets
           the real needs of its consumers, the more likely it is to have happy customers who
           come back for more, and tell their friends. Product orientation is an approach to
           business that places the main focus of attention upon the production process and
           the product itself. The rationale is that the unique selling proposition of the
           organization is centred on the special features of the product.

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           Award [1 mark] for a basic response that indicates some understanding of the
           difference. Award [2 marks] for a full clear brief outline of the primary
           difference between market orientation and product orientation.

(b)   Comment on the appropriateness of “surveys, focus groups and interviews”
      as methods of primary market research for Bajaj.                         [6 marks]

      Surveys involve questionnaires, which typically have open and closed questions.
      Questionnaires are often mailed to customers (postal survey) or the consumer fills
      it out at the business location. Focus groups involve groups of customers being
      brought together on one or a number of occasions, where customers and
      consumers are asked to answer and discuss questions related to the product or
      service. Interviews involve obtaining information from one person face-to-face.
      The interviewer rather than the person being interviewed records responses to
      questions, which often contain more open than closed questions.

      Surveys are relatively inexpensive, have no interviewer bias, and can yield
      information on many people covering a wide geographic area. Consumers,
      however, often will not fill out questionnaires, or they fill them out in haste, not
      considering carefully their responses. If the questions are poorly worded, the
      questionnaire may be misleading or produce inaccurate results. Focus groups,
      while relatively inexpensive, often involve only a small number of customers who
      may not reflect the views of the market or market segment in which the business
      is interested. Interviews allow for detailed knowledge. Long or difficult
      questions can be explained, and many of the interviewee’s responses can be used.
      Follow up or tag questions can be asked. However, interviews are time
      consuming and can be expensive. Moreover, the interviewer may have a bias that
      influences the responses of the interviewee.

      For Bajaj, these types of market research techniques are appropriate. Bajaj
      considers itself a market-oriented company, so it needs to understands the wants
      and needs of its customers, who vary. The surveys allow Bajaj to get input from a
      large number of customers at a relatively low cost. Once preliminary ideas are
      developed from this information, Bajaj can get more in-depth information from
      focus groups. Focus groups also have the advantage that participants can learn
      from other participants, which can influence subsequent input. Finally, a select
      number of interviews can be done to obtain detail knowledge. These details can
      either be “positive”, in the sense that Bajaj can hear interviewees discuss what
      they want, or “negative”, in the sense that Bajaj can learn in detail interviewees’
      concerns.

      Market research is especially important because many of Bajaj’s products are sold
      in remote areas where service is difficult. Getting customer input about quality,
      reliability, and safety get help Bajaj shape its product to meet these priorities.
      Also, because Bajaj serves many markets outside of India, they need to have a
      keen understanding of local circumstances in each market. Consumers’ needs,
      wants, and priorities in India may be quite different from consumers’ needs,
      wants, and priorities in other markets and countries.

      As increasing numbers of consumers around the world possess portable
      telephones, Bajaj may want to consider alternates types of market research
      techniques, such as computer-aided telephone interviews, which can be highly
      cost effective and reach a large number of customers.

      Accept any other relevant answer.

(c)   Analyse the usefulness of market segmentation and consumer profiles for
      Bajaj.                                                                  [5 marks]

      Market segmentation involves determination of a segment of the market sharing
      one or more characteristics that cause them to have similar product and/or service
      needs. A market segment is distinct from other segments, is largely homogeneous
      within the segment, responds similarly to a market stimulus, and can be reached
      by a market intervention. The term is also used when consumers with identical
      product and/or service needs are divided up into groups so they can be charged
      different amounts.

      A consumer profile is an outline of significant demographic and psychographic
      details about the user of a particular product. Consumer profiles typically include
      the user’s age, marital status, income, education, occupation, sex, area of
      residence, and purchase behaviour patterns. Knowledge of the consumer profile
      is very important in the determination of the marketing mix.

      For Bajaj, market segmentation and consumer profiles play an especially
      important role and are largely the key to Bajaj’s success. By managing its
      marketing mix to specific market segments determined by extensive consumer
      profiles, Bajaj is able to meet the needs of large numbers of consumers in
      diverse markets.

(d)   Evaluate the use of franchising as a growth strategy for Bajaj.                       [7 marks]

      Franchising refers to the method of practicing and using another person’s business
      philosophy. The franchisor grants the independent operator the right to distribute
      its products, techniques, and trademarks for a percentage of gross monthly sales
      and a royalty fee. Various tangibles and intangibles such as national or
      international advertising, training, and other support services are commonly made
      available by the franchisor.

      For Bajaj, there are numerous advantages to franchising:
      • franchising would allow access to investment capital without the need to give
        up control in the process
      • franchising would allow rapid expansion across countries and continents using
        the capital and resources of their franchisees, and Bajaj can earn profits
        commensurate with its contribution to these new markets
      • franchising would provide Bajaj with a distribution network
      • Bajaj would be relieved of many of the mundane duties necessary to start a
        new outlet, such as obtaining the necessary licenses and permits, which, in
        some jurisdictions, are more easily obtained by locally based, owner-operator
        type applicants
      • Bajaj franchisees would have considerable incentive to operate their
        businesses successfully because they have a direct stake in the operation
      • Bajaj would not need to closely scrutinize the day-to-day operations of
        franchisees (compared to directly-owned outlets).

      Disadvantages for Bajaj would include:
      • in any particular area there will be only a small number of people who
        have both the resources and the desire to set up a Bajaj franchise compared to
        the pool of individuals who would be able to competently manage a
        directly-owned business
      • successful franchising would require a thorough vetting process to evaluate the
        limited number of potential franchisees than would be required to hire a
        direct employee. An incompetent manager of a directly-owned outlet can
        easily be replaced, while regardless of the local laws and agreements in place
        removing an incompetent franchisee is much more difficult
      • incompetent franchisees could easily damage the public’s goodwill towards the
        franchisor’s brand by providing inferior goods and services. If a franchisee is
        cited for legal violations, (s)he will probably face the legal consequences alone
        but Bajaj’s reputation could still be damaged.

      Accept any other relevant evaluation.


      To achieve the top markband the candidate’s response demonstrates a detailed
      knowledge and understanding of the potential strengths and limitations for Bajaj
      of expanding through franchising. The candidate effectively uses business and
      management terminology throughout. The response includes judgments and/or
      conclusions that are well supported and underpinned by a balanced evaluation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
