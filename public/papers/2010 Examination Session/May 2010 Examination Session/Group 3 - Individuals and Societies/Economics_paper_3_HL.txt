                                    Rising prices blamed on the “big” supermarkets

           Since 1990, supermarket prices in Australia have risen twice as fast as anywhere else in the
            developed world. An inquiry into supermarket prices has established that consumers are paying
            much more for basic items such as bread, milk, meat and eggs compared to other developed
            countries as shown in Table 1.

            Table 1
                                             Australia             USA              France            Germany               Japan
             Food inflation rate
                                                68 %               46 %               28 %               17 %                 4%
             (1990–2006)

           The inquiry conducted by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission into
            supermarket prices, concluded that the three largest supermarket chains, Coles, Woolworths
            and Franklins, are charging higher prices for their goods and services. They are acting as a
            collusive oligopoly. They are earning abnormal profits (sometimes called supernormal profits
            or economic profits) and are allocating resources inefficiently.

           In opening remarks at the commission, it was said that competition had collapsed at the
            expense of consumers, creating an oligopolistic market structure, where the three largest
            supermarkets control over 80 % of Australia’s food sales, as Table 2 indicates. They are
            also diversifying into other areas such as banking, takeaway food, cut flowers and
            gasoline (petrol).

            Table 2
                                            Australia              USA              France            Germany               Japan
             % share of food
             sales of three largest           80.4 %               21 %               38 %               47 %               17.5 %
             supermarket chains

           Small independent food stores want the government to intervene and not allow the total market
            share of these three supermarket chains to be larger than 75 %, with no supermarket chain
            controlling more than 25 % of the market. Over the last 20 years, many small independent
            food stores have closed due to the extended trading hours of the large supermarkets,
            favourable rental agreements for these large stores, the economies of scale generated by their
            size, and because independent food stores have been bought by the three larger companies.

           The three large supermarket chains claim the existing situation should be maintained because
            of the number of people they employ (173 000 people in Australia), the long-term careers in the
            retail sector they provide and the service businesses they attract to rural parts of Australia.

                                            Moving towards a recession

           Economic performance in the United States (USA), Western Europe and Japan according to
            economic indicators such as the growth of output, investment, employment and wages, has been
            getting worse in each downward phase of the business cycle since 1973. The current cycle in
            the USA, which began in early 2001, has been the worst of all. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
            growth has been the slowest in any comparable cycle since the 1940s; growth in investment
            is down 30 % and the creation of jobs is down 65 %. In addition, hourly wages have not
            increased in real terms since 1979. This forms the background for the current economic
            problems that began in 2007.

           Many economists believe that the USA economy is now in recession. Falling house
            prices have reduced the ability of homeowners to borrow against their property, which
            in turn reduces their ability to spend freely on consumer goods and services. This fall in
            consumer spending has led to businesses hiring less labour in some industries, which has
            further slowed consumer spending. The construction of new homes has fallen, with sales of
            new homes falling even faster, resulting in a large oversupply of homes, which will continue
            to force down prices even more.

           The USA Federal Government is considering tax cuts and additional government spending
            to stimulate the economy, even if this increases the budget deficit. The hope is to encourage
            consumer spending and business investment although this may add to inflationary pressures.
            The chairman of the Federal Reserve (the central bank) in the USA has indicated that he is
            happy to support the use of fiscal policy by lowering interest rates.

           Cuts in indirect taxes and direct taxes affect production costs, disposable income and the
            spending power of consumers, and have an impact on the allocation of resources (factors of
            production). They may also have a psychological effect on investors.

3.       Study the extract and data below and answer the questions that follow.


                                                 Pakistan’s economy

           There was a positive transformation in the Pakistani economy in the early 2000s.
            The exchange rate was allowed to float, exports of primary commodities increased along
            with foreign direct investment and foreign reserves, while government debt fell.

           By 2007, however, Pakistan faced a number of political and economic problems. In addition
            to political instability, there were hailstorms and diseases destroying crops, which led to large
            increases in food imports. The price of imported raw materials continued to increase with 27 %
            of the higher import expenditure due to the increase in oil prices. Industrial production began
            to fall. Foreign investment in shares fell from US$1.5 billion in 2006 to US$97 million.

           These events have led to Pakistan’s highest current account deficit ever, amounting to 8.6 %
            of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (June 2008).

            Table 1
                                                                  2007            2008                2009
                                                                                                  (estimated)
            Real GDP growth (%)                                    6.0             5.8                4.4
            Current account balance (% of GDP)                    –5.7            –8.6              –8.3
            Exchange rate (Pakistani rupees to US$)               61              66                64
            Consumer price inflation (%)                           7.6            19                 11

           What is the government doing? The new budget (2008–2009) aims to reduce the budget deficit
            from 7 % of GDP to 4.7 % (by raising tax revenue and reducing government expenditure).
            It will also introduce tariffs and quotas. While the introduction of tariffs could help reduce the
            twin deficits (budget deficit and current account deficit), it could reduce consumer welfare and
            lead to an inefficient allocation of resources.

           The government is preparing a plan aimed at increasing foreign exchange earnings through
            export-led growth. The intention is to diversify production and exports in industries in which
            Pakistan has a comparative advantage, making better use of the country’s abundant labour
            supply and natural resources.

                                           Vietnam’s changing economy

           Vietnam has achieved an impressive turnaround in its agricultural sector. Whereas in the
            mid-1980s the country was on the verge of famine, today it is the second-largest rice exporter
            in the world. In addition, it produces and exports a variety of farm, fishery and forest products,
            though these activities are not always consistent with sustainable development.

           Important factors behind the success of Vietnam’s agriculture were privatization of farms
            and equitable distribution of land ownership, stabilization of the economy in the mid-1980s,
            liberalization (freeing) of farm prices and its policies based on free trade.

           Vietnam’s economic transformation is often measured in terms of the declining share of
            the agricultural sector in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the corresponding increase
            in the shares of the industrial sector and the service sector. Where the primary sector
            (agriculture, forestry and fisheries) used to provide over two-thirds of all jobs 10 years ago,
            now it provides only about half of all jobs.

           Until recently, the government and international agencies were advising Vietnamese farmers
            to diversify their production, partly by moving towards non-farm industries, and partly by
            diversifying crops within agriculture. An example of the diversification suggested is the
            development of “craft industries” producing simple homespun products and tourism that
            would bring rich tourists who would buy these products. However, in recent months there
            have been rapid increases in rice prices due to increases in world demand for rice. This would
            provide large benefits for rice farmers. The government is now concerned that diversification
            has gone too far, as some rice farmers have already switched out of rice production.

           In the long term, Vietnam may face a far more serious danger. Scientists predict a rise in the
            sea levels along its coast that by the year 2100 could submerge one-eighth of its land area,
            as well as give rise to extreme weather conditions. As most of Vietnam’s agricultural land
            and population are near the sea, such developments would be highly destructive to the country
            and its economy.

           Malawi is one of the world’s least developed countries, with about 85 % of the population living
            in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for more than 30 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
            and 90 % of exports. The economy depends on economic assistance from the International
            Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and individual donor nations.

           The district hospital at Mchinji in Malawi was built nearly 20 years ago to provide basic
            healthcare services to the population. Healthcare services also have major external
            benefits for the economy (positive externalities), such as more productive workers,
            lower absenteeism from work and higher economic growth. The hospital was originally built
            to serve 275 000 people, but now serves 600 000. Malawi has the lowest number of doctors
            per capita in the world.

           Work started recently on a hospital extension. The extension has been paid for by fair trade
            groundnuts, grown in Malawi and sold to British shoppers. This story is being repeated
            throughout Malawi with fair trade revenues being used to improve infrastructure and
            better educational opportunities. Disadvantaged producers and families are benefiting from
            fair trade funds.

           Fair trade is seen as a form of aid. The free market was not providing enough income
            to farmers, but now groundnut farmers receive a guaranteed payment above the world
            equilibrium price for their goods, and use the extra payments to make improvements in
            their communities. Fair trade advocates payment of fair prices and social and environmental
            standards in the production of a wide range of goods. The focus is on exports from
            developing to developed countries, working with very poor producers to help them achieve a
            position of greater economic security and self-sufficiency.

           Fair trade has become one of the fastest growing retail sectors in Great Britain.
            Consumers are spending more than UK£450 million (US$900 million) annually on fair trade
            products.

           Fair trade, however, has its critics. Free market economists argue that by encouraging
            oversupply, fair trade agreements result in the inefficient allocation of resources and may
            drive prices down in the long term. Other critics have pointed out that the major beneficiaries
            of free trade agreements are the large supermarkets rather than the poor producers in
            developing countries.
