    (a)   Essay

          Referring to specific case studies, discuss the factors affecting river flooding. [20 marks]

          A detailed discussion of a limited number of factors might be as successful an approach as
          discussing a larger number of factors in less depth. This is an evaluative question which
          requires candidates to make an appraisal of the factors that cause flooding. The factors
          affecting river flooding include:

           antecedent conditions
           amounts of rainfall and/or duration and intensity of rainfall
           snowmelt
           basin characteristics such as size, shape and relief of catchment, vegetation cover,
            surface permeability
           human impact, e.g. urbanization, afforestation/deforestation, river engineering.

          Stronger answers may acknowledge that these factors can either increase or decrease the
          likelihood of flooding.

          Credit candidates that refer to recent flood events as long as they include “factors”.
          Candidates are expected to discuss the factors responsible for different flood events.
          There should be a clear conclusion as to whether factors are always the same or not.

          Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   Structured question

      (i)    Referring to the graph, describe how particle size changes downstream.         [4 marks]

             In the upper reaches of the river there is a high proportion of coarse and medium load
             and a relatively small amount of fine load. Over a distance of over 1600 km the
             proportion of coarse load decreases whereas the proportion of fine load increases.
             The medium load increases over most of the course but decreases after about 1550 km.
             Award [1 mark] for each of the three statements about the distribution of particle sizes
             downstream and the final [1 mark] for some quantification.

      (ii)   Explain why particle size and shape vary with distance downstream.             [4 marks]

             Credit reduction in particle size [1 mark] and increase in roundness [1 mark].
             The changes in size and shape result from the processes of transport and attrition.
             Award [1 mark] for mentioning each term and [2 marks] for explanation of the
             reduction in particle size and increase in roundness. It is not necessary to mention the
             terms of transport and attrition for full marks.

      (iii) Briefly explain what is meant by the competence of a river.                     [2 marks]

             The competence of a river is the maximum [1 mark] size of particle [1 mark] that a
             river can carry.

      (iv) Referring to examples, compare the issues of water utilization at two
           different scales (local, regional, national or international).        [10 marks]

             The issues of water utilization are likely to vary at different scales, depending on the
             examples chosen. At an international scale, there may be conflict over the amount of
             water each country in a drainage basin is allocated. Political conflicts also apply to
             issues of water quality.

             At a local level, there may be issues over conflicting users such as farmers and
             urban dwellers.

             Water utilization issues at all scales are particularly evident in areas which experience
             water shortages. The issues compared could be political, environmental, recreational,
             social and economic.

             Answers that refer to two different scales and illustrate their work with examples are
             likely to be credited at band D and above.

             Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

A2. Coasts and their management

    Either

    (a)   Essay

          Discuss the causes and effects of changes in sea level on coastlines.               [20 marks]

          This essay requires a description and explanation for the process of sea level change, both rise
          and fall, followed by a discussion of effects.

          Over geological history, sea levels have fallen and risen in response to a sequence of
          glacial episodes. Changes in land level have also resulted in relative changes in sea levels.
          Global warming may cause sea-level change affecting many coastlines and their populations.

          Sea level rise has resulted in gradual coastal inundation and a range of submergent features
          including: rias and fjords. The physical characteristics and formation of these coastlines
          should be explained along with their potential for economic activity. (Deep, sheltered rias
          and fjords present opportunities for navigation, fishing and tourism.) Low-lying coastlines,
          such as those of the Ganges delta and small islands in the Indian Ocean, are particularly
          vulnerable to rising sea-level. In richer societies, coastal protection schemes and insurance
          policies are taken to mitigate against this.

          Falls in sea level result in the features of emergent coastlines such as raised beaches and
          abandoned cliff lines.

          Sea level change on any time scale is relevant (short term and long term) although omitting
          the geological scale and focusing on the effects of recent global warming is likely to be
          self-limiting. To access markbands E and F the answer must cover a range of physical and/or
          human causes and consequences.

          Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   Structured question

      (i)    (a)   Briefly describe the changes in the width of the beach at point A
                   between 1966 and 1984.                                            [2 marks]

                   The beach has become wider [1 mark] by approximately two times / from a width of
                   0.5 to 1 kilometre [1 mark]. An alternative qualifying statement could also be valid.

             (b)   Identify two other ways in which the construction of the airfield
                   has changed the shape of the coastline.                           [2 marks]

                   It has caused recession of the coastline north of the airfield [1 mark], changing the
                   shape of the beach along the side of the airfield [1 mark] and the creation of an
                   indentation south of the resort area [1 mark]. Any two valid points should
                   be credited.

      (ii)   Explain the coastal processes which might have caused the changes you
             have described in (i).                                                [6 marks]

             Answers should explain the accumulation of sediment to the south of the airfield which
             acts as a barrier to longshore transport of sediment northwards. There is also erosion to
             the north of the airfield.

             The airfield causes the build up of sediment on the downdrift side. However, once the
             waves have deposited their load, they are able to pick up (erode) the beach on the
             updrift (north) side of the airfield.

             Credit should be given for an explanation of the retreat of the high water mark towards
             the resort area due to an increase in wave energy resulting in erosion of the shoreline.
             Award [3 marks] for an explanation of the changes north of the airfield and [3 marks]
             for south of the airfield.

      (iii) Referring to examples, examine the physical and human factors which
            determine whether a coastline is protected or not.                  [10 marks]

             The answer should identify more than one management option and these will range
             from ambitious and costly schemes, involving structural engineering, to passive
             approaches of doing nothing. The approach will be dependent upon the urgency and
             scale of the problem and its expected outcomes.

             Physical factors could include:
             The level of risk of erosion and flooding; wave energy; storm frequency and intensity;
             the resilience of the coastline which is determined by its geomorphology, geology and
             exposure to climatic and tectonic hazards; the current rate of recession; the extent to
             which coastal processes can be controlled; natural resources needing conservation;
             the likely environmental outcomes of protection schemes.

Human factors could include:
Population density; coastal land value; coastal land use; amenity and recreational value
of coastal features; national/regional wealth and priorities in spending, as well as the
success or failure of management attempts.

A range of factors, physical and human, need to have been examined to access
bands E/F.

Examples are a specific requirement of the question, and they would be expected in
those answers achieving band D and above.

A3. Arid environments and their management

    Either

    (a)   Essay

          Referring to named and located examples, examine the responses of people to
          the challenges presented by arid and/or semi-arid areas.                    [20 marks]

          Answers must refer to specific named and located areas in arid and/or semi-arid areas.
          The main challenges of such areas should be identified in terms of high temperatures;
          low rainfall; high rates of evaporation; high potential evapotranspiration; seasonal water
          deficit; lack of soil moisture; periodic or long-term drought risks; dry soils; deflation by the
          wind; desertification in semi-arid areas; and remoteness; though not all of these will apply to
          the selected areas.

          It is expected that the main responses to the challenges will involve adaptation of agriculture
          to the lack of water and high temperatures, and may include dam construction,
          irrigation systems, oasis farming, pastoral nomadism or the use of exotic rivers.
          Desalinization of seawater, the development of tourism, solar energy developments and salt
          extraction, and the growth of urban areas are other valid non-agricultural responses.

          Examiners should adopt an open approach to marking as a wide range of approaches
          is possible.

          Answers that use appropriate examples are likely to be credited at band D and above.

(b)   Structured question

      (i)    Define the following terms:                                                 [2+2 marks]

             (a)   hot arid environment,

                   Hot and arid areas experience high daytime and summertime temperatures
                   [1 mark] and a moisture deficit with mean annual precipitation below
                   250 mm [1 mark]. Hot areas with low rain should not be credited without some
                   exemplification of the terms hot and dry. Answers that state „an area where
                   potential evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation‟ should be awarded [2 marks].

             (b)   desertification.

                   The spread of desert-like conditions [1 mark] into neighboring semi-arid
                   regions and/or previously vegetated areas [1 mark].

      (ii)   Referring to the map, suggest three reasons for the location of areas
             with a high risk of desertification.                                  [6 marks]

             The reasons might include:
               proximity to hot arid environments that may expand
               unreliable rainfall
               periodic drought or risk of long-term drought
               poor farming practices such as overgrazing and over-cultivation
               population pressure leading to degradation of vulnerable marginal areas
               deforestation for fuelwood leading to land degradation
             Each of the three reasons should be developed (there may be others), although detailed
             knowledge of African examples is not expected.

      (iii) Examine why the landscape of hot arid environments is so distinctive          [10 marks]

             Answers should show an awareness of the distinctive nature of desert landscapes in
             terms of their characteristics, landforms and vegetation. Their distinctiveness should be
             described and explained with reference to processes and physical features. Wind and
             water should be discussed as agents influencing the development of distinct features of
             distinct landscapes. The effects of periodic storms and flash floods, combined with long
             periods of weathering and high rates of evaporation, create distinctive landscapes.

             Good responses will include a range of characteristic fluvial and aeolian landforms and
             varied landscapes (erg, reg hamada, basin and range, pediment and bajada), though it is
             not necessary to refer to all types in order to reach the top markbands. Answers that do
             not mention vegetation as an element of such landscapes should not be penalized and
             may also reach the top markbands.

             Responses that simply refer to a range of individual features without considering the
             total landscape and its distinguishing (distinctive) features should not move above
             markband D.

             Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     (a)   Essay

           Discuss the factors other than distance from the epicentre, that determine the
           impacts of an earthquake.                                                      [20 marks]

           Reference may be made to physical factors such as geology, topography, depth of focus,
           magnitude and sub-marine earthquakes causing tsunamis. Unconsolidated materials may
           liquefy, steeper slopes may be prone to mass movement, and coastal locations may exacerbate
           the tsunami hazard.

           Other factors that should be taken into consideration include level of development,
           population density, housing quality, property values, insurance, preparedness, the season of
           the year and the time of day. Consideration may be given to both primary and secondary
           impacts.

           Not all of the above are required for an answer to reach band F, but answers should examine
           both physical and human factors. A strong account of one may compensate for a weaker
           account of the other. Answers that only cover one of these aspects should not move above
           band D. Answers that offer explicit exemplification of relevant factors are likely to be
           credited at bands E/F. Although examples are not a specific requirement of the question,
           they would be expected in those answers achieving bands D and above.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

      (i)    Describe the pattern of volcanoes shown on the map.                               [3 marks]

             There is a linear concentration of volcanoes in East Africa and along the southern part
             of the Red Sea (East African rift) [1 mark]. A few volcanoes are found in west central
             Africa (Cameroon) – these also show a linear distribution [1 mark] and a few volcanoes
             are also found dispersed in central northern Africa (Sudan and Chad) [1 mark].
             Credit may also be given for picking out a linear pattern along the western arm of the
             rift in Congo and Rwanda. It is acceptable for candidates to mention clustering without
             necessarily referring to a linear distribution.

      (ii)   Using only an annotated diagram, explain the formation and features of
             constructive plate margins.                                            [7 marks]

             Credit should only be given for information which is either written on the map or linked
             to it by arrows or a key.
             The explanation should cover the physical pressures leading to the formation and
             features of constructive plate margins.
             As a general rule, [3 marks] should be awarded for the quality of the diagram
             and [4 marks] for the quality of the annotations, but this balance can be adjusted in
             cases where exceptional quality is found in either of these (two) parts. The diagram
             may be divided into several parts but some of the following annotations/explanations
             should be incorporated. Constructive margins usually have distinctive ridges at either
             side of a rift valley, formed as a result of the sea floor spreading and tension as the crust
             diverges. Fault lines (normal faults) are found where the central rift has subsided as a
             result of the tension. Shield volcanoes and lava plateau (basic lava) may form along the
             rift system where there are fissures and fracturing. Some reference may be made to the
             depth of the rift. In the case of sub-marine rifts there are smokers (vents issuing gases
             such as SO2), volcanic islands, and in the case of terrestrial rifts (East Africa) there are
             often lakes formed in the lowest areas and a series of stepped escarpments.

             Not all of the above are required in the annotations but at least two should be explained
             in some detail or four in less detail. Accept diagrams of submarine plate margins or
             continental rift valleys.

(iii) “Rapid mass movements cause more problems for people than slow
      mass movements.” Discuss this statement.                       [10 marks]

    Answers should discuss the effects of mass movements of different speeds on people in
    terms of loss of property and life, disruption of communications and economic activity.
    Answers should distinguish clearly between slow and rapid mass movements.
    Examiners should allow some flexibility in how this distinction is made. It is
    anticipated that responses will consider that slow movements, such as soil creep and
    solifluction, cause fewer problems but that they do have effects on people and these
    should be briefly explained.

    Rapid movements are likely to be discussed in terms of their greater effect, and
    responses should point out that the speed of onset and movement reduce predictability
    and result in a more serious impact. Answers could explain this with reference to
    several types of fast movement, though a detailed discussion of a single case study is
    equally acceptable.

    Stronger answers are likely to refer to actual examples of mass movements in order to
    demonstrate their impacts. Answers including snow avalanches as a type of rapid mass
    movement should be credited, as long as conclusions are drawn regarding speed and
    impact. Answers that extend the discussion into problems associated with responses to
    the hazards of mass movements are also valid and should be credited.

    While the question requires that both rapid and slow mass movements be examined, it is
    not necessary for them to be covered in equal depth. Answers that do not refer to both
    should not be credited above band C.

    Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

A5. Ecosystems and human activity

    Either

    (a)   Essay

          Using specific case studies, examine the differences in human impacts upon
          one grassland and one forest ecosystem.                                    [20 marks]

          Two specific ecosystems (or biomes) should be named and located. The emphasis of the
          essay should be placed on an examination of the differences in impacts. These impacts will
          vary according to the chosen case studies but may focus on a variety of pertinent issues.
          For example, in the case of tropical grasslands this may be soil erosion/degradation, loss of
          endemic species, the influence of seasonal burning, conversion to agriculture and other
          possibilities. The forest ecosystem case study may examine deforestation, soil erosion, loss of
          species diversity, extinction, changes in local climate (rainfall) and aesthetic loss
          (for example).

          Stronger answers might also examine positive impacts. These may include land management,
          zoning, reforestation schemes, creation of national parks, biosphere reserves, community
          based tourism (ecotourism), game ranching in tropical grasslands. Many other possibilities

(b)   Structured question

      (i)    Briefly describe the difference between producers and consumers.                [2 marks]

             Producers (autotrophs) are organisms that make their own food, using sunlight such as
             green plants or plankton [1 mark]. Consumers are animals that eat producers
             (autotrophs/plants) or other consumers [1 mark].

      (ii)   Explain the energy flows on the diagram.                                        [3 marks]

             Photosynthesis explains how energy from the sun is captured by green plants and used
             to make food [1 mark]. Most of this energy is used to carry on the plant‟s life activities.
             The rest of the energy is passed on as food to the next level of the food chain [1 mark].
             Therefore only 10 % of energy is passed to the next level of the food chain [1 mark].
             At each level above producers, 90 % of energy is lost through heat (respiration,
             movement reproduction) [1 mark] and through decomposition (excretion, death and
             decay) [1 mark]. Animals located at the top of the food chain need a lot more food to
             meet their energy needs [1 mark]. Three valid points can be credited but they must
             refer to both photosynthesis, or energy capture from the sun, as well as transfer up the
             food chain.

      (iii) Explain how negative and positive feedback affect the stability of an
            ecosystem.                                                            [5 marks]

             When an ecosystem is in balance, it is in a steady state or dynamic equilibrium
             [1 mark]. This is achieved by self-regulation (negative feedback) [1 mark]. As an
             ecosystem is a system, change in one component (positive feedback) will affect other
             components [1 mark]. Negative feedback decreases the amount of change, returning
             the ecosystem to stability [1 mark]. It provides a balance in the system. Positive
             feedback increases the amount of change which leads to an imbalance [1 mark].
             Positive feedback is a type of a vicious circle that perpetuates change. Other valid
             explanations can be credited.

      (iv) Discuss how people can manage a named and located ecosystem to
           increase its sustainability.                                   [10 marks]

             The ecosystem chosen must be named and located. The ecosystem may be natural or
             one altered by people. Specific management practices should be discussed and related
             to increasing the sustainability of the system. Strong responses will show an
             understanding of sustainability and the ways in which the management of the ecosystem
             exemplifies this. Management practices which do this may include afforestation
             projects, sustainable tourism, involvement of the local community in using the
             ecosystem as an extractive reserve, and species and soil conservation. Other valid
             management practices may be included.

          All kinds of impacts on people, property, the economy, society and the environment could be
          considered. Tropical cyclones vary in size, strength and in the path they follow. Each of
          these characteristics will require some explanation and will affect the impacts they will have.
          In addition, the impacts will also depend on the characteristics of the areas affected by the
          cyclones, including population density, wealth, the community‟s state of preparedness,
          accuracy of predictions and warnings, infrastructure for evacuations, search, rescue and
          recovery capabilities, and people‟s memory of the severity of past events. Other valid reasons
          may be credited. Reference may also be made to the possibility that the frequency and
          severity of tropical cyclones are increasing, and may continue to increase in the future, as a
          result of global warming.

          Answers may look at both spatial and temporal variations.

             The ozone layer in question is in the stratosphere [1 mark]; when a hole forms, there is
             a lower concentration of ozone in the layer than normal caused by the impact of ozone
             depleting substances (ODS) for example CFCs. [1 mark]. Accept depletion of ozone

      (ii)   Describe the trend shown by the maps.                                          [2 marks]

             The trend is one of ever decreasing ozone (or ever larger hole in the ozone layer) over
             the Antarctic [1 mark] with a further [1 mark] for some quantification.

      (iii) Explain three effects of the trend identified in (ii).                          [6 marks]

             There are two major concerns about a decrease in stratospheric ozone. The first is that
             more UV radiation will penetrate the atmosphere and reach the ground. Plants and
             animals vary in their tolerance of increases in UV radiation, but many are susceptible to
             a variety of problems if UV radiation exceeds normal levels [2 marks]. Excessive UV
             radiation can damage DNA, the genetic code in every living cell. In people, increases in
             UV radiation have been linked to an increase in aged skin and skin cancers. They have
             also led to a higher incidence of eye cataracts and may weaken the immune system
             [2 marks]. The second major concern about decreasing stratospheric ozone is that the
             same CFCs which are believed to be largely responsible for the destruction of ozone are
             also thought to have a considerable impact on global warming. Other valid effects
             should also be credited [2 marks].

             Award [2 marks] for each effect that is developed in detail and [1 mark] for less
             developed effects.

      (iv) Examine the local, national and international responses to ozone
           depletion.                                                       [10 marks]

             At a local level, the responses may include campaigns to increase the use of sunscreen
             to avoid some of the potentially damaging effects of excessive UV radiation on the skin.
             International responses include: the meetings held in Montreal (1987) which placed
             limits on CFC production; Helsinki (1989) where a complete ban on CFCs was agreed;
             and Copenhagen (1992) where the deadlines for ending the use of CFCs were
             brought forward. Several individual countries, including Germany, Australia, Sweden
             and Canada have introduced legislation that is more stringent than that required by the
             international agreements. Many countries have also enacted national regulations
             designed to encourage the rapid development and production of products to
             replace CFCs.

           Referring to specific examples, discuss whether or not a place may belong to
           more than one region at the same time.                                       [20 marks]

           A place is a single geographical entity, whereas a region is an area of places which share
           some characteristic or characteristics.

           There are many different kinds of region. For example, there are regions based on a single
           physical criterion (such as rainfall or relief) or single cultural criterion (such as language,
           dialect, or religion). Many regions are defined as multi-feature regions, defined by several
           criteria, usually a combination of physical and human characteristics. There are also
           administrative (political) regions and functional regions. The latter are defined either by a
           combination of economic activities, or by the service area for a particular good or service.
           Responses should discuss more than one kind of region; answers which focus on only one
           kind of region may not be credited beyond band D.

           Because there is a multiplicity of regions, depending on how and why they are defined,
           which overlap each other at a variety of scales, all places belong to more than one region at
           the same time. Answers that conclude otherwise may not be credited beyond band D.
           Answers that do not include specific examples of places and regions should not be credited

                  There are many possibilities. Economic, social and additional physical aspects are all
                  appropriate choices, provided they are readily quantifiable and likely to be depicted on
                  maps by isolines.

           (iii) Analyse the contemporary geographical issues of your local region.           [10 marks]

                  The region must be clearly located and defined, and the issues analysed must be
                  contemporary. The region and issues should be accurately described and/or explained.

                  Most contemporary geographical issues are likely to be at least partly due to human,
                  economic or social factors as to physical geography. Some may be due to external
                  factors which the region is unable to control or influence in any meaningful way.

                  The analysis should be based on a single local region. Answers that analyse more than
                  one region will be self-limiting.

          Strategies of urban management aim to improve a number of aspects of urban living.
          These include: housing, communications, environment, waste management, employment,
          security, socio-economic equalities, ethnic assimilation, recreational and open-space
          provision, derelict areas and regeneration. There are other valid strategies that may be cited.

          Candidates should use examples of at least two named towns or cities. The evaluation may be
          speculative if the strategies are of recent implementation. A wide interpretation of
          effectiveness is acceptable, ranging from economic to social, cultural, aesthetic, and
          environmental considerations.

          Strategies may be designed at a variety of levels to cover a range of scales. For instance,
          a national strategy may be to develop new towns or green belts whereas a local one may refer
          to development of an area of low quality housing.

           Examiners should remain flexible in terms of candidates‟ interpretation of “recent” but
           answers may legitimately include the Green Revolution of the 1960s to 1970s. Answers that
           refer to only very recent innovations, such as the GM revolution, are also valid.

           Possible areas of discussion might include improved or innovative irrigation systems,
           high-tech glasshouse cultivation, the use of chemical fertilizers (especially nitrates) and
           pesticides, factory farming and the use of ICT in farming systems, as well as the Green and
           GM Revolutions. Not all of these are essential to a good answer but at least two areas of
           technological innovation should be examined. These may include examples other than those
           mentioned above.

           A variety of scales from local to global could be considered. Benefits and problems may
           range from economic to social and environmental. Benefits and problems that do not directly
           affect people may also be relevant in answers, such as impacts on habitats and
           wildlife populations.

           Benefits may include increased food production, reduced poverty levels, improved social
           welfare, improved health, economies of scale, increased personal and national incomes,
           availability of out of season foods, the control of disease and pest control.

           Problems may include costs, social inequalities, control by TNCs, environmental pollution,
           loss of biodiversity, energy use, dichotomies of wealth, soil erosion, land and
           water degradation, genetic mutation.

           The term “examples” may be interpreted as examples of specific technological innovation or
           examples of named areas where these innovations have been introduced. Either or both of
           these approaches is acceptable.

           Answers must refer to both benefits and problems related to specific innovations. The range

             Answers that simply describe differences in costs without reference to their
             geographical pattern should not be awarded more than [2 marks]. Answers that do not
             quantify labour cost data should not be credited with more than [3 marks].

      (ii)   Using named examples, explain the effects that differences in labour
             costs have on the location of manufacturing industry.                [6 marks]

             Answers should explain why labour costs are such an important factor in industrial
             location since other factors, such as transport, have seen a reduction in time-distance,
             and relative costs and mechanization have reduced the demand for skilled labour in the
             manufacturing process. The availability of cheap labour in many LEDCs has
             encouraged TNCs involved in labour intensive industries to locate manufacturing in
             peripheral low wage manufacturing areas and away from high wage core regions, since
             products can be easily and cheaply moved to distant markets. Examples might refer to
             particular industries such as garments or electrical goods and to specific countries
             and TNCs. Answers that generalize without reference to named examples should not be
             awarded more than [3 marks]. Answers that refer to these processes at a national or
             regional scale rather than a global scale should be credited. At least three developed
             points are expected for the award of the full [6 marks].

      (iii) Examine the factors other than labour costs that influence the location
            of manufacturing industry.                                              [10 marks]

             Valid answers may refer to factors other than labour costs at a variety of scales, from
             local to national to regional to global. Relevant factors could include transport costs,
             type(s) of transport required (road, rail, water, air, pipeline), the influence of raw
             material in terms of weight loss or weight gain, the influence of markets, energy and
             supplies, government policies (special economic zones/tax breaks), land costs,
             behavioural factors associated with individual entrepreneurs and climate.

             Answers accessing band D and above should cover a range of these factors, and are
             likely to refer to specific industries and/or locations to access bands E and F.

             Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

     (a)   Essay

           “Global economic integration has reduced international disparities in
           wealth.” Discuss this statement with reference to examples.           [20 marks]

           An understanding should be shown of the concept of “global economic integration” meaning
           the merging of economic systems and the increase in international flows of goods and finance.
           Its functional mechanisms and features should also be mentioned. They include:
               Free trade encouraged by global institutions such as the WTO, IMF and the World Bank;
               the creation of trading blocs – EU, NAFTA, LAFTA, COMECON
               The growth and dominance of TNCs associated with new international division of labour
               (NIDL) and increasing flows of Foreign Direct Investment
               The improvement in global communications networks facilitating easy flow of people,
               goods, services, capital and ideas and resulting in time-space convergence.

           The issue of reducing disparities should be addressed and the answer may agree, disagree or
           present both arguments. Pro-globalist views are that economies grow and economic disparity
           declines through free trade as exemplified by the NICs of South East Asia. Anti-globalist
           views are that the global economy is dominated by international institutions promoting
           powerful MEDCs and excluding weaker LEDCs. They also argue that the growth of LEDCs
           is hindered by the domination of TNCs, the unfair terms of trade, and the inability to clear
           their debts.

           No credit can be given for comments relating to social or cultural integration.


           To access bands E and F answers should consider both sides of the argument and exemplify
           with examples.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   Structured question

      (i)    Describe two main differences between the graphs.                               [3 marks]

             Differences include the number of tourists, the rate of increase between 2000 and 2008
             (Maldives is greater), date of the anomaly.
             Other valid differences should also be credited. Award [1 mark] for each of two
             differences plus [1 mark] for some quantification. Merely stating the years does not
             count as adequate quantification.

      (ii)   Suggest three possible reasons for the differences you have described in (i).   [3 marks]

             Possible reasons include the promotion of tourism in the Maldives, resulting in a faster
             rate of growth; possibility of a localized political or hazardous event affecting the small
             island nation; possibility of a global crisis in 2002, which did not reach the Maldives;
             the disproportionate size of world tourism numbers compared to the Maldives.

             Award [1 mark] for each of three valid reasons outlined.

      (iii) Explain one positive and one negative impact of a decline in tourist
            arrivals in a small island nation such as the Maldives.              [4 marks]

             Impacts may be social, cultural, economic or environmental.
             Positive impacts might include recovery of coastal ecosystems, relief from air, land and
             water pollution, conservation of resources such as water.

             Negative impacts might include loss of foreign revenue, negative causation (reverse
             multiplier effect), collapse of the national and local economies where tourism makes a
             major contribution to GDP.

             Award [2 marks] for an explanation of each impact.           Specific knowledge of the
             Maldives is not required.

      (iv) Describe and evaluate the attempts that have been made to regenerate a
           named declining tourist destination.                                   [10 marks]

             Tourist destinations will generally enter a period of decline (Butler). The answer should
             describe strategies designed to deliver economic sustainability over the long-term.

             The answer should identify the need for regeneration at a named tourist destination and
             should describe the relevant strategies. The term “destination” can be accepted on any
             scale from a country to a small tourist enclave, such as a resort.

             Evaluation is essential, but may be speculative where the outcomes of regeneration are
             not yet known.

             Responses including explicit evaluation of regeneration strategies are likely to be
             credited at bands E/F.

             Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

C11. Topographic mapping

    (a)   Briefy describe three characteristics of slope XY shown on the map.                  [3 marks]

          The following characteristics would be relevant:
            Length – 1 km (not 4 cm)
            Gradient – steep, 1:4. Some quantification needed
            Shape (morphology) – convex or relevant description
            Aspect – facing north-west
            Land use – settlement, mixed vegetation on upper slope, brushwood and forest at the foot
            Change of slope at approx 250 m
            Change in elevation (quantification needed 50 m – 390 m)

          For full marks some clear reference to relevant map evidence or quantification or the use of
          precise terminology is expected.

    (b)   Using only an annotated sketch map, divide the whole area into distinct
          physical regions and briefly describe each one.                         [6 marks]

          Credit should only be given for information which is either written on the map or linked to it
          by arrows or a key. The “physical” regions must be defined by either relief, drainage,
          vegetation or a combination of these. All must be distinct, clearly outlined [2 marks], named
          and briefly described [2 marks]. Award a further [2 marks] for the overall appearance of the
          sketch map which should include an accurate scale and northpoint.
          References to settlement agriculture or transportation are not appropriate and should not be
          credited.

    (c)   Explain two advantages and two disadvantages of locating a campsite at point A.      [4 marks]

          Advantages:
          These include access to the settlements of Grande Fontaine (0.7 km south-west) and Bouillon
          (0.5 km north-east) for services and Source de Bouillon provides fresh water. The low
          altitude (< 10 m) and level topography make it suitable for setting up a sheltered camp. There
          are nearby recreational interests (ravines and coastal features). Also credit access to St Paul
          and proximity to a main route for easy access.

          Disadvantages:
          These include flood risk, saturated ground and possible insect nuisance with the abundance of
          wetlands within 1 km to the north-east. Other valid advantages and disadvantages should be
          credited.

          Maximum [3 marks] if no use of grid references or relative distance or direction.

(d)   Analyse the settlement pattern shown on the map.                                     [7 marks]

      The answer should include a description of the type and distribution of settlement and an
      analytical overview of factors influencing the pattern.

      Description of pattern:
      The principal town of St Paul is densely populated and its linear morphology follows the
      coastline and its growth is restricted on the east side by the wetlands. There are several
      overspill settlements close to St Paul such as Grande Fontaine (0311) and Savanna (0514)
      which are evidence of suburbanization related to road network development.
      Between 350 m – 550 m (altitude) small villages are linked by a road from Bullemène (0510)
      to Le Bois de Nèfles (0813) and La Plaine (0715). These settlements are located amongst the
      sugar plantations avoiding the ravines and overlooking St Paul. To the north of the map is an
      area of sparse settlement and the obsolete radio antenna site – Pline Chabrier has none.

      The analysis:
      Positive factors encouraging settlement in this area include accessibility and proximity to
      employment. Tourism and commercial activities along the coastline; areas of scenic beauty
      such as the west-facing slope overlooking St Paul on the coast. Negative factors deterring
      settlement include: steep slopes, ravines and poorly drained lowland. There may be other
      valid factors that should be credited.

      Award [4 marks] for identification of different types of settlement and an accurate description
      of their distribution. The analysis should give an overview of settlement distribution in the
      whole area of the map with reference to factors which have been influential [3 marks].
      Answers that do not refer to actual places or grid references should not be awarded more
      than [4 marks].
