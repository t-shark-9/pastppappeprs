Answer three questions. Each question is worth [10 marks].

1.    With the aid of a diagram, explain the impact on producers and consumers of a subsidy on a good.


2.    With the aid of at least one diagram, explain one way a consumer might gain from the behaviour of
      a monopolist and one way a consumer might lose from the behaviour of a monopolist.


3.    Explain how inflation can be measured and explain three problems associated with the measurement
      of inflation.


4.    With the aid of a diagram, explain how an increase in transfer payments to the poorest households in
      a nation is likely to affect the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient of that nation.


5.    Explain the difference between a fixed exchange rate and a floating (flexible) exchange rate.


6.    Explain the difference between outward-oriented growth strategies and inward-oriented
      growth strategies.
