                                               N-PHARMA

          N-Pharma is one of the biggest multinational companies (MNC) operating in the pharmaceutical
          industry.   It employs over 30 000 people globally.   The corporate headquarters are in
          Tsukuba Science City near Tokyo in Japan.


          History

          N-Pharma was founded in 1973 by Yukio Nakamura, a Japanese chemist.   It began as a
     5    small laboratory in a suburb of Tokyo employing nine members of staff.   It was set up as a
          private limited company.   In common with most other start-ups, poor cash flow meant that
          the early years were financially challenging.   Costs were high as Yukio was developing a new
          type of painkiller, Pharmax, which was launched in 1977 to widespread acclaim.  From this point,
          sales rose rapidly and high profits enabled Yukio to expand his business.   Within three years,
    10    the number of people employed by N-Pharma grew from 9 to 200 employees.  Throughout this
          period of expansion, a key feature of Yukio’s management philosophy was to maintain close
          relationships with suppliers.

          Since 1980, the business has continued to grow.  A combination of strong demand in the mid 1980s
          and a period of economic boom in Japan enabled N-Pharma to expand within the Pacific Rim.  
    15    In 1986 a subsidiary was established in Seattle, United States (USA), followed by another in
          Canberra (Australia) two years later.   N-Pharma has also opened smaller subsidiaries in
          other countries such as Canada, Mexico, Chile, Vietnam, South Korea and New Zealand.  
          Subsidiaries are responsible for both production and distribution of N-Pharma drugs in their
          national markets, as well as research and development (R&D).


          Product development

    20    In the pharmaceutical industry, R&D departments have a critical role in ensuring
          successful innovation.   New product development can lead to competitive advantage,
          business growth, higher profits and therefore shareholder satisfaction.  However, R&D is a long
          and expensive process: it could take more than 17 years from the discovery of a new drug to its
          launch onto the market (Appendix 1).   The process of approval involves significant testing to
    25    ensure the safety of the drugs.  This takes longer than in other industries, which is why all new
          drugs, once commercialized, tend to be expensive.   Once production begins, quality assurance
          and quality control are vital to ensure the continuing safety of the drugs.

           Marketing

           When N-Pharma sets the prices of its drugs, it must cover not only the costs of production and
           distribution, but also the costs of past R&D.  Pricing is usually cost-based, although some other
    30     factors may be taken into account, for example the price of competitors’ drugs.  Pharmaceutical
           companies do not normally use market-based pricing strategies of penetration or skimming.  

           N-Pharma has a portfolio of drugs at different stages of their product life cycle, for example:
           • Pharmax is still very important for the company.   It has a share of around one-third of the
             market for painkillers in Japan and the USA.  That figure has been stable for the last 10 years.  
    35       Although the market is saturated and growing very slowly, this painkiller is a well-established
             product.  Following the expiry of the original patent, competitors are now starting to produce
             cheaper substitutes.
           • A range of drugs was launched in the early 2000s.  One of them, Pharmaflo, is designed to
             prevent heart attacks; it already has a high 15 % share in a market that is still growing rapidly.  
    40       On the other hand, some other N-Pharma drugs are performing quite poorly; such as the
             Pharmaslim line of products for weight control.   The market for anti-obesity drugs is
             growing rapidly.   It is very competitive and gaining market share is proving more difficult
             than anticipated.
           • In 2009, N-Pharma launched a new anti-aging drug called Pharmatics.  Thanks to significant
    45       introductory marketing efforts, with both above the line and below the line promotion,
             the first sales results were satisfactory.  It is, however, too early to tell whether present sales
             will be maintained.

           Although launching a new drug is a complex marketing activity, N-Pharma has a key
           strength: its well-established brand name has been maintained by aggressive advertising in
    50     specialist magazines.   N-Pharma’s logo is present on all its products; its family branding has
           attracted considerable brand loyalty.   Market research shows that most adults across East Asia
           recognize N-Pharma labels and regard them as a mark of quality and safety.

           N-Pharma drugs are trusted but are expensive.  In periods of economic difficulties, many people
           prefer to buy generic drugs*, which are cheaper.  Yukio has calculated that the demand for some
    55     of N-Pharma’s products is income elastic.

          Managing human resources in a multinational company

          N-Pharma has attempted to introduce the same tall organizational structure in all its subsidiaries.  
          However, this uniform approach to hierarchical organization has not proved appropriate as it
          ignores cultural differences between some of the countries where N-Pharma operates.  

          In Canada for instance, employees have repeatedly stated that they want more delegation
    60    and a wider span of control.   The Canadian subsidiary has recently suffered lower levels of
          productivity compared to other N-Pharma subsidiaries.   In this current financial year, it has
          even traded at a loss.  Several managers have been unable to improve productivity, so Yukio has
          appointed Susan James as chief executive officer (CEO) in Canada to return the subsidiary to
          profitability in the coming financial year.  Susan has dismissed requests for greater empowerment.  
    65    Although morale has deteriorated and strike action has been threatened by the union, she
          refuses to change her leadership style.  She has the support of the rest of her management team.  
          The problems have been exacerbated by her inability to communicate and by the tall
          hierarchical structure.   With negotiations and collective bargaining now in process,
          Susan understands that employees may be left demotivated and that productivity might suffer.  
    70    She knows that Canadian employees respond well to financial motivation, so her solution to the
          problems is to redirect some of her R&D budget to her human resources (HR) department in
          order to implement performance-related pay (PRP).

          In Australia the N-Pharma CEO, Laura Davies, is facing different issues.   Unlike Canada,
          employees in Australia do not have problems with long chains of command.  Instead they want
    75    changes in employment patterns and practices in order to suit their lifestyle and to have a better
          work/life balance.   Many have questioned the appropriateness of traditional working hours;
          they have been arguing for flexitime and teleworking.  Absenteeism has become a key issue for
          Laura and has impacted on workforce planning.   N-Pharma employees in Australia are not
          motivated by financial incentives as they already have a high standard of living.  Laura Davies
    80    anticipates, therefore, that the Australian employees of N-Pharma will respond positively to
          non-financial rewards and these will improve employees’ job satisfaction, motivation and
          productivity.


          Current issues: N-Pharma in the media

          Since 1980, N-Pharma has been a public limited company with its shares traded on the
          Tokyo Stock Exchange.   Shareholders have traditionally been happy to invest in N-Pharma,
    85    regarding the shares as a relatively risk-free, safe investment.   However, many have recently
          expressed concerns about the way N-Pharma’s public image has been tarnished by some events
          and problems.

          In 2008, one of N-Pharma’s laboratories found itself at the centre of a controversy reported by the
          world’s media.  Its scientists were conducting research on the effects of a new drug and as part of
    90    the testing, they carried out experiments on animals.   Many of these animals suffered a
          painful death.   A “whistleblower”* alerted the authorities because the standard regulations
          and benchmarks that were supposed to ensure the care of animals were not followed.  
          Unannounced, veterinary inspectors visited the premises and wrote a damaging report.  
          The document was leaked to journalists and this started a “media frenzy” with headlines such
    95    as “Animals tortured at N-Pharma lab” and “N-Pharma lab of shame”.  Animal rights activists
          vandalised several laboratories as well as the Tsukuba headquarters; Yukio Nakamura himself
          received letters threatening him and his family.   The weight of public opinion worldwide
          was against N-Pharma, even though a costly public relations exercise reduced the impact to a
          certain extent.

  100     Following the negative publicity, N-Pharma tightened its procedures and created a new post
          of “director of corporate social responsibility”.   The person appointed to the position was
          Tadashi Agi, a professor of business ethics at the National University of Tsukuba.   Tadashi is
          now writing a “Charter of Ethics”, setting ethical objectives for the company.  He intends to use a
          Kaizen approach to change the corporate culture and encourage ethical practices in all
  105     departments.  He is making extensive use of information and communication technology (ICT) to
          communicate his ethical vision to internal and external stakeholders.  He also plans to carry out
          social and environmental audits.


          Accounts and finance

          Although N-Pharma has large financial reserves and could theoretically withstand any financial
          instability including an economic recession, the board of directors is aware that financial markets
  110     are volatile.

          The USA subsidiary of N-Pharma recently had a liquidity problem and as a form of crisis
          management the Tsukuba headquarters had to intervene to provide some extra short-term capital.  
          The board of directors of N-Pharma sent Suzuko Tanaka, one of the Japanese financial auditors, to
          Seattle to enquire about the problem.  Although Suzuko found that the financial information was
  115     not up-to-date she managed to collect some data (Appendix 2).

          The future: external growth and strategic options

          In October 2008, in one week alone, the value of N-Pharma shares dropped by 25 %.  Although the
          market recovered, N-Pharma remains vulnerable to takeover.

          The board of directors of N-Pharma is considering several strategic options for the future
          growth of N-Pharma.  As part of this consideration Yukio has provided the board with a range of
  120     economic data and forecasts (Appendix 3).

          Option 1: Market development in Europe

          N-Pharma does not commercialize any of its drugs in Europe yet; it has three possible routes into
          the European market:

          (a)    Through direct entry.  If N-Pharma wants to get its branded drugs known across Europe,
                 where customers have strong brand loyalty towards products they already know,
  125            this strategy would require an investment of 75 000 million yen in communication,
                 promotion and advertising.
          (b)    Through the acquisition of several small pharmaceutical companies based in Europe.  
                 The takeovers would require an investment of 100 000 million yen but would ensure
                 access to national markets as well as economies of scale.   However, if another recession
  130            hits Europe, those smaller companies could be cheaper to buy.
          (c)    Through a joint venture with R-Taylor, the European market leader in drugs distribution.  
                 N-Pharma would gain access to new customers, whilst R-Taylor would benefit from
                 successful R&D activities.  The cost of the joint venture is estimated at 75 000 million yen.  
                 Such a large scale joint venture would need prior approval from the European Union
  135            Commission.  The legislation is too strict at the moment although this might change in the
                 next couple of years.

          Option 2: Market penetration within China

          N-Pharma already sells some of its drugs in China, especially through business-to-business (B2B)
          operations with private clinics and it could take advantage of the rapid economic development
          and increasing life expectancy in China.   N-Pharma could set up a major centre in Beijing;
  140     this would cost 50 000 million yen and give access to the largest market in the world.  
          Some members of the board of directors have a number of concerns, such as:
          • the patent legislation is not enforced so strictly in China (some Chinese competitors could
             rapidly copy some of N-Pharma’s drugs and sell them at a lower price)
          • the quality control procedures are not as tight in China (N-Pharma drugs manufactured in
  145        China may not be of the same quality as the ones produced in other countries)
          • the historic disagreements between the two countries (political changes in China could have
             a negative impact on the N-Pharma subsidiary).

          Option 3: Diversification

          Some members of the board of directors believe that as part of their new ethical stance
          N-Pharma ought to widen its portfolio of products to include animal welfare.  At the moment,
  150     N-Pharma only offers drugs for humans, but the veterinary market is booming.   The market
          for animal drugs could represent the future of N-Pharma.  As there is a strong element of risk,
          a strategic approach could be a merger with Anigam, one of the world specialists in
          animal drugs.  Anigam is well established in the USA and Europe, but not in Asia.
