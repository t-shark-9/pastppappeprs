This section is worth [40 marks].

                                         PRESCRIBED WORK

Questions 1 (a) and 1 (b) refer to the work Dido and Aeneas, by H Purcell. Answer both parts, questions 1(a)
and 1(b). In your answers be as specific as possible, not only describing the musical elements
but also giving their location in the score (including bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s) and
instrument(s) involved). Accurate location will be part of the assessment. Indicate clearly the edition of
the score that you are using.

1.    Dido and Aeneas by H Purcell

      (a)   [Prelude for the Witches and Harm’s our Delight]

            Analyse in detail the musical features found in this extract which place this
            work in the baroque period.   Support your arguments with clear reference to
            the score.   These arguments may include (but are not limited to) comments
            on structure, harmony, melody, rhythm and orchestration.                      [20 marks]

      (b)   Dido and Aeneas makes use of many structural devices typical of the baroque
            period.   Choose two (or more) devices and describe and analyse how they are
            used by Purcell.  Support your answer with clear reference to the score.  In your
            answer to question 1 (b) do not refer to the extract from question 1 (a).         [20 marks]
