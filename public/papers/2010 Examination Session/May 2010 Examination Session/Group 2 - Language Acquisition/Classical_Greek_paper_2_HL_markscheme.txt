1.   (a)   Highly poetic [1 mark] with much sustained leaf imagery [1 mark]; the significance is
           about to become clear [1 mark] as Glaucus and Diomedes discover joint guest friendship
           [1 mark] which precludes their fighting one another [1 mark]; the timing, right before the
           whole incident, warns the reader that something major is to be expected soon [1 mark].
           At 145–149, Glaucos seems to be arguing that genealogy is of no consequence [1 mark],
           whereas, at 150–151, he seems to concede it that is of great interest to people [1 mark].
           Other ideas on their merits.
     
     (b)   He is clearly a person of little virtue [1 mark] as his subsequent treatment of Bellerophon
           reveals [1 mark].

     (c)   The gods awarded Bellerophon many good things [1 mark]; Zeus controlled the politics of
           Ephyre [1 mark].
                                                                                      [12 marks]


2.   (a)   Hector is talking to Andromache (accept “his wife”) [1 mark]; he is trying to comfort her but
           is unlikely to succeed since he starts by telling her he will not die [1 mark], but then admits he
           might [1 mark].

     (b)   [1 mark] for each correct line. Mark only syllables.

     (c)   Hector’s baby son had been frightened by his father’s helmet [1 mark], so he took it
           off [1 mark].

     (d)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or an answer with no more than one minor error (tense,
           number etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded
           [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark.
                                                                                           [10 marks]
                                                 –4–             M10/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Hedonistic conduct [1 mark] because people would disapprove [1 mark].

     (b)   The people were seeking swift rewards [1 mark] because they felt that they could quickly lose
           their money or their life [1 mark] to the plague [1 mark]. The third mark can be won
           implicitly.

     (c)   Glory [1 mark] which no longer could be expected to survive death [1 mark].

     (d)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or an answer with no more than one minor error (tense,
           number etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded
           [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark.
                                                                                           [10 marks]


4.   (a)   That they were boastful [1 mark];           accept “power” [1 mark].

     (b)   Homer (and other poets) had glorified war and warriors [1 mark]. The Athenians needed no
           such help [1 mark].

     (c)   [1 mark] each for up to four examples, a second mark each for explanations.
                                                                                             [12 marks]
                                                  –5–               M10/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   (a)   Jocasta has fled the stage [1 mark] either because she realizes the truth or “to hang herself”
           [1 mark].

     (b)   [1 mark] for each of two choices; a third mark for what they tell of either Oedipus’ strengths
           or his weaknesses [1 mark].

     (c)   [3 marks] for a correct answer or an answer with no more than one minor error (tense,
           number etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be awarded
           [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark.


     (d)   [1 mark] for each correct line. Mark only syllables.
                                                                                                [10 marks]


6.   (a)   The plague [1 mark]. He has sent Creon to consult the god [1 mark].

     (b)   [1 mark] each for up to four choices; [1 mark] each for up to four justifications.

     (c)   The lie was that Laius had been attacked by more than one brigand [1 mark]; Oedipus was
           alone in the attack on the victim [1 mark]; therefore Oedipus’ victim could not have been
           Laius, as it seemed.
                                                                                          [12 marks]
                                                  –6–             M10/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


7.   (a)   Dionysus is walking and carrying nothing [1 mark]. Xanthias is carrying all their luggage
           [1 mark] but is himself seated on a donkey [1 mark].

     (b)   His argument is that if Xanthias is dissatisfied he should carry the donkey [1 mark]. It is
           obviously unreasonable but probably meant as a joke [1 mark].

     (c)          but accept “of Zeus” [1 mark]. It is inappropriate because it undermines Dionysus’
           prestige as the son of Zeus [1 mark]. It is appropriate because the word means wine jar and
           Dionysus is the god of wine [1 mark].

     (d)   If he had taken up the offer of freedom for slaves who fought for Athens [1 mark] he would
           now be free and would not have to endure his master [1 mark].
                                                                                           [10 marks]


8.   (a)   He believes that Dionysus has sworn to support him [1 mark] and that Dionysus is his
           friend [1 mark].

     (b)   The fact that his own quotation goes on to repudiate an oath [1 mark] must worry
           Euripides [1 mark].

     (c)   [1 mark] for up to four of each choice; a further [1 mark] for up to each of four explanations.
                                                                                                [12 marks]
                                                  –7–              M10/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.    (a)   Escape [1 mark]. Giving in to Crito’s advice [1 mark] or not [1 mark].

      (b)   That it seems to rest on the opinion [1 mark] of one man [1 mark].       Other ideas on
            their merits.

      (c)   [3 marks] for a good answer that makes a good case for the option chosen. [2 marks] for a
            weaker version. [1 mark] for a recognition of the issue but poorly argued. Otherwise no
            mark.

      (d)   Odd order especially the very weak climax [1 mark]. Odd plurals, especially
            [1 mark].
                                                                                          [10 marks]


10.   (a)   [2 marks] for a perfect answer or [1 mark] with one minor error. [1 mark] for one major
            error or two minor errors. Otherwise no mark

      (b)   For [8 marks], candidates should choose four examples [4 marks] and four analyses
            [4 marks].

      (c)   Hardly at all [1 mark] if he wants to do something [1 mark].
                                                                                          [12 marks]
