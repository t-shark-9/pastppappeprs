The answers given in this markscheme contain the essential information that candidates are expected to
provide in order to gain full marks for each question.
Where appropriate, the information may be expressed in phrases other than those indicated, but full
marks may only be awarded if all the necessary information is given.
Incomplete answers should be marked as directed.
Do not use half marks.
Unless otherwise indicated no marks are to be awarded or deducted for use of language: linguistic errors
should only be taken into account if communication is severely impaired and the answer is
incomprehensible to a normal speaker of the language.
Assistant Examiners are requested to wait until they are contacted by their team leader before
beginning the marking (see the examiners instructions for further details).




Les réponses données dans ce barème de notation contiennent l’essentiel de ce qu’on demande aux
candidats pour qu’ils puissent obtenir la note maximum pour chaque question.
Les réponses peuvent être formulées différemment mais la note maximum ne sera attribuée que si le
contenu de la réponse est exact.
Les réponses incomplètes seront notées selon les indications données.
En aucun cas, des demi-points ou des fractions ne doivent être attribués.
À moins d’une indication spécifique, aucun point ne sera ni ajouté ni ôté pour l’utilisation de la langue :
les erreurs linguistiques ne seront prises en considération que si elles nuisent sérieusement à la
communication et rendent ainsi la réponse incompréhensible.
Les examinateurs assistants sont priés d’attendre d’être contactés par leur chef d’équipe avant de
commencer leurs corrections (voir les instructions aux examinateurs pour de plus amples détails).




Las siguientes respuestas contienen la información esencial que los alumnos han de proporcionar para
conseguir la máxima puntuación en cada pregunta.
En ocasiones, esta información puede expresarse de manera distinta a la indicada, pero para conseguir
la máxima puntuación se han de mencionar todos los detalles requeridos.
Las respuestas incompletas deberán corregirse de la manera indicada en las instrucciones.
No utilice fracciones de puntos.
A menos que se indique lo contrario, no se deben añadir ni restar puntos por la calidad en el uso de la
lengua: los errores lingüísticos sólo se tomarán en cuenta si la comunicación queda seriamente
perjudicada o si la respuesta resulta incomprensible.
Se pide a los examinadores asistentes que esperen a ser contactados por su examinador líder de equipo
antes de iniciar la corrección (para más información, refiéranse a las instrucciones para los
examinadores).

TEXT D — THE FACEBOOK REVOLUTION

Communicative Purpose:
Description/Factual – communicate to students through a set of guidelines.

Cultural Interaction:
The aim is to write a set of guidelines for the student body to educate them on the appropriate and
responsible use of Facebook.

Register and Style:
The register should be in the range of semi-formal to informal.
Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
obscure meaning.
A brief introduction and conclusion should be included.
Bullet points are not mandatory but, if used, should be rewarded under Criterion A.

Message:
The guidelines should focus on the negative aspects of Facebook with an appropriate cautionary
tone.

The descriptors regarding copying from the text should be strictly adhered to. Verbatim copying of
details from the text is acceptable provided that the details are “used”, that is, sensibly incorporated
into the response. Copying details without so using them constitutes “undue copying”.

Irrelevant details which are selected should be considered under Criterion B and penalized
appropriately. Similarly, details not found in the text should not be included.

The candidate should include some of the following details from the text:

A. Remember there is a downside to sharing too much information on Facebook. / Remember
   nothing posted on the Internet is private.
B. Don’t include any information that could lead to the punishment of you or other students.
C. Don’t include any information that employers might not approve of.
D. Protect your privacy. / Change your privacy settings.
E. Keep the private information you post to a minimum.
F. Never post your address, birthday, telephone number, class schedule or anything else that you
   would not want a stranger to know. / Never include personal details you do not want a stranger
   to know.
G. Don’t post inappropriate pictures as they can be printed out and saved – for years even.
H. Don’t show off bad behaviour – especially illegal behaviour.

HL Paper 1, Section B: Written Response
Criterion A: Cultural Interaction
To what extent does the candidate select language appropriate to the audience and type of text?
    How appropriate and clear is the use of register and style to both the type of text required and the
     audience?
          (Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
          obscure meaning.)

Achievement
Level

0          Level 1 is not achieved.

1–2           The response is barely adequate.
                The use of register and style is rarely appropriate to both the type of text required and the
                audience; language mistakes generally obscure meaning.

3–4           The response is generally adequate but not always convincing.
                The use of register and style is sometimes appropriate to either the type of text required or
                the audience; language mistakes often obscure meaning.

5–6           The response is competent and mostly convincing.
                The use of register and style is generally appropriate to both the type of text required and the
                audience; language mistakes obscure meaning at times.

7–8           The response is convincing.
                The use of register and style is appropriate to both the type of text required and the audience;
                language mistakes rarely obscure meaning.

9–10          The response is convincing and shows some imagination.
                The use of register and style is highly appropriate to both the type of text required and the
                audience; language mistakes do not obscure meaning.
                                                     –9–           M10/2/ABENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+



Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate include all necessary information from the source text in the message?
    Does the candidate seem to have understood the source text thoroughly and perceptively?
    Has the candidate provided all the details from the source text that are relevant to the task?
    How appropriately have the details from the source text been used in the written response, without
     undue copying of the source text?

Achievement
Level

0             Level 1 is not achieved.

1–2           The understanding of the source text seems fairly limited.
                The details selected from the text are generally insufficient and/or irrelevant.
                Many parts of the source text have been copied because of limited understanding.

3–4           The understanding of the source text seems adequate.
                The details selected from the text may be partly insufficient and/or sometimes irrelevant.
                Some parts of the source text have been copied because of some difficulties with
                understanding.

5–6           The understanding of the source text seems competent.
                Sufficient relevant details have been selected from the text.
                The selected details are used appropriately to some extent, without undue copying of the
                source text.

7–8           The understanding of the source text seems very good.
                Many relevant details have been selected from the text.
                The selected details are mostly used appropriately without undue copying of the source text.

9–10          The understanding of the source text seems thorough and perceptive.
                Almost all relevant details have been selected from the text.
                The selected details are all used appropriately without undue copying of the source text.
