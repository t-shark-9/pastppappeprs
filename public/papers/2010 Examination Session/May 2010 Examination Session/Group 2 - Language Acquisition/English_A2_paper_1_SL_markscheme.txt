Standard Level, paper 1

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                           SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from a promotional website and a
newspaper article.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  note that both texts are about the death of pets and, more specifically, about the ways that pet
  owners memorialize their deceased pets
  call attention to the different genres, one a promotional website and the other a
  newspaper article
  call attention to one or two stylistic devices in each text: for example, repetition, the use of
  second person, and the use of adjectives in text 1; technical language, quotation and numbers in
  text 2.


A better comparative commentary may:

  discuss key stylistic devices in more detail, perhaps comparing the use of very emotive language
  in text 1 with the emphasis on numbers, facts and procedures in text 2
  be more specific about the shared subject, noting differences in the way that the authors respond
  to people’s desire to memorialize their pets
  discuss the promotional elements of text 1, recognizing that it is designed to appeal to grieving
  pet owners
  comment on the tone of each text, noting that the tone of text 1 is persistently emotive and
  sympathetic (―we understand‖ and ―we feel a profound sense of grief‖), while text 2 is somewhat
  arch or derisive (―freeze-dried Pekinese‖)
  note that the serenity and graciousness evoked in text 1 (―warm, inviting setting‖) is in contrast
  to the ―crude technology‖ detailed in text 2
  consider what the headings reveal about the texts, noting that the sub-heading in text 1 dignifies
  the idea of the pet as a ―best friend‖ whereas the heading in text 2 is less emotive and less serious
  (perhaps even comic).
                                               –4–            M10/2/A2ENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The best comparative commentaries may:

  discuss the effects of various stylistic devices, for example, repetition, the use of second person,
  and the use of adjectives in text 1; technical language, quotation and numbers in text 2
  consider that the pet owner quoted in text 2 echoes some of the language used by the authors of
  text 1; e.g. ―how hard it is to say goodbye‖ (text 1) and ―I couldn’t let him go‖ (text 2),
  ―perpetuate‖ (text 1) and ―preserve him‖ (text 2)
  contrast the cool, often clinical, and often derisive tone of text 2 with the persistently
  sympathetic tone in text 1
  contrast the evocation of restfulness and serenity in text 1 with the—arguably—violent or
  ―crude‖ process in text 2 (―gutted‖, ―dipped,‖ ―shot,‖ and ―posed‖)
  note that text 1 emphasizes ―tastefulness‖ while text 2 suggests that there is something tasteless
  about freeze-drying a pet (―pink tongue sticking out‖)
  note that text 2 emphasizes cost; although text 1 does not mention cost, it appears to be
  addressed to people willing to spend significant sums to ensure that their pet will be
  memorialized in an exclusive setting.
                                                 –5–            M10/2/A2ENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               SECTION B

This question invites candidates to compare an extract from a magazine article and a poem.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  note that both texts are about pelicans
  call attention to the different genres, one a magazine article and the other a poem
  call attention to one or two stylistic features of each text: for example, the use of simile, allusion,
  quotation, and rhetorical question in text 3; the use of first person plural, rhyme, repetition,
  rhythm, and neologisms/nonsense words in text 4.


A better comparative commentary may:

  be more specific about the shared theme, noting that only text 4 is presented from the pelicans’
  perspective
  discuss the stylistic features in more detail
  discuss generic differences in more detail
  note that both texts celebrate pelicans, recognizing that they evoke joy in text 3 and are joyous in
  text 4
  note that both authors represent pelicans as funny-looking and ungainly: in text 3 the pelican has
  ―clown feet and a beak like a shovel‖; in text 4 the pelicans ―snort‖ and are seen ―stamping
  [their] feet with a flumpy sound‖
  note the comic elements of both texts.


The best comparative commentaries may:

  consider how a comic effect is established in each text, e.g. the use of simile in text 3 and the use
  of nonsense words and phrases in text 4
  discuss the use and the effect of the first-person plural in each text
  consider what the title reveals about the subject matter of each text, noting the
  double-meaning of ―Chorus‖ in text 4 (―Chorus‖ describes both the pelicans and the refrain
  within their poem/song)
  consider the relationship between rhyme and rhythm or cadence in text 4
  note that both texts celebrate the pelicans’ surprising grace in a variety of ways,
  including references to dance (―aerial ballet‖ in text 3 and ―wing to wing we dance around‖ in
  text 4)
  note that the rhetorical question at the end of text 3 attempts to establish a connection
  (―empathy‖) between reader and subject.
