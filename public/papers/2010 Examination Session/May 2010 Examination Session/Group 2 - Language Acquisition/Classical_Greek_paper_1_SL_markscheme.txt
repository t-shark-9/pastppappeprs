Each word is assigned 0 or 1 or 2 points. Those worth 1 or 2 points indicate this value immediately
following the word, while those with zero points have no numerical indication.

A 1-point word (for example, an adverb or conjunction) needs only a correct translation to get the point.
For a 2-point word, if the translation persuades you that the candidate understands the meaning of
the word, one point is awarded; if the candidate persuades you that the grammar of the word
is understood, then the second point is awarded.

When two words are joined by “_” they are to be treated as one word. A two word phrase worth two
points includes one point for vocabulary and one point for grammar. The vocabulary point is awarded
only if both words are translated correctly in context; a vocabulary error in either or both words results in
no points for vocabulary. The grammar point is awarded if the phrase’s grammar is understood correctly.

In this particular case, there are 70 possible points.
