These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

1.    As a member of your school’s Journalism Club, you have been asked to write an article about
      an issue or problem affecting students. Write an article for your fellow students describing
      the issue or problem and offering advice on how to deal with it.

      Explanation/Factual – semi-formal to formal – article for fellow students

      A good answer
       will clearly present and describe the issue or problem affecting students
       will offer advice on how to deal with it
       will adopt a semi-formal to formal register.


2.    Your school recently received a large sum of money to fund innovative student travel
      opportunities. Write a letter to the head of the grant committee about an idea you have for
      such a trip and why you think it will be beneficial for students.

      Written interaction – formal – letter

      A good answer
       will request funds for an innovative student travel opportunity/trip
       will clearly explain the innovative travel opportunity/trip
       will provide a rationale for the trip and detail how it will be beneficial for the writer/other
         students
       will adopt a formal register
       will include letter formatting (date, opening, closing, etc.).
                                               –4–             M10/2/ABENG/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   You are participating in a debate on the motion: “Education is more successful when students
     have a friendly relationship with their teachers”. Write the text of your speech, either
     agreeing or disagreeing with this motion.

     Argument/Controversial – semi-formal to formal – text of a speech

     A good answer
      will clearly support one side of the argument
      will provide reasons either for or against the motion
      will clearly explain the writer’s position through examples
      will adopt a fairly formal register which may, however, be enlivened by flashes of
        informality (this should be rewarded)
      may include reference to the opposing viewpoint in order to rebut (this should be
        rewarded)
      will use appropriate conventions such as opening and closing salutations as well as
        occasional direct address.


4.   At school you recently witnessed an incident of academic dishonesty such as cheating or
     plagiarism. You have decided to report this incident to the principal. Write a detailed
     statement about the incident to help in the investigation.

     Factual narration – formal – statement to the principal

     A good answer
      will clearly recount the events which occurred
      will use appropriate markers to highlight the time and place of the events which occurred
      will adopt a formal tone and register
      may include appropriate formatting in the form of bullet points, headings, etc. (this should
        be rewarded)
      will not devote too much content to moral outrage about cheating.
