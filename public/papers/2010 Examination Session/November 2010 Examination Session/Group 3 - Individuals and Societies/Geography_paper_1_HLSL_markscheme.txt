                       Core Theme: Population, Resources and Development

1.   (a)   Describe the distribution of refugees from the former Yugoslavia since 1991.     [3 marks]

           The description should refer to Germany [1 mark], include quantification [1 mark], and make
           one other valid statement about distribution, e.g. fewer on periphery, north-west Europe
           predominates, or any other statement that is supported by map evidence [1 mark].

     (b)   Briefly explain three factors that affect the potential mobility of voluntary
           migrants.                                                                     [6 marks]

           Answers could explain:
            Age
            Gender
            Educational levels
            National and international policies on, and obstacles to, migration
            Economic factors
            Social and cultural factors
            Accessibility/transport infrastructure.

           Other factors may be equally valid. Factors identified, but not developed or explained,
           receive no credit.

           Award up to [2 marks] for each relevant factor that includes an explanation.

     (c)   Identify and explain the positive impacts of immigration.                        [6 marks]

           Possible impacts are:
            Increase in economically active population
            Perform unskilled and low-paid work
            Fill gaps in the skilled jobs market e.g. nurses and doctors from abroad
            Increase tax revenues and boost local economies through spending
            Increase the birth rates for countries with an ageing population
            Reduce unemployment levels in country of origin
            Remittances sent home by migrants
            Increase the variety of cultures in the hosting country.

           At least three well-developed impacts should be given. Award up to [2 marks] for each
           relevant impact.
                                            –4–               N10/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Using examples, examine the problems that result from high dependency
      ratios.                                                                           [10 marks]

      The strongest answers are likely to start with a definition of dependency ratios and the age
      ranges concerned, and show an awareness of both young and old dependants. The problems
      associated with old dependants include high demand on health services and healthcare costs
      due to a large elderly population, and public/private pension schemes not being able to
      support the elderly population. The problems associated with young dependants include the
      strain on educational facilities in countries with a high birth rate. In both cases a small
      working population is left not being able to support the dependent population, and limited tax
      revenues are generated allowing only limited investment in infrastructure and services.

      Other problems cited may be relevant to the question. Examples are a specific requirement of
      the question, hence they would be expected in those answers achieving band D and above.

      Examining both youthful and ageing dependency ratios in detail is necessary for answers to
      access band F, but their treatment need not be balanced.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

2.   (a)   Define infant mortality rate.                                                        [2 marks]

           The annual number of deaths of infants below either age 1 or age 5 (definitions vary)
           [1 mark] per 1000 live births [1 mark].

     (b)   State which country is closest to reaching the target for infant mortality rate.      [1 mark]

           Country B [1 mark].

     (c)   Identify which of the three countries is most developed and justify your
           choice.                                                                  [4 marks]

           Country B is more developed [1 mark] because it is closer to meeting most of the five targets
           [1 mark]. Some quantification must be given for [1 mark] and award a final [1 mark] for any
           further valid observation, such as the anomaly that country B lags behind country C in
           primary education enrolment.

     (d)   Using located examples, explain how a lack of basic needs (food, shelter,
           and safe water) creates problems for some people.                         [8 marks]

           Lack of food suppresses the immune system, exposes people to disease, and threatens
           earnings and education through debilitation. Inadequate shelter leads to insanitary conditions,
           overcrowding (spread of disease), exposure to hazards, insecurity, and psychological
           problems. A lack of safe water leads to problems such as disease, poisoning (from pesticides)
           and loss of food resources. In all three cases a lack of basic needs may lead to inequalities or
           shortages resulting in conflict and possible starvation.

           Award up to [2 marks] for three developed problems plus up to [2 marks] for the use of
           examples. For full marks, responses must refer to all three basic needs, although the
           treatment need not be balanced.

     (e)   With reference to a country you have studied, examine how trade, aid and
           indebtedness have affected its economic development.                     [10 marks]

           This is an open-ended response but the focus of this answer should be on the external factors
           impacting upon development. The focus could be on how trade, aid and indebtedness have
           been an obstacle to economic development. However, an equally valid response could look at
           how some of these three factors also helped to increase development. This will be determined
           by the country chosen. To access band F the answer must look at all three issues, however
           they need not all be looked at in the same depth. Responses that give a detailed examination
           of a country are likely to be credited at bands E/F.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                   –6–              N10/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Describe the differences between the two trade flows shown.                            [3 marks]

           The major differences are that the flow including the co-operative is shorter or has fewer steps
           [1 mark] and that the break-down of the final price is completely different [1 mark], with the
           final [1 mark] reserved for some quantification or other clear reference to the map.

     (b)   Explain two main features of the global pattern of food trade.                      [3+3 marks]

           The main features include: the movement of food commodities, often unprocessed, from
           south to north; the provision of food aid, predominantly from developed world countries in
           the north to less developed countries in the south; the movement of tropical food crops
           towards non-tropical areas; the major exports of wheat from Australia, the USA and Canada,
           and rice from East Asia.

           The features explained need not be spatial, but could be trends or characteristics of the types
           or value of the goods involved in global food trade. Features of the trade pattern which are
           limited or small-scale should not receive more than [2 marks] each.

     (c)   Discuss how changes in technology have affected the production of one
           resource other than food.                                             [6 marks]

           Candidates may discuss any non-food resource, the most likely choices being soil, water,
           a fossil fuel or a forest product. The discussion should focus on a single resource; responses
           discussing more than one resource will be self-limiting. The changes in technology must be
           identified, and briefly described, in order for their effects on the production of the resource to
           be adequately discussed. As a general guideline, [2 marks] should be awarded for the
           description of the resource’s production, [2 marks] for the description of changes in
           technology, and [2 marks] for the effects of these changes on the resource’s production,
           though this balance may be altered at the discretion of the examiner in cases where responses
           adopt an alternative framework to discuss the changes.
                                             –7–              N10/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   “Malthusian views of the relationship between population and food remain
      relevant today.” Discuss this statement.                                 [10 marks]

      Malthus argued that population (rising at a geometric rate) would eventually outstrip food
      production (increasing at an arithmetic rate). Population would then be subject to a number of
      alternative internal or external checks, and would only be able to rise again if additional food
      supplies were to become available.

      The strongest responses will recognize that after a prolonged period (from the Green
      Revolution onwards) in which food availability increased globally, recent changes in
      production, including changes in the world prices of several staple foods, have greatly
      reduced the availability of food to some sectors of the population of some countries.

      Candidates who present a balanced view of Malthus’s relevance today, or who show a good
      understanding of contemporary population and/or food supply issues (food crisis or
      technological solutions), are likely to access bands E/F.

      It is probable that most responses will agree with the statement, but if they choose to
      challenge it, then full credit should still be available.

      Discussion of Malthusian views relating to resources other than food is not relevant to this
      question and should not be credited.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
