1.   (a)   What does Source A suggest about Lloyd George’s attitude towards
           French security?                                                 [3 marks]

            Britain and the US should give a guarantee to France against German aggression;
            This is needed because France has been attacked and invaded twice by Germany in
             half a century;
            Western democracies should protect France against German invasion until the
             League of Nations has proved its capacity to preserve peace.
            France should be protected as she had protected democracy.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].



2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about French
     security.                                                                           [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Source C supports Source D in recognizing that France does not have any external support
       for its security;
      Both sources make reference to German aggression;
      Both sources discuss the failure of attempts at international guarantees of French security.
      Both sources indicate the USA would not protect France for various reasons.
      Both sources mention that France had made concessions/sacrifices and therefore expected
       support.

     For “contrast”
      Source D explicitly blames the US for the failure of the Anglo–American Guarantee;
      Source D makes reference to British fears of French aggression;
      Source D also makes reference to British government policy towards maintaining peace in
       Eastern Europe;
      Despite Source D’s appeal for outside support, Source C makes it clear that Britain is not
       willing to make such a commitment.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are
     discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum
     [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source E for historians studying the Anglo–American
     Guarantee.                                                                            [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:      It is an extract from a memorandum written by the British Prime Minister
                  Lloyd George at Fontainebleau in March 1919.

     Purpose:     To make a statement intended for a global audience to indicate the intention to
                  give support to France by Britain and the US until the League of Nations has
                  been formed and been shown to be effective in preserving peace.

     Value:       It gives a clear statement of the intended policy of the British government and
                  is a direct indictment of German aggression against France. It also indicates
                  the future direction Britain will take and British intent to support the
                  League of Nations. It is made in 1919 while negotiations in Paris are taking
                  place over the Treaty of Versailles and gives an indication of British views
                  towards Germany.

     Limitations: As it is a public statement it is probable that Britain is making a strong statement
                  to Germany about future actions. The memorandum is clear in its attitude to
                  France but, in reality, the policies stated within it are never carried out as the
                  Anglo–French alliance and the Anglo–American Guarantee both fail.

     Source E
     Origin:      It is an extract from a book – The League of Nations – published in 1986 by an
                  academic from the London School of Economics.

     Purpose:     To analyse the foundation and role of the League of Nations in world affairs and
                  to inform and educate its readers.

     Value:       It is an in-depth study of the League of Nations by an expert in international
                  relations. It was published in 1986 and will therefore have the benefit of
                  hindsight.

     Limitations: It is not contemporary having no direct experience of the events and therefore
                  relies on the opinions of others. The focus is specifically on the League of
                  Nations and not on the Anglo–American Guarantee, which may only be a
                  peripheral part of the book.

     Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance
     between the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a
     [4/2 mark] split. If only one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum
     [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.



                                                                                          [8 marks]

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the consequences of
     the failure of the Anglo–American Guarantee on international relations
     between 1920 and 1926.

     Source material
     Source A: This source indicates that the League of Nations will be the means by which peace
               will be preserved in the future.

     Source B: This source shows the attempt at forming an alliance between France and
               Britain as the collapse of the Anglo–American Guarantee left France without
               adequate defence. It also shows the intention of the French to use military means
               to safeguard their borders.

     Source C: This source indicates that the US is not willing to be involved in European affairs.
               It also indicates that France has concerns about its security and German
               aggression and is trying to gain British support. It shows that France is not
               interested in international conferences. It also shows that Britain has no intention
               of making an alliance with France.

     Source D: This source supports the idea of French betrayal, the failure of the Anglo–French
               alliance and indicates that Britain had no intention of becoming involved in
               European affairs in Eastern Europe.

     Source E: This source shows the concern of France for its own security due to the
               non-ratification of the Anglo–American Guarantee. Similarly the failure of the
               US to join the League of Nations was a blow to world peace and, that following
               the failure of the Anglo–French alliance at Cannes in 1922, France was unwilling
               to disarm.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge may include: the desire for security in the Rhineland and the effect of the
     Treaty of Versailles’ territorial terms; the US began to look to the Pacific and hosted the
     Washington disarmament conference in 1921; France occupied the Ruhr in 1923 due to
     non-payment of reparations which led to their renegotiation through the 1924 Dawes Plan;
     the Locarno Conference of 1925 resulted in Germany being accepted into the League of
     Nations and European nations guaranteeing the security of the Rhineland.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material
     or only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks].
     For maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge,
     as well as references to the sources used.
