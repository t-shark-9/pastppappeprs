                                             SECTION A

                                    Area of impact: Business and employment

1.   (a)   Identify two characteristics of a P2P network.                                      [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • no server or client computers
           • each computer is a node
           • network used primarily for sharing files between the users.

     (b)   Users of illegal P2P file sharing networks run the risk of downloading viruses.
           Describe one indication that a computer has a virus and one preventative measure that a
           user can take to avoid viruses on their computer.                            [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           Signs of a virus
           • unusual actions on the computer screen or computer (e.g. message or image
              is displayed on the computer screen, unusual sound or music plays randomly)
           • available memory is less than what should be available
           • program or file is suddenly missing
           • file problems (e.g. file size changes without explanation, file is corrupted)
           • operating system runs much slower than usual
           • warning appears from an anti-virus program.

           Preventative measures

                                          –4–               N10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain two kinds of evidence that could have been presented in court to prove that
      copyrighted songs were offered by the woman using a P2P file sharing account. [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • Internet service provider (ISP) provides the data log of the files transferred from the
        woman’s computer using her TCP/IP number
      • the police could have found evidence on the computer hard disk used by the woman
        indicating her P2P username and illegal music downloads
      • evidence could have been presented from someone who downloaded music from the P2P
        user “tereastarr”
      • evidence on the woman’s computer hard disc of illegal music in a public folder which has
        been made available for sharing by other users.

      Award [1 mark] for each kind of evidence that could have been presented in court to prove
      that copyrighted songs were offered by the woman using a P2P user account up to a
      maximum of [2 marks]. Award an additional [1 mark] for the development of each kind of
      evidence up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Mark the first two correct kinds of evidence
      identified.

(d)   A range of online solutions have been developed to provide customers with
      legal access to music files.

      To what extent have online solutions been made available to meet customers’
      needs? Use specific examples in your response.                              [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • range of services are offered by web sites (e.g. collection of MP3 music, search
        functions, download/setup, help/support)
      • online purchase - effective means for purchasing/downloading individual music
        titles from an online service (e.g. iTunes, Spotify)
      • subscription-based model (e.g. Napster /Spotify a subscription charged and
        artists are paid each time their song is played)
      • free download - download music made available by the artist for free (e.g. MySpace)
      • easy access to purchase songs eg You Tube, in collaboration with Apple
        iTunes, is now including a link under its music videos to direct users to
        purchase the song from iTunes
      • the iPhone app, Shazam tags a sound track that is playing, identifies the track
        and provides information for purchase via iTunes.

      The specific examples may be analysed in the following manner:

      Some customers feel that online solutions are not meeting their needs because
      • some solutions are only available in certain countries
      • some downloads are only available for approved players
      • customers may be reluctant to give personal details
      • many young people do not have access to credit cards which are required for
        payment
      • costs of online purchase.

      However others are moving towards legal downloads because:
      • these sites have GUI which are easy to use
      • most music is available
      • even though there is a fee, music is still cheaper than purchasing in a shop
      • there is no need to worry about viruses – viruses may be associated with some
        P2P file sharing
      • reviews are often available
      • it may be possible to try out songs before buying
      • secure payment is possible
      • songs are high quality
      • it may be possible to purchase a single song as well as an album.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected that there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to the
      social and ethical impacts.

           developing Project X animated books.                                      [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • software compatibility with most computer systems – to provide compatibility
             with the operating system and hardware computer systems commonly used in
             schools (i.e. RAM requirements to run animations/multimedia, screen resolution
             to display images), do not accept storage or the need to install applications
           • new technologies – to address emerging software trends and technologies
           • loading time – to address how long it will take for multimedia to load
           • ease of use – to ensure the programs are easy for children to use
           • ease of setup – easy for schools to install or set up
           • content – appeals to the interest of the students.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each software consideration when developing
           Project X animated books up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award an additional
           [1 mark] for the relevant description up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Accept only

(c)   Interactive multimedia productions are often stored as compressed files
      to reduce storage space.      Explain two disadvantages of using data
      compression for this purpose.                                           [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • reduced quality of images / lower resolution
      • extra costs to encode and decode data
      • the amount of time it takes to encode/decode may interrupt real-time process
      • lossy compression – gives smaller file size, but the end product may be inferior
        to the original in some ways.

      Award [1 mark] for each disadvantage of using data compression for the purpose
      of reducing storage space up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award an additional
      [1 mark] for the development of each disadvantage up to a maximum of
      [2 marks]. Mark the first two correct disadvantages identified.

(d)   The head of a primary school has decided to invest in Project X technology
      rather than in sets of printed reading books. Evaluate this decision.      [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Arguments in favour of Project X CD-ROMs
      • CD-ROMs engage the students – capture their attention with audio
        and video
      • students can hear stories read aloud – not just see text
      • can support children’s writing – encouraging them to write as well as read
      • CD-ROMs are interactive, fun and entertaining
      • encourages computer literacy amongst the children – some children may not
        have access to a computer at home, develops new IT skills
      • requires teachers to become more computer literate (i.e. using CD-ROMS,
        Smartboards, laptops).

      Arguments in favour of sets of printed reading books
      • school does not need to invest in computers
      • schools already have the ergonomic conditions for reading books. Schools
        possibly face additional cost to comply with ergonomic considerations when
        using laptops (i.e. desks, chairs, lighting)
      • technical assistance is not required – as needed by computer programs
      • close supervision during use is not required when using books as is required
        with laptops and CD-ROMs e.g. avoid damage to the CD-ROMs or laptops
      • books are portable – can be used anywhere without the need of a computer
      • equality of access – not all students have a computer to access the CD-ROMs
        at home
      • children who use Project X CD-ROMs in school may be less inclined to read
        books
      • costs may be involved in training teachers (i.e. use of Smartboards, using the
        features of the Project X CD-ROMs
      • books are more durable and accessible (i.e. CD-ROMs can get scratched, CD-
        ROMS require a laptop and be mounted for use)
      • some students may prefer books over using laptops (i.e. can take books home,
        books are always accessible).

             codes.

           Award [1 mark] for each characteristic up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe the steps by which Google Flu Trends could associate flu-related
           keywords entered by users within the United States to the occurrence of flu
           in the various regions.                                                     [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • individuals search for flu-related words
           • the location of the user is identified by the TCP/IP number of their computer
           • an algorithm is used to identify the search words associated with flu-related
             keywords
           • the number of search queries are counted and recorded for each region in a
             database
           • graphs are created from the data collected from each region
           • estimates are generated from this data about how much flu is circulating in
             various regions of the United States
           • the results from the data collected by Google Flu Trends from each of the
             regions is compared to the data collected by health agencies.

           [1 mark]
           A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

           [2–3 marks]
           A reasonable description that describes some of the steps, although the answer
           may lack appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

           [4 marks]
           Clear, detailed and balanced steps by which Google Flu Trends associates
           flu-related words.

(c)   Explain why an Internet search engine would get different results when
      skin cancer (without quotation marks) is entered and when “skin cancer”
      (with quotation marks) is entered.                                                   [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • quotation marks narrow search – uses exact phrasing
      • no quotation marks – result may contain results with either word or both words
      • skin cancer returns results with skin or cancer or both, whereas “skin cancer”
        returns only results where the words “skin cancer” appear together like
        one word
      • Boolean search operators – AND, OR and NOT assist in narrowing searches.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]

(d)   To what extent should analysis tools such as Google Flu Trends be used as the
      main providers of information for governments and health organizations in
      planning resources to manage illnesses?                                       [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • it can provide updated information regularly
      • the data can be broken down by geographical location
      • it can be used to compare larger populations
      • provides quicker access to data – instant access allows for quicker analysis
      • algorithms could be used to detect anomalies and conspirators who try
        to manipulate data
      • provides healthcare workers with an early-warning system for flu outbreaks
      • data collected may not be accurate (i.e. some people who are ill do not use the
        internet, botnet could be used to spoof data)
      • need to ensure aggregate search data about flu outbreaks cannot be used
        to identify the people who provided the information
      • analysis possible using large data sets
      • Google Flu Trends may provide data different from doctors because many
        people who have the flu may not go to the doctor, but search in Google for
        information about their illness
      • Google Flu Trends only provides an analysis from using Google searches and
        does not take into account persons who use other search engines.

(d)   In recent years, advances in 3D technology and significant increases in the
      processing capability of computers have seen greater numbers of people
      adopting these technologies.

      To what extent do you agree with the statement that “the development of
      interactive online learning environments will never satisfactorily replace
      face-to-face contact”?                                                     [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Interactive online learning
      • distance education – will enable students to learn from various remote places
      • flexibility – can learn anytime, anywhere
      • more choice – students will have more courses to choose from
      • can be recorded and replayed
      • online courses are time consuming to create for teachers
      • quality of audio/video may not be adequate
      • technical requirements are greater – students need Internet, computer and
         web cam
      • scheduling might be difficult with different time zones.
      • some students have difficulty using interactive online learning environments.

      Face-to-face
      • class sizes are smaller – easier to know others on the course
      • direct interaction – meeting people face-to-face / socialization / learning activities
        involving face-to-face interaction
      • teacher directly responsible for class instruction
      • have to travel to a specific location
      • limited to people from a geographical area
      • not subject to the technical difficulties that may be involved in interactive online learning
        environments.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected that there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      the social and ethical impacts.

5.   (a)   Identify two input devices that are required in order for Jules to interact with a real
           person.                                                                       [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • microphone
           • digital video camera or web cam
           • camera.

           Award [1 mark] for each input device up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe the steps that Jules would take in order to follow the movement
           of the person talking to him.                                    [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • capture the initial image of the person with the web cam/robot (sensors) captures image
           • use facial recognition software to determine the parts of the face to be tracked
             (reference points) / identify parts of the face (eg eyes for eye contact)
           • record an initial position (i.e. t0), of the face to be tracked/set the position of the human in
             relation to robot’s own position
           • record time lapse intervals
           • capture another image at a second position (i.e. t1)
           • determine the location of the reference points
           • compare new position of reference points (t1), with the initial position (t0)
           • if position is the same as before, then no movement is detected and there is no adjustment
           • if position changes, movement is detected and robot adjusts to the movement
           • changing voice frequency may assist in determining the person’s position
           • calculate the rotation to move Jules’ head
           • actuators/mechanical devices rotate robot’s head the required distance
           • loop/repeat the process.

(d)   Jules may have difficulty understanding a sentence in a conversation with
      a human. Explain why this could happen.                                   [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • vocabulary used in the sentence is unknown to the robot (reason: word is not in its internal
        language database)
      • unusual grammar or sentence structure (reason: may be limited by Jules’ ability to eg
        analyse context)
      • accent or dialect making the words sound different (reason: robot has not been trained to
        recognise that person’s voice)
      • idiomatic expression was used
      • Unclear/inaudible speech (reason: captured voice unclear then converted to digital sound
        files which can’t be matched)
      • Background noise/interference may mask human voice input
      • linguistic differences - words may have different meaning depending of the context.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the reason is not
      clear.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of the difficulties that Jules has in understanding
      a sentence in a conversation with a human. The answer may be unbalanced and lack
      appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of why Jules may have difficulty understanding a
      sentence in a conversation with a human.

(d)   The organizers of an important tennis tournament are considering using a robot similar
      to Jules, named Tennis-Umpire, for the purpose of umpiring some of the games. This
      robot, which remains seated throughout the match, uses its own cameras to analyse the
      game and then communicates its decisions to the human spectators using speech.

      Evaluate whether the organizers should go ahead with this decision to replace human
      umpires with robotic umpires such as Tennis-Umpire.                        [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive
      • robot would consistently determine the outcome of each play – eliminates variation in
        human reaction
      • robot is not affected by physical conditions (e.g. tiredness, weather, crowd reaction)
      • robot is not biased – a human umpire may have a preference towards a particular player
        winning, or according to recent studies, tennis umpires are more likely to make mistakes
        when they call balls “out” than when they call them “in”, these errors are a result of the
        way the human brain processes visual information about motion.

              [Source: adapted from http://physorg.com/news144328896.html, 4 July 2009]

      Negative
      • robot may not be able to follow the movement of the ball quickly enough, causing a delay
        in processing the call
      • robots involve mechanical moving parts, there is a possibility of a problem in the physical
        functioning of the robot (necessitating replacement with another robot or human umpire).
      • in a tennis game there are several other officials – one robot cannot call all of the plays
        (players may block the view, other umpires will be required with the ability to
        communicate with the Tennis-Umpire)
      • robots can judge technical details of tennis (e.g. location of the tennis ball, applying the
        rules), but cannot judge human aspects of the game (e.g. inappropriate behaviour by
        players)
      • job loss for current umpires
      • cost of Tennis-Umpire including hardware, software, updates, maintenance, repairs – this
        will be offset by saving on salaries
      • public (players/supporter) reaction to Tennis-Umpire may be negative – how do players
        dispute a decision?
      • a robot is not programmed to anticipate the unexpected – eg if a supporter interrupts play
        by running onto the court a human umpire could request a replay.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected that there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to the social and
      ethical impacts.

(c)   Explain how a location determined by cell (mobile) phone technology may
      be different from that determined by a Global Positioning System (GPS). [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Cell (mobile) phone
      • cell (mobile) phone tracking – phone must emit a roaming signal to contact
        a nearby antenna tower, but does not require an active call
      • the technology of locating with a cell (mobile) phone is based on measuring
        power levels and antenna patterns
      • cell (mobile) phones communicate wirelessly with one of the closest
        base stations, so if you know which base station the phone communicates with,
        you know that the phone is close to the respective base station
      • GSM localization is then done by triangulation to locate the
        user/cell (mobile) phone on the basis of the strength of the signals.

      GPS
      • determines precise location
      • the distance to the GPS satellites can be determined by estimating the amount
        of time it takes for their signals to reach the receiver; when the receiver
        estimates the distance to at least four GPS satellites, it can calculate its position
        in three dimensions
      • uses triangulation to calculate the user’s exact location
      • a GPS receiver must be locked on to the signal of at least three satellites
      • GPS receivers are accurate to approximately 15 metres.

      Answers may include:
      • government authorities are required to have a search warrant/court orders/
        subpoenas
      • data requested by government authorities is a matter of national security
      • law enforcement agencies request information to identify or locate a
        suspect/fugitive/witness/missing person
      • a crime has been committed and the data is relevant

      • government authorities collect and process appropriate personal information
        only to the extent that it is needed to fulfil operational needs or to comply with
        any legal requirements
      • organizations ensure that the rights of people about whom information is held
        can be fully exercised under a country’s data protection act
      • organizations have taken appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures to safeguard personal information from unauthorized access
