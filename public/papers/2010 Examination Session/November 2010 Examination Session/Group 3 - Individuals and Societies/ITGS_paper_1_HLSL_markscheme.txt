Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.


1.   (a)   Define the term multitasking.                                                       [2 marks]

           • more than one program/process
           • is (apparently) being executed at the same time
           • control shifts between processes very rapidly

(c)   A company is considering changing the operating system that it uses
      on its PCs to Linux, which is free open source software. Explain reasons why
      a company might choose to pay for commercial software rather than obtain
      it free.                                                                     [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • free software may lack compatibility with other users/business partners
      • free applications are different from commercial applications
      • free applications may not be well tested
      • free applications may have less features
      • retraining may be required
      • there may be resistance from users
      • commercial – availability of support
      • commercial – might carry a guarantee.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description, although the answer may lack appropriate reasoning
      at the lower end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed explanation of the issue with reasons.

           • may be used to help a hacker access a system remotely.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe two ways in which keylogging software could make its logged data
           available to a remotely located observer.                                 [4 marks]

           Answers may include:

           • data is wirelessly transmitted – by means of an attached hardware system
           • any reference to P2P methods or example of file sharing software (if in doubt,
             look it up on Wikipedia)
           • it allows the observer to log into the local machine – via the Internet
             or Ethernet, and access the logs stored on the target machine.

           Do not allow just “Internet” or “network”.
