                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   Outline two advantages for Alejandra’s father of changing the legal status of
           LCS from a sole trader to a private limited company.                          [4 marks]

           Advantages of changing legal status from a sole trader include:
           • investors such as Alejandra and her father have limited liability, which is to say
             that their liability is limited to their investment in the company
           • as a private limited company has a legal existence separate from the owners,
             it increases the likelihood of a successful continuity in the event of the death of
             one of the principals/principal shareholders
           • ownership of the company can be more easily transferred (note that Alejandra
             purchases additional shares every year)
           • shares can provide an additional source of compensation, which may be
             appropriate in the case of LCS
           • with a private limited company, there is a convenient legal structure (selling
             shares) to raise additional equity capital
           • banks, trade creditors and other external sources of finance are generally more
             likely to lend money/provide finance to private limited companies.


           Accept any other relevant advantage outlined.


           Award [1 mark] for each relevant advantage identified of changing legal status
           to a private limited company up to [2 marks]. For each advantage identified
           (up to two), award an additional [1 mark] if the advantage is briefly explained or
           summarized, is appropriate to the circumstances of LCS, and the candidate
           has made explicit reference to the stimulus material up to [2 marks]. Award a
           maximum of [4 marks].

(b)   (i)   Prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for the first six months of
            operation of the new wholesale facility of LCS.                  [6 marks]

            * Monthly charges: telephone, rent, debt repayment, insurance and
              miscellaneous.


            [1 mark]
            The candidate conveys some understanding of what a cash-flow forecast is,
            but otherwise the forecast is largely inaccurate, incomplete, or illegible.

            [2 to 3 marks]
            A cash-flow forecast is drawn, but either it is not in a generally accepted
            format or it is untidy, and the forecast contains two or more errors.

            [4 to 5 marks]
            The cash-flow forecast is drawn essentially correctly and neatly in a
            generally accepted format. Award [5 marks] if there is one error,
            [4 marks] if there are two errors. If the candidate produces an accurate
            cash-flow forecast (that is, the final closing balance is correct and the means
            by which the candidate arrived at that figure is clear and logical) but does
            not use a generally accepted format, award [5 marks].

            [6 marks]
            The cash-flow forecast is drawn accurately and neatly in a generally
            accepted format, and is error free. Candidates may round figures, as is
            done here, but are not required to.

            Do not penalize a response more than once for errors that are carried
            forward.

(ii)   Comment on the impact that the new wholesale facility will have on the
       current cash position and cash flow of LCS.                            [5 marks]

       The impact of the new location on LCS appears positive in the long run,
       assuming that her forecasted sales materialize rather quickly. After
       expenses, the company has positive cash flow on a monthly basis and by the
       end of six months is averaging over US$1000 a month. In the short run,
       the cash position of LCS will be much lower, as in the first month of the
       new location there will be a net cash outflow of US$9550, reducing the
       company’s total cash to less than US$5000. This may be less of a reserve
       than the company is accustomed to or is comfortable with. Moreover,
       these are forecasts. The actual net cash flow could be lower. Until the new
       location is fully established and the debt is paid off, LCS may struggle both
       to pay off the debt and pay US$12 000 a year in dividends. For Alejandra
       personally, suspension of the dividends might not be a problem; she has
       her salary. For her father, however, this might be a concern.


       [1 to 3 marks]
       The answer is basic and does not question the accuracy or reliability of
       cash-flow projections or if the candidate fails to recognize that the trend of
       the cash-flow forecast is negative. For [3 marks] there is recognition that
       the cash flow is positive but reduces the company’s total cash.

       [4 to 5 marks]
       The candidate recognizes that the cash-flow projections, and extrapolations
       therefrom for the months following, suggest that the new facility will have a
       net cash flow that reduces the company’s total cash and that they need to
       take into consideration the loan repayments, which may have to be paid by
       the established LCS location until the new facility becomes more
       established.

(c)   Examine two financial rewards LCS could use to “encourage effective
      leadership and strong performance by the senior butcher”.           [5 marks]

      Financial rewards available to LCS to encourage effective leadership and strong
      performance could include:
      • commissions based upon sales volume
      • salary increases based upon sustained sales volume and low employee turnover
         (performance-related pay)
      • shares in the company (some type of share-ownership scheme)
      • some form of profit-related pay.

      The purpose of rewards such as these are to give the senior butcher some sort of
      figurative or literal ownership in the company – that is, to elevate the interest in
      the senior butcher to a level higher than merely someone collecting a salary.
      Rewards based upon sales volume alone expands volume, but LCS runs the risk
      that the senior butcher will not focus on other aspects of the business. If the
      reward is based upon sales volume and low employee turnover, the senior butcher
      then has to consider more aspects of the business than sales. However,
      sometimes there is employee turnover that is beyond the control of the manager
      and this may be a disincentive to the senior butcher that his salary increases are
      linked to external factors. Share of the company would give the senior butcher
      literal ownership of the company, but Alejandra would lose some ownership in
      the company. Profit-sharing has many advantages, in that it gives the senior
      butcher an interest in the company’s success and is tied to profits (which in theory
      include all the costs of a business, including human resource practices that
      influence turnover). Alejandra would also not have to give up ownership in
      the company. However, profit-sharing is usually governed by a contract and,
      if profits soared, LCS might have to pay more in profit-sharing than it
      would prefer.

      Each of the above rewards has advantages and disadvantages. Alejandra should
      select the one that has the best fit with the overall aims of the business.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no examination, award a
      maximum of [3 marks]. If only one financial reward is examined, award a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   With reference to ThaiModa and Sleek Textiles, outline two differences
           between a strategic alliance and a joint venture.                      [4 marks]

           Differences between a strategic alliance and a joint venture include:
           • Whereas strategic alliances usually have legal standing (that is, there is some
              documented understanding of the relationship between strategic partners:
              “Both companies agreed to sell each other’s products in their showrooms and
              share their design resources in Thailand. ThaiModa also uses Sleek Textiles’
              extensive international sales network, primarily in Austria, Australia, Germany
              and Malaysia”), a joint venture will have a legal existence separate from the
              organizations or persons forming the venture. In other words, the joint venture
              will legally constitute a new organization and will not be merely a documented
              understanding.
           • Strategic alliances are typically formed when two or more companies can
              achieve synergies without fundamentally changing their individual long-term
              strategies. In the case of ThaiModa and Sleek Textiles, their strategic alliance
              allows each company to grow without changing the strategy of either company.
              Joint ventures are typically created when companies want some aspect of their
              company to go in a new direction (in this case, antibacterial fabrics) and realize
              that they can benefit by sharing expertise and resources with another company
              or companies.
           • Although strategic alliances may be long-term, because they typically do not
              have legal existence apart from the companies involved (as noted above, they
              typically have a legal understanding between companies), they are generally
              easier to enter and easier to exit. If ThaiModa found that it was getting no
              benefit from its strategic alliance with Sleek Textiles, it would get out of the
              relationship easily. Joint ventures, on the other hand, involve the creation of a
              new legal entity (the joint venture) and are typically more difficult to terminate,
              as the new legal entity will have legal obligations, such as debt and leased
              space, that require complicated negotiations for resolution.

           Accept any other relevant difference outlined.


           Award [1 mark] for each difference between a strategic alliance and a
           joint venture that the candidate identifies, up to [2 marks]. For each difference
           identified, award an additional [1 mark] if the difference is briefly explained or
           summarized, is appropriate to the circumstances of the stimulus material,

      Award [1 mark] each for the calculation of (X) creditors, (Y) net assets, and
      (Z) total current assets. Maximum award for calculations: [3 marks].

      In terms of layout, award [4 marks] for a fully accurate and fully labelled balance
      sheet that conforms to the layout in the guide. If the balance sheet balances but
      the order of the assets or liabilities is slightly inaccurate (according to the
      generally accepted method the candidate has chosen), award [3 marks]. If the
      balance sheet balances but the order of the assets or liabilities is significantly
      inaccurate, such as placing share capital and retained profit as a liability,
      award [2 marks]. Award [1 mark] if the candidate conveys some understanding
      of a balance sheet and some sense that assets equal liabilities + owners’ equity.

      Candidates do not have to list total current assets or total current liabilities as
      separate lines.

             Award [1 mark] for the correct calculation. Apply Own Figure Rule
             (OFR).

      (iii) Using these ratios, briefly comment on the liquidity position of
            ThaiModa.                                                        [2 marks]

             A manufacturing company should typically have a current ratio between 1.5
             and 2 and an acid test ratio greater than 1. ThaiModa certainly has an
             acceptable level of liquidity despite its significant investment in inventory.


             Award [1 mark] if the candidate notes that the liquidity is strong but
             provides no basis for that assertion or makes no other relevant or
             meaningful commentary.

             Award [2 marks] if the candidate assesses the liquidity position favourably
             and provides some basis for that judgment or notes that ThaiModa has a
             strong liquidity position despite its significant investment in inventory or
             makes some other relevant and meaningful commentary on the liquidity.

(d)   Examine one possible advantage and one possible disadvantage for ThaiModa
      of the joint venture with Sleek Textiles.                                 [5 marks]

      In forming a joint venture, ThaiModa will benefit from Sleek Textiles’ expertise in
      the textile industry, including a human resource pool that has knowledge of the
      textile industry, production facilities (or, if a new production facility has to be
      built, established contacts with companies that supply textile manufacturers),
      expertise in the actual production of cloth (once the new fabric is developed), and
      insight/infrastructure for marketing the new textiles. ThaiModa will enjoy the
      advantages of growth without having to lose its identity, both ThaiModa and
      Sleek Textiles can specialize in their respective areas of business while avoiding
      the high legal and administrative costs of a takeover.

      However, some joint ventures do not achieve the desired results. Sometimes in
      joint ventures, compromises are made that are not ideal for either company
      individually or for the joint venture (which, had a takeover occurred, the
      purchasing company would and could act more decisively in terms of achieving
      its objectives). As with any partnership, disagreements can occur. ThaiModa or
      Sleek Textiles might regret the partnership were either one to conclude, after the
      fact, that it could have been as or more profitable without the joint venture.

      Accept any other relevant possible advantage and disadvantage examined.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no examination, award a
      maximum of [3 marks]. If only one possible advantage or disadvantage is
      examined, award a maximum of [3 marks].

3.   (a)   Describe one marketing advantage for Cyprus Tours of owning its own cars.              [2 marks]

           Examples of marketing advantages for Cyprus Tours of owning its own cars
           include:
           • price: Cyprus Tours will have greater control over the price of transport and
              can adjust price according to its strategic needs
           • promotion: Cyprus Tours could have the company’s name, logo, and contact
              information on the vehicles, thus providing a form of promotion
           • product: owning the vehicles itself and providing its own drivers, Cyprus Tours
              has greater control over the quality of the vehicles and the service
           • people: the drivers of the vehicles, as employees of Cyprus Tours, can be
              proactive and positive representatives of the company and can cross-sell
              products and services.

           Accept any other relevant marketing advantage.


           Award [1 mark] for an appropriate and correct marketing advantage identified and
           [2 marks] for a correct description that includes specific reference to the stimulus
           material. If there is no reference to the stimulus material, award no more than
           [1 mark].

(c)   Analyse the usefulness for Cyprus Tours of using the payback period and the
      average rate of return (ARR) methods for investment appraisal.              [5 marks]

      For Cyprus Tours, as for any company, the payback method is simple to use and it
      lets the company know how quickly the investment will be repaid. This is
      especially helpful when technologies are changing rapidly and the investment is
      subject to technological obsolescence. Also, although the payback method does
      not refer specifically to paying back external sources of funds, almost certainly
      Cyprus Tours will have to borrow money to purchase the vehicles and, in some
      sense, the payback method will correspond to debt repayment. For small
      companies like Cyprus Tours, without a broad range of revenue streams, this can
      give some peace of mind – knowing when the investment/debt will be repaid.
      A drawback to the payback method is that it does not take into account cash
      earned after the payback nor the profitability of the investment considered.

      The average rate of return (ARR), on the other hand, will clearly show
      Cyprus Tours the profitability of the investment. That way, Cyprus Tours can
      compare the investment of funds in the vehicles to other possible investments.
      ARR does not take into account the time value of money.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis, award a
      maximum of [3 marks]. If the usefulness of only one investment appraisal is
      analysed, award a maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss whether Cyprus Tours should purchase the hybrid cars.                        [7 marks]

      Cyprus Tours’ decision whether to purchase hybrid cars depends on the
      company’s commitment to social responsibility and their estimation of the validity
      of their forecasts.

      From the point of view of social responsibility, unquestionably the company
      should purchase the hybrids, which are better for the environment and reduce
      Cyprus Tour’s dependence on imported oil. Furthermore, the people of
      Cyprus want to preserve the environment of their small island not only for its
      own sake, but also for tourism, which is one of the most important industries
      in Cyprus. Cyprus Tours might be in a position to use hybrids for marketing
      purposes, as many consumers at least claim to be committed to “going green”.

      On the other hand, saving €100 000 over six years is a significant saving for a
      small business. Moreover, were the forecasts too optimistic and the profits from
      the vehicles lower, the burden of the additional cost of the hybrids could pose a
      real problem for the company. The company would, nevertheless, have to
      consider the potential damage in the marketplace it would suffer from using
      petrol-only cars. If the pressure groups focused on specific companies, and
      Cyprus Tours were one of them, the negative publicity could hurt the company.
      Also, purchasing the hybrid cars would result in redundancies and reduced
      bonuses in order to fund the initial investment, which may subsequently reduce
      employee motivation and morale.

      One alternative would be to purchase five petrol-only cars and five hybrids.
      This way, the company could achieve some savings from the less expensive
      petrol-only cars, while also demonstrating, to some degree, its social
      responsibility.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no discussion, award a
      maximum of [4 marks].

4.   (a)   Define the term job production.                                                [2 marks]

           Job production refers to the process of production whereby each order (job)
           is manufactured when the order comes in and according to the individual
           specifications of the order (thus each order is a one-off). Job production typically
           involves products that are expensive and are designed according to the particular
           needs and wants of a specific buyer.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   (i)   With reference to MKD, distinguish between fixed costs and variable
                 costs.                                                              [4 marks]

                 Fixed costs are costs that do not vary with output; variable costs do.
                 Compared to traditional house construction companies, MKD has higher
                 fixed costs and lower variable costs. The higher fixed costs stem from
                 the fact that the company maintains a factory, which has fixed costs such
                 as rent, which do not change regardless of output. By using a factory,
                 however, the company is able to build modules/the houses more
                 efficiently, thus lowering the variable costs of the company (expenses
                 such as petrol, wages, materials (due to less waste), etc.).

                 Accept any other relevant answer.


                 If the candidate demonstrates some understanding between fixed and
                 variable costs, but their understanding is vague or imprecise and they
                 make no reference to the stimulus material, award [1 mark].

                 For [2 marks] or more the candidate must convey the idea, however
                 worded, that variable costs change with output while fixed costs do not.

                 For [2 to 3 marks], the candidate demonstrates understanding, but the
                 application to the stimulus material may be limited, the response may
                 lack balance, or there may be some lack of clarity.

                 For [4 marks], the candidate clearly distinguishes between fixed and
                 variable costs (and includes the idea of output) and explains the
                 distinction clearly in terms of the specifics of MKD.

      (ii)   Explain one reason why it is important for MKD to strengthen its
             brand.                                                           [2 marks]

             One reason could include:
             • With the competition in the market, MKD needs to raise awareness of the
               brand for a competitive edge, especially during the severe downturn in
               the market.

             Other reasons could include that branding:
             • creates product awareness
             • can relay a product’s performance
             • helps to ensure customers will remember a company and can create
               brand loyalty
             • makes marketing so much easier
             • promotes sales.

             Accept any other relevant explanation.


             Award [1 mark] for a relevant and appropriate reason identified, and
             [1 mark] for a relevant and appropriate explanation of the reason, up to
             [2 marks].

(c)   With reference to MKD, analyse the role of a mission statement and a
      vision statement.                                                    [5 marks]

      A mission statement conveys the fundamental purpose of the organization.
      It defines critical processes and allows the company and customers to know the
      meaningful and measurable criteria of the company, thus allowing some
      understanding of the desired level of performance. A vision statement is loftier,
      more abstract. It outlines what the organization wants to be, or how it wants the
      world in which it operates to be. It concentrates on the future. It is a source of
      inspiration.

      Both mission and vision statements provide clear decision-making criteria.
      Because MKD’s mission and vision powerfully outline socially responsible
      objectives, the mission and vision statements are crucially important tools
      providing guidance, primarily to Michelle and her employees but also to all
      stakeholders. The company’s commitment to green construction and green
      processes is constantly being challenged by merely the fact that non-green options
      are available everywhere and at lower cost. Pressure is further added because
      some of the clients/potential clients are pressuring the company to make
      compromises. The company can constantly turn to their mission and vision
      statements to help make decisions, assuming everyone in the company buys into
      them.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis, award a
      maximum of [3 marks]. If the role of only a mission or a vision statement is
      analysed, award a maximum of [3 marks].

(d)   Discuss whether Michelle should start using “non-environmentally friendly
      materials to keep prices down”.                                           [7 marks]

      Although for some companies the question of whether to “go green” is open, for a
      company such as MKD, it is less so. To be sure, making some compromises on
      materials would not entirely vitiate the company’s commitment to “Making green
      architecture affordable to everyone”. Also, some might argue that making
      “semi-green” architecture affordable is still laudable.      Nonetheless, once
      compromises were made, the company’s commitment to being green would be
      weakened and could lead to further erosion of its vision and mission statement.
      Moreover, the company would open itself to charges of hypocrisy by any
      competitors who were not making such compromises. To be consistent with both
      the vision statement and the mission statement of the company, MKD must
      continue to strive to live by its principles. The downturn in the United States
      (USA) housing market has probably put real pressure on Michelle, and perhaps
      the only justification for making compromises on materials used would be if the
      very existence of the company were at stake.

5.   (a)   Outline the importance of innovation for Café Paradise.                                [2 marks]

           Innovation is the commercial use of new inventions or processes. For
           Café Paradise, innovation has been important on two occasions in the business,
           the first when Imran transformed his business into an Internet café and now,
           at the current stage, when he is determining the next phase of the business.
           In both instances, new technologies, first the Internet and second Wi-Fi,
           have played a major role in his decision to innovate and, in both instances,
           the decisions regarding innovation had and will have an important impact on
           the success of the business.


           Award [1 mark] for a general statement about innovation in business that
           demonstrates some understanding of the concept. Award [2 marks] for a brief
           explanation or summary of the importance of innovation for Café Paradise.

     (b)   Explain the effect of one political, one economic and one social factor on
           Café Paradise.                                                             [6 marks]

           Political factors referred to in the stimulus material include the Moroccan
           government’s commitment to making computer use easier by having Wi-Fi
           available in major cities and a provincial governor issuing warnings about a
           certain pressure group, a sign that governmental action could be a factor
           restricting access to certain web sites. The first will increase personal and laptop
           computer use, thereby decreasing demand for Internet cafés. If the government
           restricts web site access, that could further reduce demand for Internet cafés.

           An economic factor referred to in the stimulus material is the downturn in the
           economy. A weaker economy could mean that consumers have less money for
           discretionary uses, like going out to a café. On the other hand, with less money
           for discretionary spending, consumers may delay the purchase of a major item,
           like a computer, and continue to use Internet cafés.

           Social factors referred to in the stimulus material include increased usage of
           personal computers by Moroccans, who are increasingly knowledgeable about
           computers (innovation), and potentially growing concern about access to certain
           web sites. As even more Moroccans use computers on a regular basis, they will
           tend toward owning their own, reducing the need for “traditional” Internet cafés.
           However, there could be some backlash against computer use by the more socially
           conservative members of society.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.


           Mark as 2+2+2.

           Award [1 mark] for identification of a political factor, [1 mark] for an economic
           factor, and [1 mark] for a social factor. Award an additional mark for each factor
           identified when the candidate explains its effect on Café Paradise. Do not award
           marks for the identification of a second political, economic, or social factor.

(c)   Analyse the relationship between investment, profit and cash flow at
      Café Paradise.                                                       [5 marks]

      There is a clear relationship between investment, profit, and cash flow at
      Café Paradise. Imran’s decision to transform his café into an Internet café,
      a decision that required investment in computers and presumably some
      modification to the set-up of the café, led to several years of high profits. Now,
      as circumstances have changed and profits have diminished, he must consider his
      next investment option, whether to buy new computers or to transform his café
      into a next-generation café. Whichever way the business goes, it will be Imran’s
      intention to see an increase in profits. Regardless of which path he chooses, in the
      short term he will probably experience some cash flow challenges. Revenues will
      rise, but in terms of cash position or cash flow, it will take several years to recoup
      the investment.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Evaluate Akila’s recommendation for the future direction of Café Paradise.               [7 marks]

      There are many strengths to Akila’s recommendation. The “boom years” for
      Internet cafés are clearly over in the major cities of Morocco, as many individuals
      now possess their own computers. Even if the business could earn enough profit
      to pay for the computers, the profitability from “traditional” Internet cafés is not
      what it formerly was and will probably never be again. Akila’s suggestion
      requires a significantly lower capital investment and the business will have
      substantially reduced operating expenses (laying-off the two remaining part-time
      employees).

      On the other hand, with their established customer base accustomed to an
      Internet café, they may find that if they no longer offer computer access, they may
      lose many customers. Also, with the economy in recession, it is possible that the
      sale of personal computers will slow and there will continue to be demand for
      Internet cafés. With the Internet café “industry” in decline, possibly other
      Internet cafés are closing, reducing competition, which might give further life to
      Café Paradise’s current business model.

      The Kwashanes should conduct a thorough marketing analysis to determine
      which action to take.

      Accept any other relevant evaluation.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no evaluation, award a
      maximum of [4 marks].
