Answer all parts of the question.

                                         Area of impact: Business and employment

1.    The recording industry is taking court action against private individuals and peer-to-peer (P2P)*
      file sharing services that are involved in the illegal downloading of music files.

      A US federal jury has found a woman guilty of sharing copyrighted music online,
      and ordered her to pay US$222  000 in damages to the six record companies represented by the
      Recording Industry Association of America.

      The woman had downloaded 24 songs without permission and shared them online through
      a P2P file sharing account.  However, the woman denied the charges and testified that she did not have
      an account.  During the trial, the woman’s Internet service provider (ISP) presented evidence that
      copyrighted songs were offered by the woman as a P2P file sharing user under the name “tereastarr”.

      *     peer-to-peer (P2P): technology that allows Internet users to locate each other through the use
                                of an online server and exchange files directly between their computers




      (a)       Identify two characteristics of a P2P network.                                                          [2 marks]

      (b)       Users of illegal P2P file sharing networks run the risk of downloading viruses.  
                Describe one indication that a computer has a virus and one preventative measure
                that a user can take to avoid viruses on their computer.                                                [4 marks]

      (c)       Explain two kinds of evidence that could have been presented in court
                to prove that copyrighted songs were offered by the woman using a
                P2P file sharing account.                                                                               [4 marks]

      (d)       A range of online solutions have been developed to provide customers with legal
                access to music files.

                To what extent have online solutions been made available to meet
                customers’ needs?  Use specific examples in your response.                                             [10 marks]

Answer two questions.

                                         area of impact: education

2.    video game books illustrated with computer-generated images are the latest attempt to encourage
      students to enjoy reading. Project X books have been designed to appeal to children up to the age
      of nine and have been tested in over 2000 schools. Some schools bought Project X CD-ROMs
      for students to use in a class on individual laptops. Other schools display the CD-ROM from
      the teacher’s laptop on a smartboard.




      Each CD-ROM contains stories brought to life on the screen using page-turning technology
      with images, audio, animations and video clips. Students can use a full range of tools to explore
      and annotate the text. A character image collection and writing frames are provided to support
      children’s writing.

      Project X has been both a creative and technical challenge. All the characters and environments
      have been built from start to finish. Every visible object in the illustrations had to be modelled
      and textured. Unique skeleton figures enable the characters to move and create a believable world.

(Question 2 continued)

      (a)   Identify two types of software licence a school may need to consider when
            purchasing the CD-ROMs.                                                          [2 marks]

      (c)   Interactive multimedia productions are often stored as compressed files
            to reduce storage space.  Explain two disadvantages of using data compression
            for this purpose.                                                                [4 marks]

      (d)   The head of a primary school has decided to invest in Project X technology
            rather than in sets of printed reading books.  Evaluate this decision.          [10 marks]

                                          Area of impact: Health

3.    Until recently, the occurrence of illnesses was tracked using only traditional methods.  
      One method for tracking the spread of influenza (flu) in the United States relies on a network
      of more than 1500 doctors who treat 16 million patients each year.  The doctors record the percentage
      of their patients who have a flu-like illness.  The US health agency and state health departments collect
      and analyse this data on a weekly basis.   It usually takes one to two weeks until all of the data
      is collected and the results are released to the public.

      However, Google plans to develop a software tool, Google Flu Trends, for the
      US government.   The system uses data gathered from web searches for flu-related keywords
      to notify the US health agency of where an outbreak of the illness could be happening.  
      When Google Flu Trends was tested, it was found that there is a close relationship between how
      many people search for flu-related topics in a geographical area and how many people actually have
      flu symptoms.

      Private individuals can use similar online trend tools to analyse other health issues by searching
      for terms, locations or time regions.   For example, the following chart shows the comparison
      for the search term “skin cancer” in the United Kingdom (bottom line) and Australia (top line),
      from 2004 to 2009.
                                                                                                      Download
                                                                                                      CSV files




                                         [Source: www.google.com/trends.]


      The information generated by the search can be downloaded by the user in the form of
      a csv file (comma separated values), which contains some ASCII characters.

      (a)   Identify two characteristics of ASCII.                                           [2 marks]

      (b)   Describe the steps by which Google Flu Trends could associate flu-related
            keywords entered by users within the United States to the occurrence of flu
            in the various regions.                                                          [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain why an Internet search engine would get different results when
            skin cancer (without quotation marks) is entered and when “skin cancer”
            (with quotation marks) is entered.                                               [4 marks]

      (d)   To what extent should analysis tools such as Google Flu Trends be used
            as the main providers of information for governments and health organizations
            in planning resources to manage illnesses?                                      [10 marks]

4.    Sarah Warner has started to learn the guitar as a leisure activity.   Unable to find a local teacher,
      Sarah searches the Internet and makes contact with Carlos Martinez, a music teacher in Paraguay
      who is offering his services online.   Carlos is using a new three-dimensional (3D) web cam and
      broadcasting on Skype, an audio/videoconferencing program, to teach guitar lessons.   He has a
      Minoru 3D web cam which connects to his personal computer’s (PC) USB port, just like any
      other web cam.  Carlos can log into his Skype account and broadcast his lessons to students online.  
      His students can ask questions and Carlos can comment on their guitar playing in real-time
      through Skype.

      The Minoru 3D web cam is a single piece of hardware with two cameras spaced approximately
      the same distance apart as human eyes, which make the user tend to look into the
      eyes of the camera.   The Minoru 3D web cam can be used for videoconferencing
      with programs such as Windows Live Messenger and Skype.   It can record 3D videos for posting
      on video web sites.  It can also be used as a normal web cam, recording video or taking still pictures.




      Carlos has had to install Skype and the software supporting the Minoru 3D web cam.

      Students such as Sarah only need to purchase special coloured glasses in order to view the lessons
      in 3D.  She also needs to purchase a basic web cam and install Skype in order for Carlos to see and
      hear her play her guitar.

            of interactive online learning environments will never satisfactorily replace
            face-to-face contact”?                                                            [10 marks]

5.    David Hanson, Chief Executive of Hanson Robotics Inc, is a leader in creating robots that are among
      the most advanced in the world. He has created Jules, an example of a “social robot” that uses
      artificial intelligence, integration of natural language processing, automatic speech recognition
      and text-to-speech. It is possible to have a natural, interactive conversation with Jules.
      Frubber is an elastic material that has been developed by Hanson Robotics Inc which looks like
      natural skin and makes Jules’ realistic facial movement and speech possible.

      Jules also uses “computer vision” through a device in his eye which captures the image of the person
      talking to him. “Computer vision” includes face recognition and face tracking to simulate complete
      verbal and non-verbal interaction, such as maintaining eye contact and turning the head to follow the
      movement of the human to whom Jules is talking.

      David Hanson also teaches his robots their history, vocabulary, and develops their basic
      “personality”, either based on a real person or an imaginary character. Hanson’s robots have been used
      in games and toys, research and psychiatry scenarios, military training and animations.

            uses its own cameras to analyse the game and then communicates its decisions
            to the human spectators using speech.

6.    Free microblogging services have become very popular, allowing millions of users to
      send messages and read other users’ messages.   The text-only messages may be up to
      a maximum of 140 characters in length.   Users can choose to “follow” someone,
      allowing them to view all of the posted messages from this person, their details, and access their other
      “followers” directly. Messages can be sent and received  using the  services’s website, by SMS, RSS,
      or e-mail.

      While a user is logged into a microblogging website, information about them is automatically
      recorded by the site’s server in a data log which includes: IP address, browser type, the web pages
      visited by the user, the search terms used, and any advertisements on which the user clicks.  The
      server uses administrative, physical and electronic measures to protect the user’s personal
      information and personal messages from unauthorized access.

      A US Army intelligence report has identified that terrorists may be using a combination of social
      networking and microblogging services, Global Positioning System (GPS) with online maps and
      voice-changing software as potential terrorism tools.  Terrorists may be using social networking in
      the following ways:
      • Cell (mobile) phones for the mass sending of propaganda
      • Cell (mobile) GPS for terrorist targeting
      • Cell (mobile) phones as surveillance tools
      • Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone calls
      • Microblogging sites to communicate and integrate other tools, such as online maps, in messages
