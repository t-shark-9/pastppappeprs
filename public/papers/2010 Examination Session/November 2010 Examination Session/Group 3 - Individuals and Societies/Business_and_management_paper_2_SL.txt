                                                             SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    La Carnicería Sanitaria (LCS)

      Alejandra Morales manages a meat wholesale* business in the southern side of Panama City,
      Panama. The business was set up by her father. When he retired, he changed the legal status from a
      sole trader to a private limited company. Every year Alejandra uses her personal savings to purchase
      an additional 5 % of her father’s shares. The firm is profitable, has an average monthly positive cash
      flow of US$1200 (after paying Alejandra’s monthly salary), no debts, and presently has a US$14 000
      cash balance. The present policy of the firm is to pay dividends of US$12 000 each year.

      Alejandra wants to open a new wholesale facility in the northern side of the city in January 2011.
      According to her business plan she would need to rent a building and purchase new equipment.
       To finance the new equipment, she will obtain a US$60 000 bank loan which must be repaid in
        five years.
       Alejandra forecasts sales of US$10 000 in January 2011 and she expects sales to grow by 2 %
        per month for the following six months.
       Sales will be on credit with customers required to pay in 30 days.

      Forecasted cash outflows of La Carnicería Sanitaria (LCS) at the new wholesale facility for the first
      six months (January to June 2011) will include:
                                                                         US$
       Monthly purchase from meat suppliers       the purchase price (paid in cash) is equivalent to

(Question 1 continued)

      When Alejandra makes the proposal to open the new wholesale facility, her father still has 60 %
      ownership of LCS. He is concerned that Alejandra is too optimistic with her sales forecasts.

      To encourage effective leadership and strong performance by the senior butcher at the new
      wholesale facility, Alejandra is considering a range of financial rewards.


      (a)   Outline two advantages for Alejandra’s father of changing the legal status of
            LCS from a sole trader to a private limited company.                                [4 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for the first six months of operation
                   of the new wholesale facility of LCS.                                        [6 marks]

		          (ii)   Comment on the impact that the new wholesale facility will have on the
                   current cash position and cash flow of LCS.                                  [5 marks]

      (c)   Examine two financial rewards LCS could use to “encourage effective
            leadership and strong performance by the senior butcher”.                           [5 marks]

      ThaiModa has 4 production sites and 10 distribution centres in Thailand. Its products are sold in both
      domestic and overseas markets. ThaiModa also sells furniture imported from Italy under the brand
      name “Casaperfetta”.

      In 2002 ThaiModa established a strategic alliance with Sleek Textiles, a manufacturer of
      luxury fabrics. Both companies agreed to sell each other’s products in their showrooms and
      share their design resources in Thailand. ThaiModa also uses Sleek Textiles’ extensive international
      sales network, primarily in Austria, Australia, Germany and Malaysia.



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      In addition to the existing strategic alliance, ThaiModa is now considering a joint venture with
      Sleek Textiles focusing on the development of new antibacterial fabrics. “TMHC” is particularly
      interested in using these new antibacterial fabrics in their furniture for elderly people.

      In 2010, ThaiModa reported a revenue of 30 million Thai baht from “TMHC”. Future sales revenue
      is forecasted to grow rapidly. Sales are mainly to hospitals and hospices. In an aging society,
      there is potential for growth in the market for furniture for elderly people.


      (a)   With reference to ThaiModa and Sleek Textiles, outline two differences
            between a strategic alliance and a joint venture.                               [4 marks]

      (b)   Calculate the missing figures X, Y, Z and with those figures and from the
            financial information provided, construct a complete balance sheet for
            ThaiModa for 2009.                                                              [7 marks]

      (c)   (i)    Calculate the acid test (quick) ratio of ThaiModa.                        [1 mark]

		          (ii)   Calculate the current ratio of ThaiModa.                                  [1 mark]

		          (iii) Using these ratios, briefly comment on the liquidity position of
                  ThaiModa.                                                                 [2 marks]

      (d)   Examine one possible advantage and one possible disadvantage for ThaiModa
            of the joint venture with Sleek Textiles.                                       [5 marks]

                                                          SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Cyprus Tours

      Cyprus Tours, owned and operated by Nikolas Georgiadis, is a travel agency. It arranges
      sightseeing tours for groups of tourists, as well as accommodation and restaurant bookings.
      Tourism is one of the most important industries in Cyprus. Presently, Cyprus Tours hires cars from
      local taxi companies to transport groups of tourists on the island of Cyprus. The hiring of the cars is
      a major expense for Cyprus Tours.

      Nikolas is considering purchasing 10 cars so that Cyprus Tours can transport customers itself.
      The cost of the 10 cars that run on petrol (gasoline) only is €400 000, and the firm forecasts that
      the net profit will increase by €85 000 per annum from the investment. The vehicles will have a
      useful life of 6 years.

      Pressure groups in Cyprus have demanded that all new vehicles be hybrid* in order to reduce
      pollution. At low speed, hybrid cars pollute less. Taxi companies, however, object to the demand
      from the pressure groups. A hybrid car costs 25 % more than a petrol-only car to purchase, and the
      cost difference cannot be passed on to consumers.

      If Nikolas acts immediately, Cyprus Tours can purchase the petrol-only cars before any changes
      in the law. However, his son Dimitri, a university student, objects to purchasing petrol-only cars.
      He argues that businesses have a social responsibility to protect the environment, which also ensures
      the long-term viability of tourism in Cyprus. Nikolas fears that purchasing hybrid cars would put
      a financial burden on the company. Cyprus Tours would have to cut expenses by making several
      booking agents and administrative staff redundant. Cyprus Tours would also have to reduce
      year-end bonuses.



      * hybrid: hybrid vehicles combine the use of electric and petrol power



                                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

      (b)   Calculate, showing all your working:

		          (i)    the payback period and the average rate of return (ARR) for the
                   petrol-only cars.                                                      [3 marks]

		          (ii)   the payback period and the average rate of return (ARR) for the
                   hybrid cars.                                                           [3 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the usefulness for Cyprus Tours of using the payback period and the
            average rate of return (ARR) methods for investment appraisal.                [5 marks]

      (d)   Discuss whether Cyprus Tours should purchase the hybrid cars.                 [7 marks]

4.    Michelle Kaufmann Designs (MKD)

      Michelle Kaufmann Designs (MKD) in San Francisco, USA, is a leader in designing and
      manufacturing modular* houses that are both beautiful and environmentally friendly. Customers
      choose one of six basic MKD models and then further customize the number of bedrooms,
      bathrooms, and the final details. Customers can also decide whether to have solar panels.




                                  [Source: http://www.mkd-arc.com/homes/mksolaire/, 18 February 2009]


      The modules are built in four to six weeks using job production methods in the firm’s factory.
      To be more environmentally friendly, the factory is located near suppliers of the building
      materials. Michelle Kaufmann, owner and founder of MKD, insists that all suppliers operate in an
      environmentally friendly manner. Lorries deliver the modules to the location where the house will
      be built. It then takes another six weeks for the work to be completed.

      The main benefits of buying a MKD house compared to an identical traditionally built house are:
      • it takes a third less time to construct
      • it is of better quality
      • it requires less petrol (gasoline) to transport labour and materials to and from a construction site.

      These benefits fit MKD’s vision statement: “Making green architecture affordable to everyone”.

      The firm’s mission statement includes the firm’s five eco-principles: smart design, eco-materials,
      energy efficiency, water conservation and healthy environment. Michelle hopes to build a brand
      around environmental friendliness and elegant design. She is strengthening her brand by also
      selling books, T-shirts, bags and furniture, all bearing the MKD logo.

      MKD faces several challenges:
      • Americans have negative perceptions of modular houses
      • environmentally friendly houses are more expensive than other houses
      • there is a severe economic downturn and the demand for new houses is falling rapidly
      • price sensitive customers are requesting the use of non-environmentally friendly materials to keep
        prices down
      • it has numerous competitors in the market for environmentally friendly houses.



      * modular: designed with standardized units or dimensions

                                                                      (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 4 continued)

      Although Michelle differentiates her business by being the only one in San Francisco offering
      modular houses, she has higher fixed costs to maintain the factory.

5.    Café Paradise

      In 2002, four years after the first Internet café opened in Morocco, Imran Kwashane transformed
      his traditional café, Café Paradise, located in a suburb of Rabat into an Internet café. Revenue and
      profits grew rapidly. Within a year he had hired three part-time employees to help customers use the
      café’s computers.

      Many entrepreneurs were opening Internet cafés in Morocco. Soon there were 2500 Internet cafés.
      Facing strong competition, in 2005, Imran lowered his price of Internet access from six to
      four dirhams per hour. Revenue fell, and, despite cutting costs by making one employee redundant,
      profits were lower than before. Moreover, in late 2008, following a decade of economic growth,
      Morocco’s economy went into recession.

      When Café Paradise first opened, there were no government restrictions on Internet cafés
      in Morocco. The national government was actually encouraging computer use by upgrading
      the country’s information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and providing free
      wireless access (Wi-Fi) services in major cities like Rabat. As a result, sales of computers,
      especially laptops, increased by 10 % per year between 2000 and 2007. However, a provincial
      government official has recently instructed local Internet cafés not to serve customers belonging
      to a banned pressure group. Many Moroccans also believe that there should be more control over

      Internet café customers, increasingly knowledgeable about innovations in information technologies,
      have begun to demand newer, faster computers. As Café Paradise’s computers are seven
      years old, Imran is considering purchasing 15 new computers at a cost of 150 000 dirhams.
      His wife Akila, however, thinks that the first generation Internet café sector will soon not be
      financially viable. Rather than buying new computers, she recommends modernizing the décor*
      (at a cost of 60 000 dirhams), laying-off the two remaining part-time employees, and providing
      extra services such as scanning and printing photos for customers with laptops or memory sticks.
