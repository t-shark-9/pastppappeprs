                                            SECTION A

1.   (a)   N-Pharma is now a successful business, but it initially struggled: “poor cash
           flow meant that the early years were financially challenging” (lines 6–7).
           Outline two problems that Yukio Nakamura’s business start-up may have
           faced.                                                                        [4 marks]

           Problems that Yukio’s business start-up may have faced include:
           • a limited budget available for research and development (R&D) (critical in that
              industry: line 20)
           • a limited budget available for promotion and advertising
           • a limited, erratic or unreliable income
           • a lack of customer base
           • difficulties in finding external sources of finance (such as investors or bank
              loans)
           • difficulties in planning strategically
           • accept any other relevant problem outlined.


           Mark as 2+2.

           N.B. Do not credit the sentence “poor cash flow meant that the early years were
           financially challenging” alone because this is just a direct quote from the case
           study (lines 6–7).

           Each problem may be awarded up to [2 marks].

           Award [1 mark] for a basic outline of each possible problem, conveying partial
           knowledge and understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a clear outline of each possible problem, conveying
           knowledge and understanding through exemplification or application to the case
           study.

(b)   Construct a fully labelled Ansoff matrix to show N-Pharma’s possible
      growth strategies.                                                   [4 marks]

      The Ansoff matrix is as follows:

                            Existing products         New products
         Existing markets




                                 Market                 Product
                               penetration            development
         New markets




                                Market                Diversification
                              development




      N-Pharma already uses or could use the four strategies:
      • ongoing product development (lines 20–27)
      • option 1: market development in Europe (lines 121–136)
      • option 2: market penetration within China (lines 137–147)
      • option 3: diversification (lines 148–153).


      The breakdown of marks is as follows: up to [2 marks] for the theory (or Ansoff
      matrix), and up to [2 marks] for application to the case study.

      Award up to [2 marks] for an accurate, fully labelled presentation of the Ansoff
      matrix – only [1 mark] if one term is absent or not correct.

      Award an additional [2 marks] for the application to N-Pharma – only [1 mark]
      if one of the strategies is absent or not correct.

(c)   Analyse the value of “social and environmental audits” (line 107) to
      N-Pharma.                                                            [7 marks]

      It has become common for large companies to carry out social and environmental
      audits because of an increasing awareness, by all stakeholders, of the social and
      environmental impacts that large companies have on local communities and on
      the environment.

      In the case of N-Pharma, some other factors explain why Tadashi plans to carry
      out such audits:
      • N-Pharma operates in an industry which has been criticised for its lack of
         conscience and social responsibility, being more motivated by money than by
         healthcare and polluting through chemicals
      • N-Pharma itself has suffered PR problems and a poor image because of some
         of its practices
      • N-Pharma employs over 30 000 staff globally (line 2), so it directly affects
         thousands of households (any restructuring such as closing one subsidiary
         would have substantial socio-economic impacts on local communities).

      However, such social and environmental audits present some drawbacks too:
      • they can be expensive (especially in a period of recession when some staff
        may fear for their jobs and would not understand why substantial amounts
        would be spent to employ auditors and consultants rather than on the core
        business of N-Pharma)
      • they can be seen as unreliable or biased (as they are commissioned by
        N-Pharma which expects certain results); they may seem little more than a
        PR/communication exercise
      • their results may be difficult to implement.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated analysis.

2.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    span of control (line 60)                                                    [2 marks]

                  Span of control refers to the number of people under a given manager.
                  The more people under the control of one manager, the wider the span of
                  control.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the case study award
                  [1 mark].

           (ii)   empowerment (line 64).                                                       [2 marks]

                  Empowerment is a HR practice that consists of allowing employees to
                  make autonomous decisions without consulting their line manager. One aim
                  is to help employees develop a sense of ownership over their work and to
                  take responsibility for their results. It also gives managers more time to
                  concentrate on other strategic and/or operational issues.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and

                                             –9–               N10/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Comment on the effectiveness of Susan James’ leadership style in the
      Canadian subsidiary of N-Pharma.                                     [4 marks]

      Susan’s leadership style can be defined as autocratic as she tends to impose her
      decisions without listening to employees’ requests and desires (she has “dismissed
      requests for greater empowerment” (line 64), she seems unable to communicate
      with them (line 67)).

      On the one hand, that style may seem ineffective as it is exacerbating the tensions
      between employees and direction at the Canadian subsidiary (threats of industrial
      action and strike (line 65)). This is rather the view from the employees who are
      unhappy with Susan’s leadership style.

      On the other hand, that style may be effective as strict measures must be
      implemented in order to redress the productivity problems (“the Canadian
      subsidiary has recently suffered lower levels of productivity compared to other
      N-Pharma subsidiaries” (lines 60–61)). Only an autocratic leadership style may
      result in productivity improvements. This is rather the view from Yukio and the
      directors at the N-Pharma headquarters, which is why they appointed Susan.

      Accept any other relevant answer.


      [1 to 2 marks]
      For [1 mark] the answer is limited, with little evidence of understanding what an
      autocratic leadership style implies. For [2 marks] the answer is superficial; it may
      explain what an autocratic leadership style is, yet without commenting on the
      appropriateness for the Canadian subsidiary, or it may identify some generic
      advantages and disadvantages (i.e. what makes it effective and what makes
      it ineffective), yet without proper reference to the case study.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      For [3 marks] the answer is clear but it may lack balance or precision.
      For [4 marks] the effectiveness of Susan’s autocratic leadership style is presented
      in a balanced way: the answer explains what it means, and also covers both
      advantages and disadvantages (i.e. what makes it effective and what makes
      it ineffective).
                                            – 10 –           N10/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Analyse the appropriateness of a cost-based pricing strategy (line 29) for
      N-Pharma’s drugs.                                                          [7 marks]

      A cost-based pricing strategy simply means that the prices (of N-Pharma’s drugs)
      are partly/mainly based on the costs (to cover all the costs, both fixed and
      variable, from R&D to distribution). It is the simplest pricing method; it is a
      common model in the pharmaceutical industry (line 29) and in many other
      industries, such as the construction or retail industry. A “cost-plus” approach is
      often used:
      Price = cost of production + margin of profit

      A cost-based pricing strategy can be appropriate for N-Pharma’s drugs for the
      following reasons:
      • it is relatively easy to calculate
      • it can help ensure break-even, recovering all the previous costs, especially the
         long-term ones of R&D (see Appendix 1)
      • it can ensure a margin of profit (usually a percentage mark-up)
      • it has an ethical advantage: the so-called “just price”.

      However, it may also be inappropriate for two key reasons:
      • it takes no account of demand: there is no way of determining if potential
        customers will purchase the drugs at the calculated price, which is a problem as
        “in periods of economic difficulties, many people prefer to buy generic drugs,
        which are cheaper” (lines 53–54)
      • it takes no account of competitors’ prices (both branded and generic ones).

      Accept any other relevant substantiated analysis.

3.   (a)   Tadashi Agi has been appointed to the new post of “director of corporate
           social responsibility” (line 101). Outline two methods of recruitment that
           could have been used in this appointment.                                  [4 marks]

           Recruitment can be:
           • internal
           • external (which clearly was the case for Tadashi as he was working at the
             National University of Tsukuba).

           The four most common methods of external recruitment are:
           • job centres
           • job advertisements
           • recruitment agency
           • personal recommendation
           • accept any other relevant method of recruitment.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid method of recruitment identified up to a maximum
           of [2 marks], and [1 mark] for a correct brief explanation of each of these
           methods of recruitment up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Explain how Tadashi Agi could use new technologies within N-Pharma to
      communicate his ethical vision effectively with stakeholders (lines 105–106). [4 marks]

      To communicate his ethical vision with external stakeholders, Tadashi could keep
      a blog focusing on the (new) ethics of N-Pharma or he could commission and
      publish video clips. For internal stakeholders, an online corporate newsletter may
      be more appropriate, or regular updates on the company portal; this would help
      Tadashi “encourage ethical practices in all departments” (lines 104–105) as he
      could reach all staff and would thereby remind them of the new ethical objectives
      of N-Pharma.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      N.B. Candidates may refer to a range of Web 2.0 tools and may give precise
      examples – but the question is not just about imagining and describing what
      Tadashi could do. In order to score above [2 marks], candidates must explain
      how these technologies can be used (what they would enable Tadashi to do,
      which objectives he could reach).

      [1 to 2 marks]
      For [1 mark] the answer is limited, with little evidence of understanding of the
      use of new technologies to communicate with stakeholders. For [2 marks] the
      answer is superficial; it may comment on the importance or potential of new
      information technologies, yet without precise reference to the case study.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      For [3 marks] the answer is clear but it may lack depth or breadth (for example
      only writing about blogs). For [4 marks] the answer is clear and detailed,
      with explanations about the use of new technologies, with explicit references to
      some examples of technology and stakeholders.

(c)   Tadashi Agi is now writing a “Charter of Ethics”, setting ethical objectives
      for N-Pharma (lines 102–103). Examine the reasons why organizations
      consider setting ethical objectives.                                         [7 marks]

      Organizations may set ethical objectives because they are increasingly aware of
      their corporate social responsibility (CSR) or because they want to respond to the
      public demand for transparency and business ethics. It could also increase
      employee motivation and reduce negative publicity from pressure groups.
      However, this is sometimes regarded as a sudden knee-jerk reaction to scandals
      e.g. “experiments on animals” (line 90) (the appointment of Tadashi could be
      cynically interpreted that way) or as a way to pay lip-service to political agendas
      and to external pressure (from stakeholders such as campaigning organizations).
      Ultimately, one could argue that the exact motives themselves may not matter
      (is it a genuine interest in ethics?) as long as the objectives are set and achieved.

      Accept any other relevant substantiated examination.

                                             SECTION B

4.   (a)   Outline two alternative strategies that could have been used to deal with the
           liquidity problem at the USA subsidiary of N-Pharma (line 111).               [4 marks]

           The USA subsidiary could have used the following strategies to deal with the
           liquidity problem:
           • delaying purchases (or getting longer payment terms from vendors and
              suppliers)
           • considering long-term borrowing (including from N-Pharma’s headquarters or
              other external sources of capital) to repay short-term debt
           • reviewing credit policies with clients and customers (possibly adjusting them to
              minimize the time it takes to collect payment)
           • reviewing how assets are being used: they could have sold some unproductive
              assets (such as buildings, equipment and vehicles)
           • reviewing the profitability on some of the N-Pharma drugs on the USA market
              (e.g. they might have increased some prices to maintain or increase
              profitability)
           • accept any other valid suggestion.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid strategy identified up to a maximum of [2 marks],
           and [1 mark] for a correct brief explanation of each of these strategies up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Explain the importance of quality assurance and quality control (lines 26–27)
      for N-Pharma.                                                                 [4 marks]

      Candidates may refer to the following points in their answer:
      • N-Pharma operates in the pharmaceutical industry where drugs must be
        carefully tested (otherwise it could be dangerous, even life-threatening, for
        consumers)
      • quality assurance and quality control give N-Pharma its reputation: any
        problem with drugs safety could escalate and be very detrimental to the
        company’s image/brand (and even to its very existence)
      • quality control is also important (for N-Pharma as well as any other company)
        because it can help reduce costs
      • quality control is an old fashioned approach increasingly replaced by
        quality assurance to ensure that the whole organization focuses on quality
        production (as opposed to just one quality controller).

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Candidates are not asked for a precise number of points. They could write one
      long answer or cover a range of separate elements.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct element of the answer, and [1 mark] for the
      development/explanation of that element, if appropriate up to a maximum
      [4 marks].

(c)   “N-Pharma already sells some of its drugs in China, especially through
      business-to-business (B2B) operations with private clinics” (lines 137–138).
      Explain the benefits for N-Pharma of using B2B operations compared to
      business-to-customers (B2C).                                                 [4 marks]

      “Business-to-business” (B2B) means that N-Pharma does not directly distribute
      and commercialize its drugs into the Chinese market, but through private clinics.
      This means fewer resources spent on direct promotion, but more promotional
      activities with the private clinics. The disadvantage is that N-Pharma is
      dependent on its relationship with the clinics (as intermediaries and brokers):
      should this relationship break down (for a range of reasons e.g. the clinics change
      supplier), N-Pharma would lose its main channel of distribution in China. On the
      other hand, “business-to-customers” (B2C) requires more resources spent on
      promotion (advertising, developing brand recognition, convincing consumers to
      switch from their usual drugs, creating brand loyalty etc.) – but N-Pharma would
      have a more stable customer base.


      [1 mark]
      The answer shows some confused or limited understanding of the differences
      between B2B and B2C.

      [2 to 3 marks]
      The two concepts are understood and described, but the explanation or the
      application to the case study (N-Pharma in China) remains limited. For [3 marks]
      there is reference to the case study but the explanation is partial.

      [4 marks]
      The two concepts are well presented and the benefits for N-Pharma of using
      B2B operations compared to B2C is clearly explained, with references to the
      case study.

(d)   N-Pharma subsidiaries have a double role: they “are responsible for both
      production and distribution of N-Pharma drugs in their national markets”
      (lines 18–19). Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such a double
      role.                                                                    [8 marks]

      Advantages include:
      • there is no need to import drugs produced abroad, which cuts costs and may
        represent a competitive advantage for N-Pharma’s branded drugs
      • some consumers may prefer to buy drugs produced in their own country
        (this could be for political reasons, for example to support national economies,
        or because they feel safer about the quality control systems in place)
      • managerial economies of scale can be achieved (and all the operations may be
        in one location, which is beneficial for the organizational structure and for the
        supply chain)
      • knowledge of the national markets is important for marketing and distribution
        (because of the cultural differences between Vietnam, USA and Chile for
        example)
      • accept any other relevant advantage.

      Disadvantages include:
      • economies of scale for the manufacturing of drugs cannot be achieved
        (the same drugs are produced in all the countries where N-Pharma has
        subsidiaries)
      • if one area/department of the subsidiary suffers (as in Canada or Australia),
        the entire subsidiary may be financially affected
      • subsidiaries may end up working in isolation from one another, which is not
        good for R&D as it may lead to duplication of efforts and waste of time
      • the Japanese headquarters at Tsukuba may only become aware of problems
        when it is too late (as with the USA subsidiary)
      • accept any other relevant disadvantage.


      The candidate’s answer should be a balanced substantiated discussion that is
      supported by evidence from the case study.

      Candidates may come to a conclusion/judgment for the top markband that the
      advantages outweigh the disadvantages or vice versa.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
