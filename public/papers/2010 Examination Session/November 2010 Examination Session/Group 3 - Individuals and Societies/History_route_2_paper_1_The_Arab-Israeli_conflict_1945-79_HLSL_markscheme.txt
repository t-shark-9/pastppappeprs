candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What does Source A suggest about Nasser’s attitude towards the
           Palestinian question?                                          [3 marks]

            Nasser sees the key issue as being the rights of the Palestinian people;
            Nasser sees the 1948 war and its consequences as being the centre of the Palestinian
             question;
            Nasser also indicates that if the US and Britain support Israel against Egypt on the
             issue of Palestine then they will all become Egypt’s enemy.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                     [2 marks]

            That the four Arab nations are united in their tactics and are militarily strong;
            That Israel (identified by the Star of David) is too weak to oppose the Arab forces.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and E about the
     1967 crisis.                                                                         [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources agree that there were indications that Egypt and the Arab forces were not
       intending to immediately invade Israel;
      Both sources show that the US was directly involved in the crisis diplomatically;
      Both sources agree that the Israeli cabinet authorised the attack.
      Both sources show that Israel felt she had already been invaded.

     For “contrast”
      Source C clearly blames Dayan for insisting upon military action;
      Source E also shows that Israel was determined to deny Nasser his political triumph in the
       Arab world;
      Source C raises the issue of Russian intervention.


     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source D for historians studying the Arab–Israeli Six Day
     War (1967).                                                                             [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:      It is an extract from a speech by the Egyptian President Nasser in May 1957.

     Purpose:     It is intended to indicate what the Egyptian position is in regard to the
                  Palestinian question. It is also intended to make a statement about the actions of
                  Israel and to warn Britain and the US that they need to be impartial in their
                  dealings with the Middle East.

     Value:       It shows the Egyptian stance on the Palestinian question in 1967 and is a clear
                  statement of policy. It is contemporary.

     Limitations: Although it states the Palestinian position, it is clearly subjective both in its tone
                  and its content. It is an Egyptian view of events since 1948 and is intended to
                  garner support from the other Arab states.

     Source D
     Origin:      It is an extract from the book The Palestine–Israel Conflict, written by Gregory
                  Harms in 2005.

     Purpose:     It is an account of the Palestine–Israel conflict and is intended to inform and
                  educate its readers about the situation in the Middle East.

     Value:       It is written in 2005 and is therefore up-to-date and has the benefit of hindsight
                  having access to many sources.

     Limitations: It is written by a Western freelance writer and researcher who may not read or
                  speak Arabic or Hebrew. The writer is not an academic historian and there is no
                  information given about his professional background, which may make his
                  account less objective.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material. Ideally there will be a
     balance between the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a
     [4/2 mark] split. If only one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of
     [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the reasons behind the
     outbreak of the Arab–Israeli Six Day War (1967).                                    [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A: This source indicates that Egypt has the right to deal with the Palestine question
               and places the 1967 crisis firmly in the context of its historical background.
               It blames Israeli aggression in the 1948 war and intimates that Israel will be to
               blame if a war breaks out. It also indicates that it appeared as if Johnson and the
               US would support military action.

     Source B: This source shows that the Arab nations are militaristic and are ready to attack
               Israel.

     Source C: This source explicitly states that the Israeli General Dayan favoured military
               action on a battleground close to the Israeli border, that Egypt was not ready for a
               full offensive and that Israel’s Prime Minister Eban also wanted war.

     Source D: This source places the blame on Nasser for asking the United Nations Emergency
               Force (UNEF) to withdraw and, believing that the Israelis were massing troops,
               Nasser moved the Egyptian army into the Sinai Peninsula. He was also interested
               in “polishing up his image”.

     Source E: This source blames Israel for the attack as it shows that Nasser was attempting to
               defuse the situation by sending Mohieddine to Washington. It also states that
               while Egyptian occupation of Sharm-al-Sheikh might justify attack, the real
               reason was to deny Nasser a political triumph in the Arab world

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge may include: the background to the conflict including the consequences of
     the 1956 Suez Crisis; the formation of the PLO in 1964 could also be included, as could the
     policies of Britain and the US; U Thant’s position in the UN and his reaction to Nasser’s
     request for a partial withdrawal of the UNEF is a key issue, as is the internal struggle within
     the Israeli cabinet over the attack. Israel declared that the attack was pre-emptive as Egypt
     was about to attack Israel, but there is some dispute about this claim.

     Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or only
     own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
