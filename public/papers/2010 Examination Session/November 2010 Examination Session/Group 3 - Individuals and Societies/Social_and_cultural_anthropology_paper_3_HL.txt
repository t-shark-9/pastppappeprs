      • gender.


3.    Examine two theoretical schools in relation to cohesion and conflict.


4.    Compare and contrast synchronic and diachronic perspectives in ethnography.


5.    Compare and contrast two theoretical schools in terms of one of the following perspectives:

      • particularistic
