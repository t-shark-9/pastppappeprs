Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

      (a)   A hospital specializes in treating overweight patients. These patients have
            weights that are independently, normally distributed with mean 200 kg and
            standard deviation 15 kg. The elevator in the hospital will break if the total
            weight of people inside it exceeds 1150 kg. Six patients enter the elevator.
            Find the probability that the elevator breaks.                                       [7 marks]

      (b)   A factory makes life size wax copies of famous people. These famous people
            have weights that are independently, normally distributed with mean 80 kg and
            standard deviation 10 kg. The life size copies all have exactly the same weight
            as the famous person they represent. Twelve copies of one particular famous
            person are placed in the elevator in the factory. This elevator will also break
            if the total weight of the copies exceeds 1150 kg. Find the probability that the
            elevator breaks.                                                                     [7 marks]

      The length of time, T , in months, that a football manager stays in his job before he
      is removed can be approximately modelled by a normal distribution with population
      mean µ and population variance σ 2 . An independent sample of five values of T is
      given below.

                                     6.5 , 12.4 , 18.2 , 3.7 , 5.4

      (a)   Given that σ 2 = 9 ,

		          (i)    use the above sample to find the 95 % confidence interval for µ ,
                   giving the bounds of the interval to two decimal places;

		          (ii)   find the smallest number of values of T that would be required in a sample
                   for the total width of the 90 % confidence interval for µ to be less than
                   2 months.                                                                    [10 marks]

      (b)   If the value of σ 2 is unknown, use the above sample to find the 95 % confidence
            interval for µ , giving the bounds of the interval to two decimal places.            [5 marks]

      As soon as Sarah misses a total of 4 lessons at her school an email is sent to
      her parents. The probability that she misses any particular lesson is constant with a
               1
      value of . Her decision to attend a lesson is independent of her previous decisions.

      A teacher has forgotten his computer password. He knows that it is either six of the
      letter J followed by two of the letter R (i.e. JJJJJJRR) or three of the letter J followed
      by four of the letter R (i.e. JJJRRRR). The computer is able to tell him at random just
      two of the letters in his password.

      The teacher decides to use the following rule to attempt to find his password.

      If the computer gives him a J and a J, he will accept the null hypothesis that his
      password is JJJJJJRR.

      Otherwise he will accept the alternative hypothesis that his password is JJJRRRR.
