                                        Instructions to Examiners

Notes:     If in doubt about these instructions or any other marking issues, contact your team leader for
           clarification.

           The number of marks for each question is 6.

           Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers must be given exactly or
           correct to three significant figures.

1    Abbreviations

     The markscheme may make use of the following abbreviations:

     M     Marks awarded for Method

     A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy

     C     Marks awarded for Correct answers (irrespective of working shown)

     R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning

     ft    Marks that can be awarded as follow through from previous results in the question

2    Method of Marking

     (a)   All marking must be done in scoris using the mathematical studies annotations and in accordance
           with the document ‘Guidance for e-marking Mathematical Studies SL 2010’.

     (b)   Marks must be noted on candidates’ scripts as in the markscheme. A correct answer only needs C
           marks to be shown, otherwise show the breakdown of individual marks using the abbreviations
           (M1), (A2) etc.

     (c)   In this paper, the maximum mark is awarded for a correct answer on the answer line. There is
           no need to check the working! Award C marks and move on.

     (d)   If the answer does not appear on the answer line, but the correct answer is seen in the working box
           with no subsequent working, award the maximum mark.

     (e)   If the answer is wrong, marks should be awarded for the working according to the markscheme.

     (f)   Working crossed out by the candidate should not be awarded any marks.

     (g)   A correct answer in the working box transcribed inaccurately to the answer line can receive full
           marks.

     (h)   If correct working results in a correct answer in the working box but then further working is
           developed, full marks should not be awarded. In most such cases it will be a single final answer
           mark that is lost, however, a statement on the answer line should always be taken as the candidate’s
           final decision on the answer as long as it is unambiguous.

Please note: Assignment of marks to the answers in all the following examples is for demonstration
purposes only. Marks for actual examination questions will not necessarily follow the same pattern.

3   Follow through (ft) Marks

    Errors made at any step of a solution can affect all working that follows. To limit the severity of the
    penalty, follow through (ft) marks can be awarded. Markschemes will indicate where it is appropriate to
    apply follow through in a question with ‘(ft)’ appended to the eligible mark(s).

     If an answer resulting from follow through is extremely unrealistic (e.g. negative distances or wrong
      by large order of magnitude) then the final A mark should not be awarded. If in doubt, contact your
      team leader.

     If a question is transformed by an error into a different, much simpler question then follow through
      might not apply or might be reduced. In this situation consult your team leader and record the
      decision on the candidate’s script.

     To award follow through marks for a question part, there must be working present for that part and
      not just an answer based on the follow through. An isolated follow through answer, with no working,
      must be regarded as incorrect and receives no marks even if it seems approximately correct.

     Inadvertent use of radians will be penalised the first time it occurs. Subsequent use, even in later
      questions, will normally be allowed follow through marks, unless the answer is unrealistic. Cases of
      this kind will be addressed on an individual basis.

 Implementation: The following examples illustrate correct use of the follow through process in
 straightforward situations.

4    Using the Markscheme

     This markscheme presents a particular way in which each question might be worked and how it should be
     marked.

     (a)    As A marks are normally dependent on the preceding M mark being awarded, it is not possible to
            award (M0)(A1). Once an (M0) has been awarded, all subsequent A marks are lost in that part of
            the question, even if calculations are performed correctly, until the next M mark, unless otherwise
            instructed in the markscheme. (See the first example above). Similarly (A1)(R0) cannot be
            awarded for an answer which is accidentally correct for the wrong reasons given.

     Implementation: Question: (a)  2 calculated followed by (b) degrees of freedom found and (c) and (d)
     comparison to critical value. (Interdependence of A and R marks.)

(b)   Alternative methods have not always been included. Thus, if an answer is wrong then the
      working must be carefully analysed in order that marks are awarded for a different method in a
      manner that is consistent with the markscheme.
      Where alternative methods for complete questions are included in the markscheme, they are
      indicated by ‘OR’ etc. This includes alternatives obtained with a graphic display calculator.

5   Accuracy of Answers

    Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers must be given exactly or correct to 3
    significant figures.
    A penalty known as an ACCURACY PENALTY (AP) is applied if an answer is either
    (i)    rounded incorrectly to 3 significant figures or
    (ii)   rounded correctly or incorrectly to some other level of accuracy.
    This penalty is applied to the final answer of a question part only. It applies also when an exact answer
    is incorrectly rounded.

    THE ACCURACY PENALTY IS APPLIED AT MOST ONCE PER PAPER! Subsequent accuracy
    errors can be ignored and full marks awarded if all else is correct. Please see section G in the guidance
    document which clearly explains, with the use of screenshots how this works in scoris.

    An accuracy penalty must be recorded in proximity to the incorrect answer as (A1)(AP). This is different
    to what we have done previously awarding (A0)(AP). This mark is not deducted in the item box but from
    the final whole paper total automatically by scoris.

    If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
    the required accuracy. In all such cases the final mark is not awarded if the rounding does not follow
    the instructions given in the question. This is NOT an accuracy penalty. A mark for specified accuracy
    can be regarded as a (ft) mark regardless of an immediately preceding (M0).

    Rounding of an exact answer to 3 significant figures should be accepted if performed correctly. If the
                                                                                                                1
    rounding is incorrect, an accuracy penalty should be applied as detailed above. Exact answers such as
                                                                                                                4
    can be written as decimals to less than three significant figures if the result is still exact. Reduction of a
    fraction to its lowest terms is not essential.

    Ratios of π and answers taking the form of square roots of integers (even if exact squares) or any
                                              2
    rational power of an integer (e.g. 13, 2 3 , 4 5 , 9 ) may be accepted as exact answers. All other powers
    (e.g. of non-integers) and values of transcendental functions such as sine and cosine must be evaluated.
    Answers with no supporting working (usually from a GDC), which are written correct to more than
    3 significant figures can be awarded full marks with an (AP) then applied. When this happens, multiple C
    marks can be split e.g. (A1)(A1)(AP).

    If there is no working shown, and answers are given to the correct two significant figures, apply the (AP).
    However, do not accept answers to one significant figure without working.

    An accuracy penalty should not be applied to an answer that is already incorrect for some other
    reason.

Special cases

An answer taken directly from the IB chi squared statistical table can be given and used to the same level
of accuracy as appears in the table (3 decimal places) or correct to 3 significant figures.

For judging equivalence between 3 significant figures and use of minutes and seconds for angles,
guidelines have been issued to paper setters. This problem will be dealt with on an individual basis as the
need arises.

Premature Rounding

Accuracy errors in a final answer, which result from premature rounding earlier in the same question part,
should not receive an accuracy penalty. There are two situations.
If there is a mark available for a prematurely rounded answer and the rounding occurs at this stage, then
the inappropriate rounding should be penalised with (A0) but the answer can then be allowed to follow
through to the end of the question. If the first stage of the answer is correct but rounded further on, then it
should be penalised at an appropriate place close to where it is rounded. Some discretion should be used
to deny a (ft) mark if the rounding is very bad and the answer far from its required value.

6   Level of accuracy in finance questions

    The accuracy level required for answers will be specified in all questions involving money. This will
    usually be either whole units or two decimal places, but could differ in rare instances depending on the
    currency in question.

    A penalty known as a FINANCIAL ACCURACY PENALTY (FP) is applied if an answer does not
    adhere to the specification in the question. This penalty is applied to the final answer of a question part
    only. Please see section G in the guidance document which clearly explains, with the use of screenshots
    how this works in scoris.


    THE FINANCIAL ACCURACY PENALTY IS APPLIED AT MOST ONCE PER PAPER! Subsequent
    financial accuracy errors can be ignored and full marks awarded, if all else is correct.

A financial accuracy penalty must be recorded in proximity to the incorrect answer as (A1)(FP). This is
different to what we have done previously awarding (A0)(FP). This mark is not deducted in the item
box but from the final whole paper total automatically by scoris.

The financial accuracy penalty is imposed only for rounding to the wrong level of accuracy and NOT for
incorrect rounding to the required number of places. The latter would incur a normal accuracy penalty
(AP).
No single answer can receive two penalties. If both types of error are present then (FP) takes
priority.

Please see the examples below.

NOTE: The financial accuracy penalty will be flagged in the markscheme at the start of each answer
where it could apply, with the words “Financial accuracy penalty (FP) applies in parts (a)…”. If this
instruction is not present, then do not apply the penalty. An (FP) will also be present in the left hand
column next to where it applies.

Example: A financial question demands accuracy correct to 2dp.
               Prior to rounding the answer is $231.6189

7   Units in answers

    A penalty known as a UNIT PENALTY (UP) is applied if an answer does not include the correct units.
    This applies both to missing units and to incorrect units. This penalty is applied to the final answer of a
    question part only. Please see section G in the guidance document which clearly explains, with the use of
    screenshots how this works in scoris.

    THE UNIT PENALTY IS APPLIED AT MOST ONCE PER PAPER! Subsequent unit errors can be
    ignored and full marks awarded if all else is correct.

    A unit penalty must be recorded in proximity to the incorrect answer as (A1)(UP). This is different to
    what we have done previously awarding (A0)(UP). This mark is not deducted in the item box but from
    the final whole paper total automatically by scoris.

    NOTE: The unit penalty will be flagged in the markscheme at the start of each answer where it could apply,
    with the words “Unit penalty (UP) applies in parts (a)…”. If this instruction is not present, then do not apply
    the penalty. A (UP) will also be present in the left hand column next to where it applies.

    NOTE: In this context, symbols for currency such as $ or GBP etc are not considered units. Candidates
    are encouraged to include them but should not be penalised if they are missing.
    Missing degree symbols and percentage symbols are also not eligible for a unit penalty.

    No single answer can receive two penalties. If an answer is rounded incorrectly and also has wrong
    or missing units, apply the accuracy penalty (AP) only. If the (AP) has already been used, such an
    answer is eligible for the unit penalty.

    Example: A question has answer to part (i) of 66.2 cm. The answer before rounding is 66.213 cm.
    Part (ii) involves dividing by 60 with units of cms-1. Assume that the (UP) has not been used previously.
