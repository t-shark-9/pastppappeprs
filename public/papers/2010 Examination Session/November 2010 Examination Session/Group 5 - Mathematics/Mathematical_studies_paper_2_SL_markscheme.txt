                                        Instructions to Examiners

Notes:     If in doubt about these instructions or any other marking issues, contact your team leader for
           clarification.

           Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers must be given exactly or
           correct to three significant figures.

1    Abbreviations

     The markscheme may make use of the following abbreviations:

     M     Marks awarded for Method

     A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy

     G     Marks awarded for correct solutions obtained from a Graphic Display Calculator, irrespective of
           working shown.

     R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning

     AG    Answer Given in the question and consequently, marks not awarded.

     ft    Marks that can be awarded as follow through from previous results in the question

           In paper 2 candidates are expected to demonstrate their ability to communicate mathematics using
           appropriate working. Answers which are correct but not supported by adequate working will not
           always receive full marks. Marks to be awarded for unsupported answers are designated G in the
           mark scheme as such answers will usually arise from working performed on a graphic display
           calculator.

2    Method of Marking

     (a)   All marking must be done in scoris using the mathematical studies annotations and in accordance
           with the document ‘Guidance for e-marking Mathematical Studies SL 2010’.

     (b)   Marks must be noted on candidates’ scripts as in the markscheme and show the breakdown of
           individual marks using the abbreviations (M1), (A2) etc;

     (c)   Working crossed out by the candidate should not be awarded any marks.

     (d)   Where candidates have written two solutions to a question, only the first solution should be
           marked.

     (e)   If correct working results in a correct answer but then further working is developed, full marks are
           not always awarded. In most such cases it will be a single final answer mark that is lost. Full
           marks can be awarded if the candidate demonstrates clear understanding of the task and the result.
           If in doubt, consult your team leader.

     (f)   Candidate drawn graphs will have a single (A1) available for scales and labels combined. This can
           be awarded if all these are present and correct, even if no graph is drawn, however, the mark should
           not be awarded if the scale shown is inappropriate to, or inadequate for, the required missing graph.
           In papers which have two candidate drawn graphs, consistent errors in showing labels or scales can
           follow through on the second graph, though not if the error is complete omission of these features.

Please note: Assignment of marks to the answers in all the following examples is for demonstration
purposes only. Marks for actual examination questions will not necessarily follow the same pattern.

3   Follow-through (ft) Marks

    Errors made at any step of a solution can affect all working that follows. To limit the severity of the
    penalty, follow through (ft) marks can be awarded. Markschemes will indicate where it is appropriate to
    apply follow through in a question with ‘(ft)’ appended to the eligible mark(s).

         If an answer resulting from follow through is extremely unrealistic (e.g. negative distances or wrong
          by a large order of magnitude) then the final A mark should not be awarded. If in doubt, contact your
          team leader.

         If a question is transformed by an error into a different, much simpler question then follow through
          might not apply or might be reduced. In this situation consult your team leader and record the
          decision on the candidate’s script.

         To award follow through marks for a question part, there must be working present for that part
          and not just an answer based on the follow through. An isolated follow through answer, with no
          working, must be regarded as incorrect and receives no marks even if it seems approximately
          correct.

         Inadvertent use of radians will be penalised the first time it occurs. Subsequent use, even in later
          questions will normally be allowed follow through marks unless the answer is unrealistic. Cases of
          this kind will be addressed on an individual basis.

Implementation: The following examples illustrate correct use of the follow through process in
straightforward situations.

4    Using the Markscheme

     This markscheme presents a particular way in which each question might be worked and how it should be
     marked.

     (a)       As A marks are normally dependent on the preceding M mark being awarded, it is not possible
               to award (M0)(A1). Once an (M0) has been awarded, all subsequent A marks are lost in that part
               of the question, even if calculations are performed correctly, until the next M mark, unless
               otherwise instructed in the markscheme. (See the finance example above).

               Similarly (A1)(R0) cannot be awarded for an answer which is accidentally correct for the wrong
               reasons given.

     Example: Question: (a)  2 calculated followed by (b) degrees of freedom found and (c) and (d)
     comparison to critical value. (Dependence of A and R marks.)

(b)      Alternative methods have not always been included. Thus, if an answer is wrong then the
         working must be carefully analysed in order that marks are awarded for a different method in a
         manner that is consistent with the markscheme.

         Where alternative methods for complete questions are included in the markscheme, they are
         indicated by ‘OR’ etc. This includes alternatives obtained with a graphic display calculator. In
         such cases, alternative G mark assignments for answer only will not be repeated if this is
         redundant.

         On the markscheme, these equivalent numerical or algebraic forms will sometimes be written in
         brackets after the required answer.

(d)      As this is an international examination, all valid alternative forms of notation should be accepted.

         Some examples of these are:

         Decimal points: 1.7; 1’7; 1  7 ; 1,7.

         Different descriptions of an interval: 3 < x < 5; (3, 5); ] 3, 5 [ .

         Different forms of notation for set properties (e.g. complement): A ; A ; Ac ; U  A ; (A

         Different forms of logic notation:        p ; p ; 
                                                             p ; p ; ~ p.
                                                   pq; pq; q p.

(e)     Discretionary (d) marks: There will be rare occasions where the markscheme does not cover the
        work seen. In such cases, (d) should be used to indicate where an examiner has used discretion. It
        must be accompanied by a brief note to explain the decision made.

5   Accuracy of Answers

    Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers must be given exactly or correct to 3
    significant figures.

    A penalty known as an ACCURACY PENALTY (AP) is applied if an answer is either
    (i)    rounded incorrectly to 3 significant figures or
    (ii)   rounded correctly or incorrectly to some other level of accuracy.
    This penalty is applied to the final answer of a question part only. It applies also when an exact answer
    is incorrectly rounded.

    THE ACCURACY PENALTY IS APPLIED AT MOST ONCE PER PAPER! Subsequent accuracy
    errors can be ignored and full marks awarded if all else is correct. Please see section G in the guidance
    document which clearly explains, with the use of screenshots how this works in scoris.

    An accuracy penalty must be recorded in proximity to the incorrect answer as (A1)(AP). This is different
    to what we have done previously awarding A0AP. This mark is not deducted in the item box but from
    the final whole paper total automatically in scoris.

    If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
    the required accuracy. In all such cases the final mark is not awarded if the rounding does not follow
    the instructions given in the question. This is NOT an accuracy penalty. A mark for specified accuracy
    can be regarded as a (ft) mark regardless of an immediately preceding (M0).

    Rounding of an exact answer to 3 significant figures should be accepted if performed correctly. If the
    rounding is incorrect, an accuracy penalty should be applied as detailed above. Exact answers such as
     1
       can be written as decimals to less than three significant figures if the result is still exact. Reduction of a
     4
    fraction to its lowest terms is not essential.

    Ratios of π and answers taking the form of square roots of integers (even if exact squares) or any
                                               2
    rational power of an integer (e.g. 13, 2 3 , 4 5 , 9 ) may be accepted as exact answers. All other powers
    (e.g. of non-integers) and values of transcendental functions such as sine and cosine must be evaluated.

    Answers with no supporting working which are written correct to more than 3 significant figures should
    be marked according to the scheme for correct answers with no working, but with an (AP) then applied.
    When this happens, (A2) or (G2) can be split if necessary (e.g. (A1)(A1)(AP) or (G1)(G1)(AP)). If there
    is no working shown, and answers are given to the correct two significant figures, apply the (AP).
    However, do not accept answers to one significant figure without working.

    An accuracy penalty should not be applied to an answer that is already incorrect for some other reason.

    Special cases

    An answer taken directly from the IB chi-squared statistical table can be given and used to the same level
    of accuracy as appears in the table (3 decimal places) or correct to 3 significant figures.

    For judging equivalence between 3 significant figures and use of minutes and seconds for angles,
    guidelines have been issued to paper setters. This problem will be dealt with on an individual basis as the
    need arises.

Premature Rounding

Accuracy errors in a final answer, which result from premature rounding earlier in the same question part,
should not receive an accuracy penalty. There are two situations. If there is a mark available for a
prematurely rounded answer and the rounding occurs at this stage, then the inappropriate rounding should
be penalised with (A0) but the answer can then be allowed to follow through to the end of the question. If
the first stage of the answer is correct but rounded further on, then it should be penalised at an appropriate
place close to where it is rounded. Some discretion should be used to deny a (ft) mark if the rounding is
very bad and the answer far from its required value.

Example: Question: sine rule used to find angle A, with angle B and side b known but side a is first
calculated using Pythagoras in an adjoining triangle.

6   Level of accuracy in finance questions

    The accuracy level required for answers will be specified in all questions involving money. This will
    usually be either whole units or two decimal places, but could differ in rare instances depending on the
    currency in question.

    A penalty known as a FINANCIAL ACCURACY PENALTY (FP) is applied if an answer does not
    adhere to the specification in the question. This penalty is applied to the final answer of a question part
    only. Please see section G in the guidance document which clearly explains, with the use of screenshots
    how this works in scoris.

    THE FINANCIAL ACCURACY PENALTY IS APPLIED AT MOST ONCE PER PAPER!
    Subsequent financial accuracy errors can be ignored and full marks awarded, if all else is correct.

    A financial accuracy penalty must be recorded in proximity to the incorrect answer as (A1)(FP). This is
    different to what we have done previously awarding (A0)(FP). This mark is not deducted in the item
    box but from the final whole paper total automatically by scoris.

    The financial accuracy penalty is imposed only for rounding to the wrong level of accuracy and NOT for
    incorrect rounding to the required number of places. The latter would incur a normal accuracy penalty
    (AP).
    No single answer can receive two penalties. If both types of error are present then (FP) takes
    priority.

    Please see the examples below.

    NOTE: The financial accuracy penalty will be flagged in the markscheme at the start of each answer
    where it could apply, with the words “Financial accuracy penalty (FP) applies in part (a)…”. If this
    instruction is not present, then do not apply the penalty. An (FP) will also be present in the left hand
    column next to where it applies.

7   Units in answers

    A penalty known as a UNIT PENALTY (UP) is applied if an answer does not include the correct units.
    This applies both to missing units and to incorrect units. This penalty is applied to the final answer of a
    question part only.

    THE UNIT PENALTY IS APPLIED AT MOST ONCE PER PAPER! Subsequent unit errors can be
    ignored and full marks awarded if all else is correct. Please see section G in the guidance document which
    clearly explains, with the use of screenshots how this works in scoris.

    THE UNIT PENALTY IS APPLIED AT MOST ONCE PER PAPER! Subsequent unit errors can be
    ignored and full marks awarded if all else is correct.

    A unit penalty must be recorded in proximity to the incorrect answer as (A1)(UP). This is different to
    what we have done previously awarding (A0)(UP). This mark is not deducted in the item box but from
    the final whole paper total automatically in scoris.

    NOTE: The unit penalty will be flagged in the markscheme at the start of each answer where it could
    apply, with the words “Unit penalty (UP) applies in parts (a)…”. If this instruction is not present, then do
    not apply the penalty. A (UP) will also be present in the left hand column next to where it applies.

    NOTE: In this context, symbols for currency such as $ or GBP etc are not considered units. Candidates
    are encouraged to include them but should not be penalised if they are missing.
    Missing degree symbols and percentage symbols are also not eligible for a unit penalty.

    No single answer can receive two penalties. If an answer is rounded incorrectly and also has wrong
    or missing units, apply the accuracy penalty (AP) only. If the (AP) has already been used, such an
    answer is eligible for the unit penalty.

    Example: A question has answer to part (i) of 66.2 cm. The answer before rounding is 66.213 cm.
    Part (ii) involves dividing by 60 with units of cms-1. Assume that the (UP) has not been used previously.
