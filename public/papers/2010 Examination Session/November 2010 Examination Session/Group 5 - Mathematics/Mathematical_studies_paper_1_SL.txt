Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is wrong, some marks may be given
for correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Working may be continued below the box,
if necessary. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

1.    Consider the following four numbers.

                                                                 π

      (a)   One of these numbers is written in the form a × 10k where 1 ≤ a < 10
            and k ∈  . Write down this number.                                                [1 mark]

3.    In a television show there is a transparent box completely filled with identical cubes.
      Participants have to estimate the number of cubes in the box. The box is 50 cm
      wide, 100 cm long and 40 cm tall.

      (a)   Find the volume of the box.                                                         [2 marks]

      Joaquin estimates the volume of one cube to be 500 cm3 . He uses this value to
      estimate the number of cubes in the box.

      (b)   Find Joaquin’s estimated number of cubes in the box.                                [2 marks]

      The actual number of cubes in the box is 350 .

      (c)   Find the percentage error in Joaquin’s estimated number of cubes in the box.        [2 marks]
