      (b)     State one computer application for which a queue is a suitable data structure.       [1 mark]

      Consider the following class.

      class Node
      {
        public int item;
        public Node next;

            public Node(int d)
            {
              item = d;
              next = null;
            }

            public void displayNode()
            {
              output(item + " ");
            }
      }

      (c)     Statement  Node x = new Node(5); creates an object of class type  Node.  
              State the output produced by the call  x.displayNode(); .                            [1 mark]

(Question 1 continued)

      Examine the following linked list implementation of a queue.
      class MyQueue
      { private Node first;
        private Node last;
        public MyQueue() { first = null; last = null; }
        public boolean isEmpty() { return first == null; }
            public void enqueue(int x)
            { Node newNode = new Node(x);
              if (isEmpty())
              { first = newNode; }
              else
              { last.next = newNode; }
              last = newNode;
            }
            public int dequeue()
            {
              // Code missing that will remove a node from the queue
            }
            public void displayQueue()
            { if (first == null)
              { output("The queue is empty!"); }
              else
              { Node temp = first;
                 while (temp != null)
                 { temp.displayNode();
                   temp = temp.next;
                 }
              }
            }
      }

      (d)     The statement  MyQueue x = new MyQueue(); creates an empty queue.

              (i)    State the output that will be produced after execution of the following statement.
                                                  x.displayQueue();                                        [1 mark]

              (ii)   Construct the code for the method  dequeue().  The method should remove
                     one item from  x and return the value of the removed item.              [4 marks]

              (iii) State the output that will be produced after execution of the following statements.
                                       x.enqueue(2);
                                       x.enqueue(4);
                                       int y = x.dequeue();
                                       output("Deleted item: " + y);
                                       x.enqueue(1);
                                       x.enqueue(7);
                                       output("Items in the queue: ");
                                       x.displayQueue();                                                  [3 marks]

2.    A car company sells five different models of cars and employs four salesmen.  
      A record of sales for each month can be represented by a table.  The first row of the
      table contains the number of sales of each model by Salesman 1; the second row
      contains the number of sales of each model by Salesman 2, and so on.

                           Model 1      Model 2      Model 3          Model 4    Model 5

      (a)    (i)    Calculate the total number of sales for Salesman 2.                              [1 mark]

             (ii)   Calculate the total number of sales of Model 3.                                  [1 mark]

      The sales data as given above is input into a two-dimensional array named Sales,
      declared as  int[][] Sales = new int[4][5]; that can be logically represented
      as follows.

                         Sales          [0] [1] [2] [3] [4]
                                  [0]   12    0      0     5      6

      Examine the following code.

      public void mystery(int[][] Sales)
      {
        for (int n = 0; n < 4; n = n + 1)
        {
           int total = 0;
           for (int m = 0; m < 5; m = m + 1)
           {
             total = total + Sales[n][m];
           }
           output("Total number of sales for Salesman " + (n + 1) + " is " + total);
        }
      }

      (b)    State the output of the method call  mystery(Sales).                                   [4 marks]




                                                               (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      (c)   Construct the method that will output the total number of sales for each of the
            five car models.                                                                  [6 marks]

      Assume that the prices of cars are given in the following one-dimensional array.

      double[] ModelPrice = {10288.00, 12999.99, 18456.00, 20345.00, 45799.00}

      For example:
      ModelPrice[1] holds value  12999.99.
      This means that the price of Model 2 is 12999.99.

      (d)   Construct a method that will accept a one-dimensional array  ModelPrice and
            a two-dimensional array  Sales.  The method should determine the best salesman
            (the one with the highest total number of sales); and it should output the best
            salesman and the highest total number of sales.  Assume there will not be a tie
            for best salesman.                                                                [8 marks]




8810-7012                                                                                     Turn over

3.    (a)   (i)    Define the term  file.                                                          [2 marks]

            (ii)   Identify two reasons why it is convenient to use files in applications which
                   involve large data sets.                                                        [2 marks]

      (b)   A file usually consists of a number of  records.  Each record is made up of  fields.

            (i)    Define the term  key field.                                                     [2 marks]

            (ii)   With reference to a  fully-indexed file, explain the difference between
                   logical file organization and  physical file organization.                      [4 marks]

      (c)   A small shop uses a computer to keep a daily check on its stock levels.  
            Information regarding the sale of goods is recorded in a  sequential transaction
            file named  UpdateFile.

            At the end of the day the master file,  StockFile, is updated with
            information from the transaction file,  UpdateFile, and stored in a new
            master file,  NewStockFile.  Each file is sorted so the item number field is in
            ascending order.

            For example, if the contents of  StockFile and  UpdateFile before an
            update are:

            StockFile                                                    UpdateFile
             item no. description quantity …other fields…                 item no. quantity
               1100 Choc/white      52                                      1100     14

               1206 Green tea       23


            Then, after updating, the contents of the new master file named  NewStockFile
            will be:

                          NewStockFile
                           item no. description quantity …other fields…
                             1100 Choc/white       38
                             1200 Herb tea         35
                             1206 Green tea        19


            (i)    Outline why the files,  StockFile and  UpdateFile, should be sorted in
                   the same order.                                                                 [2 marks]

            (ii)   Outline the algorithm to update records in  StockFile with information
                   from  UpdateFile to create  NewStockFile.                                       [8 marks]
