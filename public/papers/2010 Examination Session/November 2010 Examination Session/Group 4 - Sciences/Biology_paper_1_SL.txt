      What statement can be made from the data?

      A.    The increase in the biomass of the worm is due to an increase in the percentage of organic
            nitrogen.

      B.    There is no relationship between the biomass of the worm and the percentage of organic
            nitrogen.

      C.    The increase in the percentage of organic nitrogen is due to an increase in the biomass of
            the worm.

      D.    As the biomass of the worm increases so does the percentage of organic nitrogen.
