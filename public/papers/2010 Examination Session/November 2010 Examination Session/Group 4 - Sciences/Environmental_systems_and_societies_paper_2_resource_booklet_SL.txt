Figure 2    Background information on the Plains bison


   The Plains bison (Bison bison bison) is a bovine (cow-like) mammal. Massive herds of these
   bison once inhabited the Great Plains (temperate grasslands) of the United States and Canada.
   They originally migrated from Europe and Asia over 10 000 years ago.

   In the past, American Indians used fire to deliberately create the large grasslands that provided the
   bison’s ideal habitat but they also kept the bison population regulated through hunting. Bison were
   a keystone species. This is a species which has a significant effect on the rest of the ecosystem
   in some way. Through their grazing they helped to preserve the grasslands.

   The bison provided the American Indians with meat, leather, sinew for bows, grease, dried dung for
   fires, and the hooves could be boiled for glue. When food was scarce, bison were even consumed
   down to the last bit of marrow. The American Indians were sometimes wasteful, but this was not
   significant as the bison herds easily sustained the small number of animals taken. Bison were the
   most numerous single species of large wild mammal on Earth.

Figure 7    Extract from a newspaper article


   Plains bison once numbered in the tens of millions but were wiped out by commercial hunting and
   habitat loss. By 1889 fewer than 1100 animals survived. In 1905 the American Bison Society
   began efforts to repopulate reserves on the Great Plains with animals from zoo herds. Of the
   estimated 500 000 Plains bison existing today, 20 000 are considered wild; the rest live on private
   ranches.

Figure 8     Wildlife Conservation Society report on the restoration potential of Plains bison



            Plains bison can thrive again, study says
   Plains bison could repopulate large areas from Alaska to Mexico over the next 100 years provided
   a series of conservation and restoration measures are taken, according to the Wildlife Conservation
   Society (WCS).

   Mountain forests and grasslands across Canada and the United States and parts of the desert in
   Mexico could also again support herds that once lived there. Ecological restoration would occur
   when large herds of bison could move freely across large, open landscapes within major habitats
   of their historic ranges. It would also include bison interacting with a wide range of other
   native species. The WCS say it is also important that the bison are able to inspire, sustain and
   connect human cultures.

   The researchers evaluated a range of factors, including the availability of existing habitat;
   potential for interaction with other native species (such as elk, prairie dogs and grassland birds);
   and the socio-economic and cultural factors in each location. The higher the score of these factors,
   the more likely restoration could take place. This is referred to as “restoration potential”.

   Ecological restoration could take up to 100 years, and will only happen through collaboration with
   a broad range of people.

Figure 9    Plains bison and human interactions in Prince Albert National Park, Canada


   There is a herd of 400 wild Plains bison in the Prince Albert National Park in Canada. The herd is not
   fenced in, and so can come in and out of the park at will. The herd brings benefits to the ecosystem
   but causes problems for landowners near the park.

   The positive impacts of bison:
     • they create trails through the forest that are used by other animals and people
     • they modify vegetation through grazing
     • they disperse seeds caught in their fur and through their droppings
     • they are a food source for predators (e.g. wolves) and scavengers (e.g. ravens)
     • birds eat insects on bison, and use underfur for nests
     • their wallows (mud baths) allow for establishment of new plants
     • their droppings provide nutrients to soil
     • visitors come to the park to see them (ecotourism).

   The negative impacts of bison:
     • they damage/destroy farmland crops by grazing and wallowing
     • they can transmit disease to domestic livestock
     • they may damage fences so that domestic animals escape
     • they may wander on roads causing vehicle collisions.
