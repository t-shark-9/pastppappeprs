1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes
      clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases write a
      brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity,
      especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the
      candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end of the
      question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to the square
      bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and a note made
      to show that these marks have been transferred to the appropriate square bracket in the body of the script.

9.    For each option:   Add the totals for each question in the option and write it in the Examiner column on the
                         front cover.
      Total:             Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner column on
                         the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the front cover check your addition to ensure that you have not made an error.
      Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are checked and a
      note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a diagonal
      line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper,
      mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark, unless the candidate
      has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the front cover.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect
      in the left hand margin.

Subject Details:                     Chemistry SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the options [2 % 20 marks]. Maximum total = [40 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award more
      than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) - either wording can be
      accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent
      significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark. Where this point is
      considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by writing OWTTE (or words to that
      effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points.
      If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
      used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
      with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme, unit errors
      should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first point it occurs and U
      on the cover page.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for an error
      of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                             e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                     2        reject
                                                     1.6      accept
                                                     1.63     accept
                                                     1.631    accept
                                                     1.6314 reject

      Indicate the mark deduction by writing –1(SD) at the first point it occurs and SD on the cover page.

12.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct formula,
      similarly, if the formula is specifically asked for, do not award a mark for a correct name.

13.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do not
      award a mark for a word equation or an unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

14.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

G4. (a)   phenol;
          negative charge/lone pair on oxygen can interact with delocalized electrons of
          benzene/aromatic ring so spreads out charge more / OWTTE;                                [2]

    (b)   chloroethanoic acid;
          chlorine (atoms) withdraws electrons from OH bond, making it break more easily to
          release H + ions / electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine / greater electronegativity
          of chlorine / OWTTE;
          ClCH 2 CO 2 − more stable than CH 3CO 2 − because negative charge spread more /
          OWTTE;                                                                                   [3]
