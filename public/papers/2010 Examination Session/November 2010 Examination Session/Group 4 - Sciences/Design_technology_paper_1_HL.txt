Questions 37–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the Ultracane manufactured by Sound Foresight Ltd (UK).  It was developed
for use by blind and partially-sighted people.  In development it was called the “Bat cane” as it bounces
ultrasound off objects and feeds back information to the cane.  The feedback is not audible but tactile so it
does not interfere with other hazard information.  Buttons on the cane indicate the direction of the object and
the intensity of the vibration lets the user know how far away the object is.  The Ultracane is manufactured
from a lightweight composite material and is available in 10 different lengths.

                    Figure 2: Ultracane controls                                      Figure 3: Ultracane in use
