1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made to show that these marks have been transferred to the appropriate square bracket in the
      body of the script.

9.    For each Option: Add the totals for each question in the Option and write it in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:           Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made an
      error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      unless the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  18 marks].
Maximum total = [36 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

Option A — Human nutrition and health

           with vitamin D: (from 0.0 to) 1.7µmol  (units required – allow answers in
                                                    
A1. (a)
                                                  the range of 1.65 to 1.75 μmol)

                                                         (units required – allow answers in
           without vitamin D: (from 0.0 to) 1.1µmol                                                       [1]
                                                         the range of 1.05 to 1.15 μmol)

           Both needed to award the mark.

     (b)     both increase with time;
             normal mice have a greater increase in blood calcium levels than mutant mice
             (after ten minutes);
             normal mice have a maximum change of 1.1 µmol while mutant mice have a
             maximum change of 0.6 µmol ;
             mutant mice show gradual increase while normal mice show rapid increase
             followed by a plateau;                                                                    [2 max]

     (c)     mice with low calcium diets have a greater increase in blood calcium levels
             (after calcium administration) because their body absorbs more calcium;
             if they have had a high calcium diet they do not need to absorb so much calcium
             / vice versa;
             probably receptors are all occupied/inhibited / less receptors;                           [2 max]

     (d)     hypothesis supported as blood calcium levels increased in mutant mice after
             intake of calcium (graph A);
             but less than in normal mice / perhaps not enough to cure disease/rickets;
             administering vitamin D also shows an increase in blood calcium levels (graph A);
             but no good administering vitamin D as the receptor is defective;
             in a high calcium diet, less absorption occurs (graph B), so might not be the solution;
             should have tested mutant mice with different diets;                                      [2 max]

A2. (a)       (i)       causes sensation of being full/having eaten too much (when receives
                        messages);
                        stimulated by hormones (insulin, CCK) produced by pancreas/small
                        intestine after eating;
                        stretch receptors in stomach after eating;
                        hormones (leptin) produced by adipose tissue in response to fat storage;
                        send message to appetite control centre in brain;                          [3 max]

              (ii)   BMI of 16 (kg m 2 ) is underweight so there is a health risk;
                     underweight so may be taking in insufficient nutrients;                       [1 max]

      (b)       Component                  Human milk                   Artificial milk

A3.         food miles are a measure of how far food is transported to consumption site;
            high food miles cause pollution/greenhouse gas emissions/increased fuel consumption
            for transport;
            traffic congestion / road damage;
            allows continuity of supply / increase in choice;
            maintenance of subsistence crop production (in undeveloped/developing countries);
            high food miles do not support local communities;
            food may not be as fresh as local produce / use more preservatives;                    [4 max]

Option B — Physiology of exercise

B1. (a)    positive/direct correlation / as mitochondrial concentration increases so does
           HAD activity                                                                               [1]

     (b)      fur seal has greater mitochondrial concentration / vice versa;
              fur seal has greater HAD activity / vice versa;
              lowest value of HAD for fur seal equal to/slightly above highest sea lion value/
              no overlap of data points;                                                          [2 max]

     (c)      swimming muscle has a greater mitochondrial concentration than
              non-swimming muscle;
              the range in HAD activity is similar in both / non-swimming has slightly larger
              range;
              mitochondrial concentration overlaps in the middle range of values /
              low mitochondrial concentration only in non-swimming muscle / highest
              mitochondrial concentration only in swimming muscle;                                    [2]

     (d)      more mitochondria means more aerobic respiration;
              more mitochondria in swimming muscles;
              products of fatty acid oxidation could be used in respiration (so hypothesis
              could be supported);
              increase in HAD activity would mean an increase in fatty acid oxidation;
              little/no increase in HAD activity in swimming muscles (so hypothesis not
              supported);
              during diving low oxygen/hypoxic conditions so high HAD activity/
              mitochondrial concentration allows aerobic metabolism to continue;                  [3 max]

     (b)   vital capacity may increase slightly/appears to be unaffected by training;                 [1]
           Do not award the mark for increase that is unqualified.



B3. (a)    moderate-intensity exercise stimulates development (in size) of slow muscle
           fibres whilst high-intensity exercise stimulates development (in size) of fast
           muscle fibres;
           both decrease heart rate at rest;                                                          [2]

     (b)      benefits:
              more red blood cells after transfusion so more transport of oxygen by hemoglobin;
              enhances endurance; OWTTE
              risks:
              foreign blood could cause rejection / own blood banks to avoid rejection/
              disease transmission;
              excess of red blood cells causes clots;
              bigger volume of blood increases blood pressure;
              unethical/unfair advantage to athlete results in banning/disqualification;          [4 max]
              To award [4 max] at least one risk and one benefit must be addressed.

              Both needed to award the mark.

      (b)     wild-type enzyme has greater activity than the mutant enzymes                                [1]

      (c)           inhibitor is similar in shape/structure to malonyl-ACP which is a substrate of
                    the reaction;
                    inhibitor is competing for the active site / competitive inhibition;
                    attaches to active site and does not let reaction occur;
                    if more substrate is added then the inhibition will be less;                       [3 max]

      (d)           activity of mutant enzymes without the inhibitor is always lower than wild-type;
                    activity of mutant enzymes with the inhibitor is always less than without;
                    but the differences are not as great as in the wild-type enzyme / the mutant
                    enzymes were less sensitive to the inhibitor;
                    the activity of the mutant enzymes with the inhibitor are always higher than the
                    activity of the wild-type enzyme with the inhibitor;
                    the data does not indicate whether these differences are significant or not /

    (b)   to increase the possibilities of fertilization                                           [1]

    (c)      to avoid interspecific/cross-fertilization;
             cross-fertilization usually not successful/non-productive;
             some overlap of species spawning occurs so temporal separation is not
             completely successful;
             example of overlap (e.g. D. strigosa overlaps with M. cavernosa/M. franksi);      [2 max]

    (d)   the phase of the moon / time of sunset / season/time of year / (water) temperature       [1]

    (e)      females always spawned after males suggesting hypothesis correct;
             for example in M. cavernosa or S. intercepta;
             difficult to tell for hermaphrodites;
             chemical analysis of water should be undertaken after males spawned / other
             chemical signals / further evidence required to support cause and effect;         [2 max]

             interaction between excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic neurons with the
             postsynaptic neuron;
             excitatory and inhibitory produce different neurotransmitters;
             the impulses from presynaptic neurons are generally summative;
             decision-making is a (mental) process leading to the selection of alternatives/
             strategies / frontal cortex/lobes are brain regions involved in decision-making
             processes;                                                                        [3 max]



E3. (a)      classical conditioning;
             Pavlov sounded a bell before food / conditioned stimulus;
             dogs salivated when they heard the bell / conditioned response;
             the amount of salivation after the bell was as great as when the food alone was
             presented;
             dogs had learnt to associate the two external stimuli;                            [3 max]

    (b)      sound waves reaching eardrum cause it to vibrate;
             vibrations passed to bones of middle ear/oval window/fluid in cochlea;
             detected by mechanoreceptors/hair cells (in cochlea of ear);                      [2 max]

               chickens have no resistant bacteria;
               both have approximately same percentage/number of E. coli resistant to 1 or
               3 antibiotics;
               egg laying hens have less incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria than chickens;   [2 max]

      (c)      hypothesis supported for poultry raised for meat but not for egg-laying;
               turkeys and chickens always have bacteria resistant to more antibiotics than
               egg laying hens;
               antibiotic-resistant bacteria are still found in egg laying hens even though
               antibiotics are rarely given;
               antibiotic-resistant strains (of bacteria) may have arisen by other means/other
               than by poultry being given oral antibiotics;                                         [2 max]

     (c)        both species show relationship between elevated precipitation and higher HBR
                (e.g. between week 0 and week 8 / week 100 and week 108);
                there is a lag between the period of precipitation and the increase in HBR;
                sometimes elevated precipitation does not lead to peaks of HBR (e.g. week 27);
                precipitation has a greater effect on Anopheles gambiae/A. gambiae;                     [3 max]

                primary succession occurs on bare/lifeless substrate;
                organisms move into an area and change its nature/pioneers colonize;
