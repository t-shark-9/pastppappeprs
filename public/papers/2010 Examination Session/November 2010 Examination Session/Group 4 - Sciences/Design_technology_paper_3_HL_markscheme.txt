1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
      awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next
      to the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made to show that these marks have been transferred to the appropriate square bracket in the
      body of the script.

9.    For each Option: Add the totals for each question in the Option and write it in the
                       Examiner column on the front cover.
      Total:           Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the front cover check your addition to ensure that you have not made
      an error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts
      are checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the front cover.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1  40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (    ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures unless it is specifically referred to in the
      markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. (a)    Award [1] for stating the name of the process which causes the dough to double in
           volume as shown in step 6.
           aeration;                                                                                [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying a reason for adding yeast to the pizza dough as shown in
           step 1 and [1] for a brief explanation.
           fermentation/the yeast produces carbon dioxide from the carbohydrate;
           the carbon dioxide aerates the dough and increases its volume;                           [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why the
           recipe for the pizza dough would have to be modified so that it would be suitable
           as part of a gluten-free diet.
           wheat flour contains gluten;
           a considerable number of people suffer gluten intolerance/coeliac disease
           (symptoms include chronic diarrhoea and fatigue in adults and failure to thrive in
           children);
           the wheat flour in the recipe needs to be replaced with a gluten-free alternative,
           e.g. potato flour or rice flour;                                                     [3 max]



A2. (a)    Award [1] for stating the Millennium Development Goal relating to food security
           to the effect of:
           halve, (between 1990 and 2015), the proportion of people who suffer
           from hunger;                                                                             [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying each of two criteria for food security.
           sufficient food is available;
           supplies are relatively stable;
           those in need of food can obtain it;                                                 [2 max]

A3. (a)    Award [1] for inserting the right numbers into the equation and [1] for a correct
           answer, including units.
            125
                   ;

           34.62 kg m 2 ;                                                                           [2]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying a reason why governments should raise public awareness
           of health issues relating to obesity and [1] for a brief explanation.
           increased risk of a range of serious health issues (e.g. high blood pressure,
           diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer);
           resulting in long-term illness;

           social responsibilities of government;
           informing of the potential for premature death;

           they put pressure on the health services for long-term care;
           this can cost the government a lot of money;

           obesity causes low self-esteem;
           this can lead to depression and added pressure on health services;

           moral responsibility;
           to educate/inform people of health risks/lifestyle choices;                          [2 max]




A4. Award [1] for identifying and [1] for each of two distinct correct points of explanation.
    Market pull:
    finding a market is critical to new food product development;
    market pull results from consumer demand;
    consumers want more choice, more convenience, cheaper foods, longer shelf lives;

     Technology push:
     new technologies can enable food product innovation;
     this can lead to new food products, e.g. snack foods, convenience foods;
     or it can lead to the enhancement of existing food products, more convenient, longer
     shelf lives;                                                                                   [6]

A5. (a)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of high-risk
          foods.
          foods which support the growth of food poisoning bacteria;
          e.g. milk, mayonnaise, fish, meat;                                                         [2]

    (b)   Award [1] for identifying one reason why uncooked poultry would be kept at the
          bottom of the refrigerator and [1] for a brief explanation.
          raw/uncooked poultry can harbor food poisoning bacteria, e.g. Salmonella;
          if liquid from the poultry were to drip onto other foods which were not cooked
          before eating this would result in food poisoning;                                         [2]

    (c)   Award [1] for identifying one reason why cheese and dairy products would be
          kept at the top of the refrigerator and [1] for a brief explanation.
          cheese and dairy products are high-risk foods which are often not cooked before
          consumption/eaten raw;
          food poisoning bacteria would therefore not be killed and could cause food
          poisoning;

          at the top of the refrigerator they will not be dripped on by other foods;
          risk of contamination by food poisoning bacteria is therefore reduced;                 [2 max]




A6. (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of an issue of
          public concern relating to the safety of genetically modified crops.
          does genetic modification change the food?;
          are genetically modified foods safe to eat?;
          will they cause allergic reactions or other diseases, e.g. cancer?;

          what are the environmental impacts of genetically modified foods?;
          will they cause gene transfer to other organisms?;
          will this contaminate the natural gene pool?;                                          [3 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of the
          importance of the acceptance by the general public in establishing a market for a
          food product.
          people are naturally wary of new food products;
          if the food product were not accepted rapidly enough then it would not be
          commercially viable;
          attitude to new food products is affected by a variety of factors e.g. culture,
          religion, etc.                                                                             [3]

A7. Award [1] for each of three distinct issues relating to the effectiveness of
    legislation governing food labelling as a means of altering diet [3 max] for each issue.
    dietary habits are a combination of culture and habit;
    food habits are very resistant to change;
    individuals must choose to change and food labelling is unlikely to have much impact
    on consumer decision-making;

     food labels provide a range of information;
     this information may not be readily understood by consumers;
     labelling relates to a specific product not to how that product is used as part of a
     balanced diet/in combination with other ingredients/food items;

     many government initiatives, e.g. the traffic light system, focus on fat, fibre, sugar and
     salt intakes;
     these relate to issues of high public concern, e.g. heart disease and diabetes;
     public reaction against the “nanny state” so that people ignore the information on
     the label;

     different supermarkets provide labelling in different ways;
     some ways may be less easily understood by consumers;
     this can lead to confusion;

     some labelling is not related to legislation e.g. “farm assured”;
     but manufacturers/retailers use the label as a form of promotion/quality assurance and
     place the label in a prominent position;
     consumers may only notice this type of label and not others hidden on the back of
     the package;

     many consumers purchase their food regularly from large retailers e.g. supermarkets;
     they place trust in the retailer to ensure food complies with legislation;
     so do not feel the need to examine labels themselves;

     consumers need to be aware of what to look for on a label;
     many consumers are ignorant of this issue;
     labels based on legislation are usually not very prominent on packaging;

     many consumers are pressed for time when shopping;
     and may be distracted by other things e.g. conversations with people, looking after their
     children;
     so they do not have the time/opportunity to examine the labels on products;                  [9 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of the combination of
           switches needed to be pushed to open the lock mechanism.
           A, C and D;
           NOT B,

B2. (a)    Award [1] for a definition of bit rate to the effect of:
           the number of bits/0s and 1s per second produced by a digital system;                    [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying one implication of limited bit rate capacity for a home
           security system and [1] for a brief explanation.
           the bit rate requirement is determined by the resolution of the image, the refresh
           rate and the number of monitors using the link;
           limited bit rate capacity will impact on resolution, refresh rate and or number of
           monitors;

           low bit rate;
           longer for system to respond to any data sent;                                       [2 max]

B3. (a)   Award [1] for identifying the ratio of Rf to Ra to achieve an amplification of ten
          times and [1] for a brief explanation.
           R f must be nine times R a ;
          gain 1 R f / R a ;                                                                    [2]

    (b)   Award [1] for stating why Ra and Rf should not be very low (e.g. less than 1 kΩ)
          and [1] for stating why they should not be very high (e.g. more than 10 kΩ).
          if too low then excessive current and energy will be wasted;
          if too high then damp air and other components will affect the ratio;                 [2]



B4. (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct point in an explanation of why the
          component values are suitable for producing a tune of approximately 20 seconds.

B7. Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of the limitations of an open
    loop control system [3 max] and how positive and negative feedback [3 max] each are
    used in a closed loop system to overcome these limitations.
    Limitations of an open loop system:
    there is no way of knowing if the output has responded to a change in the input;
    the output may be affected by the loading on the system;
    no sensor monitors the output and feeds back information about the current state of the
    output in comparison with the input requirement;

     How positive feedback is used:
     positive feedback occurs when an effect causes more of itself;
     it can be used to make a device oscillate between its maximum and minimum states;
     it is used when rapid, decisive switching or oscillation is needed;

     How negative feedback is used:
     negative feedback is used to correct output errors or to lower output to a pre-determined
     level;
     it is used to stabilise a system;
     e.g. the rotational speed of a lathe;                                                       [9 max]

           consumers need to be aware of how to care for products when they
           purchase them/consumers need to consider the cost of caring for products when
           they purchase them;
           if specialist care is required the consumer may prefer not to purchase the product;          [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each distinct correct point in an explanation of why there is a need
           for international standards for care labels.
           fabrics are global products;
           a garment produced in one country may be sold in another;
           therefore they need to be understood in different language contexts;

           market development;
           garments intended for global markets;
           need to take into account facilities for care of fabrics in different regions e.g. dry

    (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of
          why participatory design involving users helps designers to develop good
          user interfaces.
          it is difficult for the designer to understand all users’ requirements;
          a designer needs to look at the product through the eyes of a prospective user;
          interacting with users when they undertake specific tasks enables the designer to
          understand why an interface may not be easy to learn;                                   [3]



E2. (a)   Award [1] for a definition of digital human to the effect of:
          computer simulation of a variety of mechanical and biological aspects of the
          human body;                                                                             [1]

    (b)   Award [1] for identifying a way that digital humans enable the consideration of
          human factors early in the design cycle and [1] for a brief explanation.
          digital humans can be used in design development;
          before a physical prototype is built;

          the design can be optimized for use by people of different sizes/strengths;
          ensures comfort/visibility/access to controls/access and egress/reach/access for
          maintenance/ensures strength required to operate is within the normal range;        [2 max]

E3. (a)    Award [1] for identifying one reason why affordance is an important
           consideration in human factors design.
           affordance is a property of an object that indicates how it should be used;
           e.g. on doors, handles are for pulling/push plates are for pushing;                 [2]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying one reason why the use of the push plate on the right-
           hand door in Figure E2 is a better design for a door that needs to be pushed than
           the handle and sign used on the left-hand door and [1] for a brief explanation.
           the push plate on the right-hand door indicates simply that the door should
           be pushed;
           the handle on the left-hand door suggests that the door should be pulled and
           conflicts with the sign that says push and is confusing for users;                  [2]



E4. Award [1] for identifying each of two ways in which human factors specialists
    determine adequate product safety and [1] for each of two distinct correct points of
    explanation [3 max] per way.
    behavioural testing;
    performs a range of activities with the product;
    e.g. unpacking, assembly, operation, maintenance;

     conceptual testing;
     evaluates safety instructions and warning messages;
     people are not exposed to hazardous conditions;                                           [6]

E5. (a)   Award [1] for identifying one human factor issue related to wheelchair design and
          [1] for a brief explanation.
          anthropometric dimensions;
          the chair needs to be adjustable so that it fits its user;

          posture;
          the chair needs to enable the user support and a good posture;

          comfort;
          the chair needs to be adjustable so that it is comfortable for its user;

          pressure management;
          wheelchair users can get pressure sores from sitting in a poorly designed chair for
          too long;

          accessible controls;
          for a wide variety of users;

          biomechanics;
          force needed to turn the wheel;                                                       [2 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for identifying one way in which designers could research human
          factors for wheelchair design and [1] for a brief explanation.
          user research methods;
          involve wheelchair users and carers in the design process;

          research into existing products;
          identify design opportunities, e.g. through constructive discontent;

          expert appraisal;
          consult human factor specialists                                                      [2 max]

    (c)   Award [1] for identifying one benefit of the Internet for wheelchair users and [1]
          for a brief explanation.
          wheelchair users can purchase a product which precisely meets their needs;
          this is likely to be safer;

          they can purchase a range of products not just adapted products without the need
          to visit shops;
          this can make life much easier for them in terms of access to some shops;

          gain feedback from other wheelchair purchasers;
          in order to compare products/make an informed choice;

          they can take as long as they want to make a decision;
          no pressure selling from sales staff;                                                 [2 max]

E6. (a)    Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one reason
           why the designers of airport seating might design for discomfort.
           the airport management do not want people to be too comfortable on the
           airport seating;
           this will encourage them not to “nest” and take over areas of an airport lounge
           preventing others using it;
           saves disagreements in relation to territoriality;
           encourages people to move around the terminal/visit retail outlets;                   [3max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of the
           importance of international standards in airport signage.
           people fly into airports from all parts of the world;
           may not understand local language in a particular airport;
           international symbols are easy to understand and overcome the need for
           textual information;
           people are often in a hurry e.g. connecting flights;
           so they need to understand signs quickly/while on the move;                           [3max]



E7. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct point in an explanation of each of three
    advantages of paper prototyping [3 max] per advantage.
    cheap and easy to implement;
    it can be quickly and easily modified and retested in the light of user feedback;
    designs can be developed quickly;

     it involves users / participatory design / user-centred design;
     they represent the target market;
     therefore the final design should match the needs of the target market better;

     sophisticated designs often involve multi-disciplinary teams;
     paper prototyping promotes communication between team members;
     promotes a more holistic approach to the design process;

     no computer programming is required;
     therefore it is platform independent;
     it does not require programming skills;                                                     [9 max]
