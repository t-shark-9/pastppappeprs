1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next
      to the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made to show that these marks have been transferred to the appropriate square bracket in
      the body of the script.

9.    Section A:   Add together the total for each question and write it in the Examiner column on the
                   cover sheet.
      Section B:   Insert the total for each question in the Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:       Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                   Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the front cover check your addition to ensure that you have not made
      an error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts
      are checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [45 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  25 marks]. Maximum total = [95 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the
      first point it occurs and U on the cover sheet.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                      2      reject
                                                    1.6      accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept
                                                1.6314       reject

      Indicate the mark deduction by writing –1(SD) at the first point it occurs and SD on the cover sheet.
