1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin. For Section A this should be against each mark allocation
      shown in square brackets e.g. [2]. The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for
      the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work for Section A is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as
      ticks and a note made to show that these marks have been transferred to the appropriate
      square bracket in the body of the script.

9.    Section A:   Add together the total for each question and write it in the Examiner column on the
                   cover sheet.
      Section B:   Insert the total for each question in the Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:       Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                   Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made an
      error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      unless the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the
      first point it occurs and U on the cover sheet.

Section B
Extended response questions - quality of construction

      Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
           expression of relevant ideas with clarity
           structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
           The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
           answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
          The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
          of the same question (e.g. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
          etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

      It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of
       the question. Although, the part with the largest number of marks is likely to provide the most
       evidence.

      Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain
       the [2] marks for the quality of construction (and vice versa).

      The important point is to be consistent in the awarding of the quality points. For sample scripts
       for moderation the reason why quality marks have been awarded should be stated.

      Indicate the award of quality marks by writing Q2, Q1 or Q0 in red at the end of the answer.

     (b)         25% / 1 in 4 / 1:3 seeds produced would be homozygous recessive;
                 no response to/inhibits gibberellin in homozygous recessives results in less
                 germination;
                 less growth / dwarf plants produced; (must be in context)
                 would produce plants with infertile flowers that cannot produce rice grains;
                 would lower rice production/less yield because infertile plants cannot produce
                 seeds (that humans can eat);                                                   [3 max]

           (ii)    Sub1A is expressed strongly/the most / Sub1A produces the most RNA;
                   Sub1B (always) has the lowest expression/produces least mRNA;
                   Sub1A expressed/produces mRNA for the longest time/days 1 to 10;
                   Sub1C expressed/produces mRNA for the shortest time/days 3 to 7;                        [2 max]

     (d)   Sub1A;
           is only expressed in indica / Sub1B and SubC are expressed in both rice varieties;
           indica is the variety showing submersion tolerance / vice versa for japonica;                   [2 max]

     (e)   (i)        it increases the length of time before flowering                                         [1]

           (ii)       long-day light exposure increases time before flowering only if
                      (OsGI) gene
                      is not overexpressed/in WT and –/–;
                      long-day light exposure decreases time before flowering for +/– and/or +/+;
                      length of day does not make much difference/makes least difference for +/+;
                      overexpression for +/– reduces time before flowering;
                      –/– acts as a control / has nearly the same length of time before flowering as WT;   [2 max]
                      Accept numerical answers if they are making a clear comparison.

           (iii) is a short-day plant because WT has shortest time/shorter time before
                 flowering in shorter days than longer days / as it takes less time to flower
                 under short day conditions;                                                                   [1]

(f)   codominant alleles show intermediate phenotype when both present;
      could be codominant because homozygous +/+ shows longer time before
      flowering than heterozygous;
      –/– or homozygous not overexpressed has a slightly longer time before flowering
      than WT so factors other than codominance could be influencing flowering;
      dominance shown with short-day light exposure while codominance in long-day
      light exposure;
      because presence causes overwhelming difference compared with absence in
      short-day light exposure;
      OsGI + could be dominant because its presence always causes longer time
      before flowering;                                                                 [2 max]

(g)   the mutant gid1-1 would not be useful because it produces sterile plants;
      genetically modified rice/rice with Sub1A is more tolerant to submersion/can
      withstand seasonal flooding/torrential rain;
      OsGI + varieties adapted to different latitudes / day length could be produced
      (to overcome food shortages);                                                     [2 max]
