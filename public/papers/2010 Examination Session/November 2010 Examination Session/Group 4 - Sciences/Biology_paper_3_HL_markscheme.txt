1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made to show that these marks have been transferred to the appropriate square bracket in the
      body of the script.

9.    For each Option: Add the totals for each question in the Option and write it in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.
      Total:           Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made an
      error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts are
      checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      unless the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2       20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

    (c)        share 17 (out of 29) amino acids in common / more amino acids similar than
               different;
               both have Mn in the enzyme (as cofactor);
               greatest difference between them is from amino acid 18 to 22;
               mitochondrial has Gly (position 12) while E. coli (Mn) never has Gly;
               Leu is most common amino acid in both appearing four times / other valid
               comparison;                                                                             [2 max]

    (d)        divergent (evolution) as the cytoplasmic dismutase shows a greater number of
               differences (than the other three enzymes);
               divergent as convergent (evolution) implies existence of analogous structures
               and there are none here;                                                                [1 max]

    (e)        endosymbiotic theory states bacteria were engulfed by organisms to become
               mitochondria;
               sequence comparison between mitochondrial and bacterial dismutase supports
               this hypothesis;
               more similarity in the amino acid sequence between mitochondrial and
               bacterial dismutase than between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic dismutase;               [2 max]



D2. (a)   allele frequency: measurement of how often an allele appears (i.e. A or a);
          gene pool: total sum of all the genetic information available for reproduction
                      within the population;                                                           [1 max]

               the greater the differences, the longer the time span since the two species had a
               common ancestor;
               variation can be due to mutations;
               mutations are chance events so caution must be taken when interpreting these;           [3 max]

    (d)        organization of data helps to identify organisms;
               suggests evolutionary links;
               suggests the closeness of a relationship the more similar the characteristics are;
               allows prediction of characteristics shared by members of a group;                      [2 max]

      fossils being preserved is a rare event;
      fossils being found is a rare event; (e.g. due to geographical locations)
      chances of finding fossils is improved by searching in the right geological strata / OWTTE;
      poor data / fragmented remains / very small sample size;
      more prone to paradigm shifts/changes in theory when data is limited / discovery of a
      small amount of fossils can lead to a huge change in theories;
      paleoanthropology can still be considered a science e.g. Dmanisi, Georgia (falsification
      of earlier positions held);                                                                 [6 max]

             the cerebral cortex;
             endorphins act as painkillers;
             which block transmission of impulses at the synapses involved in pain transmission;   [3 max]

Option H — Further human physiology

H1. (a)      for both men and women a decrease is seen at the lowest alcohol intake
             followed by an increase;
             the level of CRP is higher in women than in men over the range of alcohol
             consumption / as the intake increases the difference between men and women
             increases, the CRP increase being greater in women;                                [1 max]

    (b)      drinking small amounts of alcohol seems to reduce the level of all markers /
             drinking none and/or high amounts of alcohol has higher levels of markers than
             moderate amount;
             the effect of small amounts of alcohol is less in women than in men / the effect
             of large amounts of alcohol is greater in women than in men / women should
             consume less than men;
             other effects of alcohol consumption are not measured;
             other factors increasing risk of CVD are not measured;
