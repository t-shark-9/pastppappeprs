Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions
• The maximum total = [35].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points:
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
      iv.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.
                                                  –4–                                       2225 – 6604M




1.   (a)   With reference to Figure 1(c), identify one type of vegetation that is found on the
           North Island but not on the South Island but not on the South Island.                     [1]

           Subtropical rainforest/shrub steppe;

           Do not accept only “rainforest/subtropical forest/steppe/shrub”.
           Only mark the first response if more than one answer is given.


     (b)   With reference to Figures 1(b) and 1(c), identify a relationship between altitude and
           type of vegetation.                                                                       [1]

     a.    Low/lower altitude is associated with bog/swamp/grass steppe/shrub
           steppe/subtropical laurel forest/subtropical rainforest/temperate broadleaf forest;
     b.    High/higher altitude is associated with alpine shrubland/highland steppe/temperate
           rainforest;
     c.    Mid/middle altitude is associated with temperate rainforest/temperate broadleaf
           forest;
     d.    Low/lower altitudes are associated with subtropical forests / mid/middle altitudes
           with temperate forests / high/higher altitudes are associated with grasslands;
     e.    The higher the altitude, the more grass steppe there is;
     f.    Zonation;

     Note to examiners: accept any other reasonable responses. Do not accept just “steppe”
     or “rainforest”, it must be specifically named for the appropriate altitude. Do not accept
     responses which simply state at which height range a specific vegetation type is located
     (e.g. Temperate broadleaf forest is located at 1000m-1249m) as this is not a relationship.

2.   (a)   Explain how tectonic plate movement has influenced evolution and biodiversity in
           New Zealand.                                                                              [3]

     a.    Movement of tectonic plates/divergent plates has/have led to separation/isolation of
           New Zealand/geographical separation of NZ/separate islands/created a physical
           barrier (e.g. the ocean) from other land masses / convergent plate movements has
           created mountains, acting as a geographical barrier;
     b.    Isolation of population/populations has led to speciation / allopatric speciation /
           separation of species prevented them from interbreeding, leading to speciation;
     c.    Isolation/separation of populations has limited gene flow, reducing genetic diversity;
     d.    As the island moved into a new climatic zone/as abiotic conditions change, species
           adapted/better suited to the environment survived / survival of the fittest;
     e.    Natural selection has contributed to the evolution of new species;
     f.    Evolution of species/speciation has enhanced the biodiversity;
     g.    Radiation/adaptive radiation has occurred over time;
     h.    Volcanic activity/mountain building as a result of tectonic plate movement has
           provided a variety of altitudes on the island, creating habitat diversity;

     (b)   (i)  With reference to Figure 2(c), identify the group of species which has the
           highest percentage in the threatened category.                                            [1]

           Freshwater fish
                                                   –5–                                       2225 – 6604M


           (ii)   Outline one reason the group of species identified in (b)(i) is the most
                  threatened.                                                                          [1]

           a.     Freshwater rivers/lakes/habitats are being polluted;
           b.     Detrimentally low water levels due to over-abstraction;
           c.     Habitat degradation/loss due to destruction/drainage of freshwater
                  systems/rivers/lakes;
           d.     dams/culverts/weirs which block migration/prevent fish from accessing
                  breeding/feeding grounds;
           e.     Over-fishing/over-harvesting as a result of changing diets/increased demand
                  for healthy proteins/increasing population (which increases the risk of
                  extinction/species loss) / increase in poaching/illegal fishing which exceeds
                  natural replacement rates;
           f.     Predation/competitive exclusion/competition by invasive/alien species
                  increasing risk of extinction/species loss;
           g.     High degree of endemism/limited distribution which increases their risk of
                  extinction;
           h.     Climate change altering water temperatures/flow regimes, which can reduce
                  reproductive success/habitat suitability;
           i.     Slow reproductive rates in some (endemic) species making adaptation to
                  changing conditions difficult/making them slow to recover from disturbances;
           j.     Reduction in precipitation/increasing evaporation due to climate change
                  reduces water levels;

           Note to examiners: Apply ECF if incorrect group of species is identified in 2.(b)(i).
           Do not accept just ‘loss of habitat due to climate change’.

3.   (a)   State one factor which could have contributed to the Kākāpō being classified as critically
           endangered on the IUCN Red List.                                                           [1]

     a.    Low/small population numbers/size / total population less than 250 mature individuals /
           low/small number of mature individuals;
     b.    Reduction in population size / population size reduced by more than 90% over the
           past 10 years or 3 generations (whichever is longer);
     c.    Limited distribution / small geographical range/distribution / small number of
           locations where the species is found / area of occupancy less than 10 km2;
     d.    High degree of habitat fragmentation;
     e.    Loss of habitat / habitat degradation / extent of occurrence less than 100 km2;
     f.    High probability/risk of extinction / probability of extinction is greater than 50% in 10
           years or 3 generations (whichever is longer);

           Note to examiners: the question does not refer specifically to Figure 3 and
           therefore all of the IUCN factors are acceptable as a response. Do not accept
           responses such as hunting or predation, as the question asks for the IUCN Red List
           factors.
                                             –6–                                        2225 – 6604M


(b)   Evaluate the strategy used to conserve the Kākāpō.                                         [3]

      Pros [2 max]:
      a.   Strategy is successful because the population has increased (since the mid
           1990s) / use of technology (e.g. Transmitters, artificial insemination, data
           tracking) has improved monitoring and breeding success / intensive
           management (e.g. supplementary feeding and nest interventions) has
           increased chick survival rates;
      b.   Predator eradication programme also benefits other native/endemic species;
      c.   Working together with a large range of stakeholders e.g. The Māori
           (indigenous people)/local groups/volunteers/government groups, provides
           ownership of the project and increases its chances of success;
      d.   Program adopts a variety of approaches increasing its chances of success;
      e.   Separating the birds into smaller, disconnected habitats is a good
           conservation design choice to reduce the risk of disease spread/natural
           disasters putting the entire species at risk of extinction;

      Cons [2 max]:
      f.  The program does not address the issue of habitat loss;
      g.  The small number of Kãkãpõ has resulted in a small gene pool which can
          result in increase in genetic disorders/low breeding rates;
      h.  The population of Kãkãpõ are isolated from each other limiting the gene
          pool/genetic diversity;
      i.  In recent years/since 2020, population of Kãkãpõ have stabilized/are declining
          and appear to have reached carrying capacity;
      j.  Removal of predators may impact other species adversely;
      k.  Removal/killing of predators could be considered ethically wrong/is against
          their biorights / removal of predators decreases biodiversity;
      l.  This intervention program is very expensive/costly / The high final cost of the
          programme makes it difficult to sustain long-term without continued funding;
      m. Hunting/poaching of Kãkãpõ may still be occurring;
      n.  Successful breeding appears to be highly dependent on intervention by
          humans / reliance on human intervention (e.g. Hand-rearing, artificial
          incubation) means the species is not yet self-sustaining in the wild;
      o.  Limited number of suitable predator-free offshore islands restricts future
          population expansion;
      p.  Removal of predators is not complete so they are still a danger;

      Note to examiners: the answer must link the responses to the success/strengths or
      lack of success/weaknesses of the conservation strategy.

      Note to examiners: Conclusion [1 max] needs to be balanced considering both
      sides of the argument for credit and makes a clear value judgement e.g. Although
      the number of Kãkãpõ has increase over time, without further
      conservation/protection of their habitat the long-term survival of Kãkãpõ is unlikely.

      Conclusion is not mandatory and 3 marks can be achieved through consideration of
      both cons and pros.
                                                  –7–                                         2225 – 6604M


4.   Describe one possible impact of the change in forest cover shown in Figure 4 on soils.            [1]

     a.    Reduction in forest/trees reduces root system that holds soil together increasing risk
           of soil erosion/loss from wind/water;
     b.    With reduction in tree canopy/cover, there is increased risk of rain causing soil
           erosion;
     c.    Removal of forest canopy/loss of leaf litter may reduce quantity of organic matter in soil/may
           reduce nutrient input, leading to nutrient-poor soils;
     d.    Loss of forest cover can lead to soil compaction from exposure to wind/rain, reducing water
           infiltration;

     Note to examiners: do not accept responses which simply state the impact, without providing the
     mechanism for the impact e.g. Do not accept “deforestation causes soil nutrient loss” or
     “deforestation results in soil erosion”.


5.   (a)   Describe how the change in cattle numbers since 1990 shown in Figure 5(d), may
           have impacted the water quality of nearby rivers.                                           [1]

     a.    Increase in cattle may result in increase in nutrients (from
           manure/faeces/urine/fertiliser runoff) entering rivers causing eutrophication/increase
           BOD;
     b.    Increase in cattle may result in increase in sediments (from manure) entering rivers,
           increasing turbidity/reducing clarity of the water;
     c.    Increase in cattle may result in an increase in sediments (from manure) entering
           rivers that smother/kill riverbed organisms;
     d.    Increase in cattle may increase microscopic pathogens (from manure) entering
           rivers;
     e.    Increase in cattle may increase the trampling along riverbanks increasing erosion
           and sediment loading into rivers and reducing overall water quality / deforestation for
           increased cattle grazing exposes the soil to wind and water, increasing soil erosion
           and runoff into the rivers, increasing turbidity;
     f.    Increased water extraction for dairy farming reduces river flow, concentrating
           pollutants and reducing water quality;

     Note to examiners: response must indicate the impact on the water quality of the river.

     (b)   Outline two ways in which farming activity on the Canterbury Plains contributes to
           climate change.                                                                             [2]

     a.    Cattle (via enteric fermentation/belching/flatulence/flatus) produce methane which is
           a GHG;
     b.    Decomposition of manure produces methane, which is a GHG;
     c.    Combustion of fossil fuels in farm machinery produces carbon dioxide/CO2, which is
           a GHG;
     d.    Nitrous oxide is released from agricultural soil / fertilizers can release nitrous oxide,
           a GHG;
     e.    Land use change (such as converting forest or scrubland to pasture) reduces
           carbon sequestration (and increases CO2 in the atmosphere) / soil erosion results in
           CO2 release, turning it from a carbon sink into a carbon source;
     f.    Irrigation/intensive farming practices increase combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. water
           pumping), contributing indirectly to GHG emissions;
     g.    Increased agriculture can result in increased processing/transport to
           market/increased export overseas (which results in fossil fuel combustion)
           contributing GHG to the atmosphere;
                                             –8–                                          2225 – 6604M


(c)   Outline two ways in which climate change may impact farming within the Canterbury
      Plains in the future.                                                                        [2]

      a.    Increase in rainfall could increase soil erosion/degradation/cause
            flooding/leach nutrients and reduce crop yields;
      b.    Extreme dry weather periods/drought could reduce crop yields;
      c.    Extreme hot weather conditions could reduce crop yields/kill crops;
      d.    Extreme rainfall could result in flooding and death of livestock;
      e.    Extreme hot and dry conditions could lead to death of livestock;
      f.    Drought conditions could cause wildfires, killing livestock/causing loss of
            crops;
      g.    Increased risk of new pests and diseases reducing crop yields/killing livestock;
      h.    hotter temperatures increase evaporation, potentially causing soil salinisation;
      i.    Changes in climate could result in changing phenology of plants/pollinating
            insects, reducing success of pollination and reducing yields / changing
            phenology of insects and predator species may result in greater pest
            infestations, reducing crop yields;
      k.    Warmer temperatures may increase primary productivity/crop yields;
      l.    Rising sea levels may reduce land available for agriculture / rising sea levels
            may result in salinisation of soils/contamination of groundwater used for
            irrigation, reducing crop yields;

      Note to examiners: do not accept just ‘extreme weather’ or ‘climate change’ – the
      answer must specify the climatic condition which is impacting farming.

(d)   Suggest two ways in which agriculture in the Canterbury Plains could be adapted to
      deal with the impacts of climate change.                                                     [2]

      a.    Change the variety of crops grown which are more suited to new weather
            conditions/select more resilient crops/cultivars/shift towards salt-tolerant or
            drought-tolerant crops;
      b.    Breed livestock that are more suitable for changing climate;
      c.    Diversify agriculture to reduce risk of losing all crops during one season / use
            of agroforestry to reduce impact of extreme weather on crops/cattle;
      d.    Increase water resources to cover dry periods;
      e.    Improve land drainage to avoid risk of floods;
      f.    Implement precision agriculture (e.g. GPS-guided irrigation, soil sensors, drip
            irrigation) to optimise water use;
      g.    Use regenerative farming practices (e.g. cover crops, reduced tillage, crop
            rotation, organic fertilisers) to improve soil health/carbon storage/resilience to
            extreme weather;
      h.    Develop more effective pesticides to address new (tropical) pest species;
      i.    Shift to indoor farming, where growing conditions (e.g. temperature, water
            availability) can be controlled/kept stable;

6.    (a)   With reference to Figure 6, calculate the doubling time (DT) of the population
            of New Zealand.                                                                        [1]

      (70 / growth rate = 70 / 1.06 =) 66.038 (years) / 66.04 (years) / 66 (years)

      Note to examiners: Units are not required
                                                    –9–                                        2225 – 6604M


     (b)   Outline two factors which could change the expected doubling time (DT).                      [2]

           a.      Increase in doubling time due to migration out of the country / decrease in
                   doubling time due to immigration/in-migration;
           b.      Increase in doubling time due to increase in death rate due to disease e.g.
                   pandemic/increased cost of health care / decrease in doubling time due to
                   decrease in death rate due to advances in health care;
           c.      Increase in doubling time due to reduction in birth/fertility rates due to cost of
                   raising children / decrease in doubling time due to increase in births/fertility
                   rates as a result of government financial incentives;
           d.      Increase in doubling time due to reduction in birth/fertility rates due to anti-
                   natalist policies / decrease in doubling time due to increase in births/fertility
                   rates as a result of pro-natalist policies;
           e.      Increase in doubling time due to economic recession, delaying births /
                   decrease in doubling time due to economic boom;
           f.      Increase in doubling time due to emancipation of women (e.g. access to family
                   planning, contraception, higher education, employment), reducing fertility
                   rates/delaying onset of child-bearing/delayed marriage;

     Note to examiners: Responses must connect the answer to increasing/decreasing the doubling
     time. Do not accept catastrophic event/natural disaster as these are short-term events that are
     unlikely to have an appreciable effect on the doubling time.


7.   (a)   State one way in which New Zealand might achieve net zero carbon emissions
           without changing its energy source.                                                          [1]

           reforestation/afforestation / government regulations requiring carbon capture and
           storage (CCS)/CO2-reducing technology on all industries / strict government
           standards on energy efficiency / implementing carbon taxes / improving public
           transportation infrastructure / government limits/quotas on car purchases/ownership
           of private vehicles / providing benefits/rewards/incentives to encourage the use of
           renewables;

           Note to examiners: the response should focus on government/country level, rather
           than individual actions.

     (b)   With reference to Figure 7(b), calculate the expected percentage increase in
                                                                                                        [1]
           electricity generation between 2020 and 2050.
           ((70.0 – 41.8) / 41.8 × 100 =) 67.46 (%) / 67.5 (%) / 67 (%)

     (c)   Identify the type of renewable energy which is expected to increase the most between 2020
           and 2050 in Figure 7(b).                                                                [1]
           Wind;
           Solar;

     Note to examiners: there are two potential correct answers for this question. In terms of
     straight increase in % generation by source, wind is the greatest projected increase (17.5
     TWh). In terms of which source has had the greatest projected percent increase, solar is
     the greatest (4550%).

     (d)   Outline a strategy to achieve the renewable energy projections for 2050 as indicated
           in Figure 7(b).                                                                                [1]

           a.   Economic incentives/subsidies for installing solar panels/wind turbines /
                investment into other renewables such as tidal and wave energy (due to long
                coastlines);
           b.   Subsidies for batteries to store renewable energy / improved battery
                technology for storing renewable energy;
           c.   Making it easier to obtain planning permits for wind farms/solar farms /
                reduced bureaucracy in obtaining planning permission to build renewable
                energy sources;
           d.   Better rates for electricity generated through renewable sources rather than
                via fossil fuels / government taxation on the use of non-renewables/fossil fuels;
           e.   Public education and awareness campaigns to encourage household and
                business uptake of renewable technologies and energy-saving behaviours;
           f.   Investment in upgrading the infrastructure/national grid to integrate household
                sources/distribute variable renewable energy sources (like wind and solar);
           g.   Government ban/phase out on the use of fossil fuels;
           h.   Increased investment in research and development/developing technology to
                make renewables more efficient/reliable;

     Note to examiners: do not accept responses which relate to individual actions, as this
     question refers to a strategy.


8.   With reference to Figures 8(a) and 8(b), compare and contrast the ecological footprint and
     biocapacity between New Zealand and the World.                                                 [3]

     Similarities [max 2]:
     a.   Both have declining biocapacity over time;
     b.   The EF for both regions are fluctuating;
     c.   Prior to 1970, both New Zealand and the world average had an ecological
          surplus/EF was lower than the biocapacity;

     Differences [max 2]:
     d.    The biocapacity falls below the EF for the world whereas/however the biocapacity
           stays above the EF for NZ / New Zealand maintains an ecological reserve/surplus
           whereas/but/however the world operates in an ecological deficit;
     e.    The biocapacity for NZ has fallen from approximately 21 to 8 (global
           hectares/person) compared to the world, which has fallen from approximately 3.2 to
           1.6 (global hectares/person) / the biocapacity in NZ has fallen more (greater
           decrease in hectares per capita/13 gph/capita) than the world (1.6 gph/capita);
     f.    The biocapacity in NZ is higher than (the biocapacity) for the World;
     g.    The overall EF for New Zealand (above 5) is greater that the EF of the world (about
           2.5) / World EF is smaller than New Zealand’s EF;

     Note to examiners: do not accept unrelated statements without an element of
     comparison or contrast e.g. higher than, both.
                                                  – 11 –                                     2225 – 6604M


9.   With reference to the information in the resource booklet, to what extent can New Zealand
     be considered to be living sustainably?                                                          [6]

     Arguments that New Zealand is living sustainably [4 max]:
     a.  The EF is below the biocapacity of the country and therefore is sustainable;
     b.  Proportion of energy generated from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro,
         geothermal) is high and rising, which reduces GHG emissions/which reduces fossil
         fuel use;
     c.  By 2050, all of New Zealand’s electricity is projected to be from renewable sources
         of energy rather than fossil fuels/reducing GHG emissions;
     d.  New Zealand is attempting to conserve native/endemic species / conservation
         efforts have increased the numbers of the critically endangered Kãkãpõ;
     e.  The EF for NZ is beginning to fall/is decreasing, suggesting that they are trying to
         live more sustainably;

     Arguments that New Zealand is not living sustainably [4 max]:
     f.  Biocapacity is continuing to decline over time and this is not sustainable in the long
         term;
     g.  EF of New Zealand is greater than the overall biocapacity of the world which is not
         sustainable / New Zealand’s ecological footprint per capita remains high (approx. 5
         gha/person), indicating overconsumption compared to global sustainable limits (~1.6
         gha/person) / EF of New Zealand is much higher than the world average, which
         suggests they are consuming resources at a high/unsustainable rate;
     h.  59%/majority of energy used by New Zealand comes from fossil fuels, which release
         GHG/contribute to climate change/are finite/non-renewable;
     i.  New Zealand imports/uses fuel oil which is not renewable/when used produces CO2
         which is a GHG/contributes to climate change;
     j.  New Zealand has a high level of car ownership which produces carbon dioxide
         which is a GHG/contributes to climate change/contributes to photochemical smog;
     k.  Continued reliance on high-emission sectors (e.g. agriculture and transport) makes
         emissions reduction more difficult (despite renewable electricity progress);
     l.  Livestock farming has grown significantly over time contributing to methane
         production/water pollution;
     m. Intensive (arable) farming uses fertilizers which can lead to eutrophication of rivers /
         intensive arable farming use pesticides which can pollute rivers/kill non-target
         organisms/cause soil/water toxification / intensive farming has a heavy use of
         machinery which results in the combustion of fossil fuels/releases CO2;
     n.  New Zealand has lost large areas of forest/deforestation which has increased the
         risk of soil erosion/loss of habitats/loss of endemic species/loss of biodiversity/loss of
         a carbon sink;
     o.  Introduced predator species/invasive species continue to threaten the biodiversity of
         New Zealand;
     p.  Some species cannot survive without continued human intervention;
     q.  Population/immigration is increasing and therefore there will be a greater demand for
         resources in the future;
     r.  A high proportion of NZ’s (endemic) species are threatened or at risk which suggests
         they are not living sustainably/that conservation measures have not been successful;


     Note to examiners: Award [5 max] for pros and cons combined. Reserve one mark for
     the conclusion..
     Conclusion [1 max]
     For example: Although the ecological footprint for New Zealand is below its biocapacity
     which makes it appear sustainable, its use of imported oil/fossil fuels means the country is
     not truly sustainable;
                                             – 12 –                                     2225 – 6604M


A valid conclusion should be credited if it is explicit, balanced (addresses both sides of the
argument) supported by evidence and makes a clear value judgement. Do not credit the
conclusion if only one side of the argument has been considered within the overall
response.

Accept other reasonable responses supported by the information in the resource booklet.
