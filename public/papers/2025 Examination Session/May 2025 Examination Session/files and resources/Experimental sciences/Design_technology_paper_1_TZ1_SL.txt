Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

In 2023 Levi Strauss & Co celebrated the 150-year anniversary of their most iconic product the 501®
Original jean, see Figure 6. Manufactured using denim fabric, the garment has stood the test of time
to become a classic design owing to its durability, practicality and use of the cotton fibre.

Levi’s® continue to be innovative and in 2022 they launched a new version of the 501® Original jean.
Made with organic cotton, post-consumer recycled denim is designed to be recyclable but still offers the
same comfortable textile properties.

Originally designed as work clothes for gold miners’ Levi’s® jeans have been worn through the ages and
across cultures.
