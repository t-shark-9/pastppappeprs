Subject details:               Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A:       Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B:       Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
                 Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional. Do
not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
semi-colon (;).

An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be accepted.

Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that in
the markscheme then award the mark.

Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips. In
this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent parts.
If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used
correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of               eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses        descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the           explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions        This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                   explanation etc.

8.    Award max [3].

       Award [1] for a reason/example/scenario where VPN is relevant.
       Award [1] for a feature of VPN (encryption, tunnelling, leak protection, data or bandwidth caps,
       zero-logs policy, IP shuffling, kill switch). (Accept either a term/name or a description of a feature.)
       Award [1] for an elaboration.


     Note: The reason/example/scenario, feature and elaboration must work as whole coherent answer.
     The following answers are only examples there could be other appropriate answers.


     Employees may use a VPN to access company’s network/internal resources/databases/ from
     remote location:
     VPN creates a tunnel;
     allowing secure connections and access (based on employees’ roles);

     Users who need a secure/private communication may use VPN;
     VPN encrypts data;
     and prevents hackers from intercepting sensitive information.;

     Users of insecure public Wi-Fi/ safer browsing while on public Wi-Fi;
     logging in on their socials/ purchasing something online/ leaving credentials;
     VPN lets connect to the provider’s servers creating a private tunnel that secures data;


     Users may use a VPN to give themselves more privacy/ anonymity online/ avoid geographical
     limitations;
     IP address is masked so the location of the user is not known;
     So they can visit websites that are restricted by location/ online businesses use geographic
     segmentation which means prices of product that can be bought and sold (books, airline tickets,
     clothes) vary depending on the buyer’s location/ may be essential if a country is likely to block
     internet content from foreign entities, for example, journalists could use a VPN to look like they are
     within that country (Accept any legitimate reason for needing to be unknown) ;

     Use of a VPN during days and times when a lot of people trying to stream content and download files
     at the same time / to avoid congestion (during peak times of internet usage);
     With a VPN user can choose what network their traffic travels on;
     So, VPNs can (sometimes even) increase the internet speed;

     VPNs can be used for bypassing network restrictions;
     to access certain blocked websites;
     VPNs can tunnel around the restrictions;

     Internet/social media users (streaming, online gaming, etc.) may use VPN to avoid
     tracking/surveillance;
     because VPN hides the type of traffic;
     and it can prevent the risk of getting frequent advertisements/ the risk of bandwidth throttling (slowing
     down) by ISP provider;

                  Award [1] for a benefit and [1] for a reasonable expansion, x2.

                    Increased productivity;
                    CAD software automates most of the architect’s tasks which allows quicker project
                    completion/ the same amount of time can result in a greater number of completed
                    projects;

                    Flexibility to modify designs;
                    Allows for changes and revisions to be visualized and approved;
                    Decreased architect’s effort;
                    the different parts of code and drawings can be modified easily then reused multiple
                    times;

                    Saves time;
                    Easy/quick to create/edit/ make alterations in the drawings;

                    Saves cost/money;
                    a model could be created using CAD, and modified before the structure/product is
                    produced (if it does not work, it could cost the architect more money to create again);

                    Better quality of drawings/ realistic designs/ better visualization of the product;
                    The CAD makes use of best tools (that allow creation of precise complex drawings of
                    surfaces and shapes);

                    Improved accuracy;
                    CAD tools include many mathematical equations that perform vital calculations/examine
                    curves/surfaces;

                    Fewer errors;
                    the CAD software makes use of tools to investigate an error, diagnose the problem, and
                    solve it;

                    Easy to share work with colleagues/clients;
                    The CAD tools make it easier to save the files and store it in a way that they can be used
                    again and/or sent;

                    Integration with other tools;
                    CAD designs can be given to a 3D printer or CAM for direct implementation;

            (PIN/ token/ biometrics/ two-factor authentication (2FA) before accessing a file/ through
            whitelisting/blacklisting devices/ by verifying MAC addresses);
            Users assigned an administrator role have full access to the system/ are allowed to perform
            most operations on the system (such as, add, remove, edit users, groups, domains, manage
            passwords, configure services, etc.);
            Users assigned a teacher role have read-write access to update student grades/ read-only
            access to students’ records/ no access to other teachers’ financial records;
            A user assigned a student role has read access to their reports / no access to other students’
            /teachers’ data;
            A user assigned a guest role has restricted/limited access to certain file/folders/information
            / no access to the files with sensitive or personal data/ users with guest accounts can only read
            from files containing general information/ guest users cannot perform any actions/ guest users
            can only browse the internet);

            Example 2:

            Create a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) that allows segmentation of different user groups;
            Each VLAN uses strong authentication/ user logins /two-factor authentication;
            Each VLAN can have specific security policies/ rules and restrictions;
            Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) on devices/ define what resources each group of users
            can access/ assign permissions based on user roles (RBAC);
            Administrators have full access to all resources;
            Teachers have access to their personal records/teaching materials/authorized student data;
            Students have access only to their own files/ assignments/ reports / no access to others' data;
            Guests have internet access only/ restricted access through firewall and ACLs / no access to
            sensitive information;

            Example 3:

            Intranet and extranet could be implemented;
            The intranet is restricted to group of users related to the school
            (administrator/teachers/students);
            Each teacher/student has login, password (and permissions);
            Administrators have full access to all resources (intranet and extranet);
            Teachers have access to their personal records/teaching materials/authorized student data;
            Students have access only to their own files/ assignments/ reports;
            Extranet is accessible to all (administrator/teacher/student/guest) / Extranet provides limited
            access from outside the LAN for all users working remotely;
            Guests have access to Internet;

      (b)     Award max [4].
              Award max [2] for pros and max [2] for cons.

            Pros:
            Better control over traffic flow/ any problem appearing at one traffic light is known immediately/
            can be dealt with immediately;
            Traffic lights can be quickly adapted to avoid traffic blocks/ when levels of traffic flow change;
            All traffic lights can be synchronized efficiently, allowing smooth traffic flow across the city (e.g.,
            creating green waves on main roads);
            Easier to add additional hardware/ inputs such as sensors;
            Cheaper-reduces the need for separate hardware (controllers or advanced systems) at each
            intersection/ cheaper maintenance;
            Centralised data collection (accidents, traffic) that could help with future planning;
            Control program can be done at one place, with different programs for different times of day and
            related traffic patterns;
            easier maintenance/software updates can be performed centrally without having to make
            adjustments at every intersection;


            Cons:
            single point of failure - failure of the central computer stops the entire city's traffic
            system;
            system depends on high-speed communication links, network failure can disrupt activity;
            the capacity/speed of the central computer can be limited/cannot provide the desired levels of
            service (many inputs with differing priorities which could take time);
            high initial cost of communication system/central control system/software;
            security risks/cyberattacks on the central computer affects the entire city;
            reduced local autonomy/ individual intersections cannot make local decisions like dealing with
            an unexpected blockage/ emergency;
            difficult to scale up as the city expands (system may struggle to handle increased load) /
            disruption in service/ increased complexity in decision-making and processing;

            Note: Reward other reasonable benefits and drawbacks.

      Interrupt can occur at any point in time (an interrupt is asynchronous);
      processor polls the devices at regular intervals of time (polling is a synchronous activity);

      Interrupt occurs only when a device requires servicing;
      Polling occurs when processor needs to wait and check if a device needs to be serviced/
      processor continuously checks the status of the device to find whether it requires attention;

      Interrupts save the processor cycles;
      polling wastes many of the processor cycles;

      Interrupts are priority based;
      Polling involves sequential checking with no priority;

      Interrupts allow the CPU to respond quickly to a situation;
      Response may be delayed depending on polling order / frequency;

      Polling involves creating a software loop (to regularly and continuously read sensor data);
      Interrupt is a hardware mechanism (in which the sensor notices processor that it requires its
      attention);

             The (difficult) program is divided into several easier parts (sub-programs);
             The program is better organized/ easier to understand /reduced size of code (due to several
             sub-programs calls)/ no duplication of code;
             Sub-programs hide implementation details;
             Sub-programs keep specific tasks self-contained;
             Each of the sub-programs could be written independently;
             Each of the sub-programs is debugged/tested independently;
             Different parts of the program can be written at the same time/concurrently;
             Sub-programs speed up the development process (as different students can work
             on different subprogram at the same time);
             Each sub-program could be used many times in this program (and in other programs);
             The maintenance/modification/change of the program will be easier/faster
             (because only a sub-program could be changed/modified as needed);
