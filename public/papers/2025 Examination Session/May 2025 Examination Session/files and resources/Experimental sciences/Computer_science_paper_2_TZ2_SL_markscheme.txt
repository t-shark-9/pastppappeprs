Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional. Do
not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
  in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
  rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
  In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
  used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
  “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

         Award [1 max] description of conceptual schema
         Award [1 max] description of logical schema

         The conceptual schema is a high level/least detailed representation of the database;
         Conceptual is sometimes described as the “what” Model;
         Involves identification of entities and (high level) relationships between them;

         The logical schema is more detailed than a conceptual schema and shows details such as field
         names;
         Logical schema is sometimes described as the “How” Schema;
         Logical schema is developed from the Conceptual schema;


   (b)   Award [2 max]
         Award [1 max] explanation of why DDL is important
         Award [1 max] example of use

         A DDL is used to specify the schema of a database;
         A DDL allows you to define the tables, fields, and set datatypes (e.g., CREATE TABLE);
         A DDL allows you to specify keys/create relationships;
         A DDL allows you to modify schema (e.g. DROP, ALTER);

         Note: Award 1 mark for any valid DDL command term


   (c)   Award [4 max]
         Award [1] explanation and [1] for example x 2

         It helps to identify the entities/tables in the database;
         If incorrect, they will not support the purpose of the DB;

         The attributes of the tables should be necessary and sufficient for the purpose;
         To avoid inefficiencies in the operation of the database;

         The keys for accessing the tables need to be identified;
         To ensure the user can easily access the data;

         The relationships between tables are identified;
         To enable the user to perform complex queries across several tables;

         Normalization during data modelling reduces data duplication;
         Which reduces data anomalies;
         And saves storage space;

         Enables the database structure to be understood by other stakeholders/analyst/programmers;
         Which makes database maintenance easier;
                                              –8–                                         2225 – 6418M



(d)   Award [3 max]
      Data validation is an automated process that ensures input meets the data entry rules) / Data
      validation is an automated process that ensures input data is reasonable/valid;
      Data verification is the checking of data to ensure it is the input intended;
      Using both techniques will provide the optimal solution, data validation can be applied to fields
      where the values can be easily determined (for example, no date of birth before a specified
      date), then data verification allows checking where data validation is not possible/appropriate
      (for example, a person’s surname);
      Award one mark for each definition [max 2] and one mark for linkage [1]

(e)   Award [2 max]
      Integrity is maintained by no changes being made until the transaction is complete;
      If the transaction cannot be completed it is rolled back (to the original state);
      Atomicity (all or nothing): change made or no changes made;

      Consistency ensures a transaction does not put the database in an invalid state;
      Rules and integrity constraints (validation, entity and referential integrity) are automatically
      enforced before a transaction is committed;
      Preventing anomalies like orphan records and erroneous data;

      Isolation prevents interference between concurrent transactions;
      Which ensures intermediate/uncommitted values of one transaction are not visible to other
      transactions;
      Through the use of locks and other concurrency control measures;
      Preventing errors like the lost update, dirty reads, phantom reads etc;

      Durability ensures that the effects of a committed transaction are permanent (irrespective of a
      subsequent system failure);
      Transaction logs record all the changes made during transactions;
      If a system failure occurs, the committed transactions in the log are reapplied to the database
      during recovery;
      Data integrity is ensured by preventing data loss;

      Note: Award 1 mark if a student only refers to ACID properties without any expansion


(f)   Award [2 max]
      Referential integrity refers to relationships between tables in a database;
      Referential integrity is maintained by the connection between the primary key in one table and
      the foreign key in another;
      Which ensures records are appropriately updated (e.g. FK value cannot be changed to a value
      that does not exist as a PK);
      It cascades updates and deletes from the PK table to the FK table;
      To prevent update anomalies and orphan records;

3. (a) (i)      Award [2 max]
                A derived field is calculated by using data that exists within the database;
                That means the data does not have to be input / does not take up storage space;
                A derived field has currency as it is calculated/derived at the time so accounts for changes in
                date etc;

         (ii)   Award [2 max]
                Award [1] for identifying the data from the database;

      Command term is Discuss – requires balanced review with conclusion clearly supported.

      black Hat Search Engine Optimisation is manipulating the search engine guidelines/rules to gain
      a higher search ranking and therefore potentially increased share of revenue or improved traffic;

      Black hat techniques include:
      keyword stuffing, poor/low quality content (duplicated content or rewritten content), hidden
      keywords, paid links and link farming, cloaking (Showing one piece of information to SE and
      different to users), “sneaky redirects”, blog comment spam and ranking stuffing;

      Advantages:
      brings increased traffic/visitors;
      directs user to content, developer wants them to see;
      gives a higher search engine ranking based on number of hits;
      potentially increases revenue;

       Disadvantages:
      reputational damage
      search engine penalties for inappropriate techniques;
      blacklisting
      lower search engine score / Initial ranking may improve, but long-term score can drop if detected
      and penalized by search engines.
      flagged as an unsafe site;
      ethical issues—inaccurate, unreliable, inappropriate content etc;
      Conclusion:
      candidates need to present a position and support their decision. Award marks for the support
      of the position rather than stating their position.

      Note: Responses should focus on the organization (e.g., Xero) as the primary stakeholder when
      evaluating the use of black hat SEO techniques.

   (c)   Award [6 max]
         Award [2 max] for conceptual understanding
         Award [2 max] for positive impacts on privacy
         Award [2 max] for negative impacts on privacy

          Conceptual understanding
         the decentralised web is where operation, ownership and control of the internet is decentralised
         to the users away from the major organisations like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc;
         the decentralised web uses peer-to-peer. No one entity has control of the web;
         decentralisation means that there is less opportunity for censorship; people can say what they
         want, but also removing data is potentially harder as control is not from a single point;

          Positive impacts on privacy
         individual control means that the user can allow or restrict information sharing, thus potentially
         improving privacy by reducing third- party access to the data/information;
         ownership of the data remains with the user;
         decentralisation removes the middleman in data transfers, enabling direct transfer of data and
         therefore greater control and privacy. Middle man could be organisations/entities that act as
         mediums for data transfer;
         cryptocurrencies are an aspect of the decentralised web and bring privacy and security to
         financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies are usually in decentralised control. Cryptocurrencies
         use strong encryption to secure the transaction records;
         decentralisation reduces the surveillance on user activities, as the activity may be direct and not
         monitored or logged. This increases privacy;

Negative impacts on privacy

since there is no overall control, there is the ability to publish any information by anyone;
the decentralised web operates on a trust model. This makes it harder for an individual to take
down a page and harder for an organisation or government to restrict access;
decentralized systems may lack consistent privacy standards, exposing users to platforms with
weak or nonexistent protections;
because data is stored across multiple nodes, there is a greater surface area for potential
breaches or leaks;
accountability is often unclear in decentralized systems, making it difficult for individuals to seek
recourse for privacy violations;
decentralisation may mean that some of the data is stored in systems that are not as secure and
do not conform to industry practices, thus making them more vulnerable to illicit activity;
cryptocurrencies are an aspect of the decentralised web and bring privacy and security to
financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies are usually in decentralised control. Cryptocurrencies
use strong encryption to secure the transaction records;

                memory efficiency;
                primitive data types take up less memory than objects / which makes them more efficient
                when working with large data sets / in memory constrained environments;

                faster access to data/ faster to manipulate than objects/ performance;
                because primitive data types are stored directly in memory and are processed by the
                CPU using registers;

                primitive data types are simple/ well-defined data types/ easy to work with (in terms of
                arithmetic operations and logical comparisons);
                that can be easily understood/ used by programmers;

                primitive data types can be passed between different programming languages/systems;
                which makes them useful for cross-platform development and interoperability;

                primitive data types are passed by value;
                avoiding unintended side effects when passed as parameters;

                primitive data types are consistent across platforms;
                the size/ behaviour of a primitive data type will be the same regardless of the platform on
                which the code is running;

                 Code Reusability
                 developers can write more general and reusable code;
                 a function or method can work with objects of different classes that share a common
                 interface or base class;

                 Extensibility
                 polymorphism supports open/closed principle;
                 code is open for extension but closed for modification / new classes can be added with
                 little or no changes to the existing code;

                 Improved Maintainability
                 code is easier to maintain and scale;
                 because changes in one class do not affect others (if they share a polymorphic interface);

                 Simplified Code
                 eliminates the need for multiple conditional statements (like if-else or switch) by allowing
                 dynamic dispatch;
                 method calling is chosen at runtime based on the object’s type;

                 Supports Loose Coupling
                 objects are less dependent on specific implementations;
                 this increases modularity and makes the system more flexible and robust;

                 Data Hiding and Protection
                 sensitive data is hidden from outside interference and misuse;
                 only authorized methods can access or modify the internal state, reducing the risk of
                 unexpected behavior;

                 Improved Security
                 by controlling access through getter and setter methods;
                 developers can add validation logic, ensuring that the object’s state remains valid;

                 Ease of Maintenance and Flexibility
                 since internal implementation details are hidden;
                 changes can be made without affecting external code that uses the class, making
                 maintenance easier;

                 Enhanced Readability and Manageability
                 grouping related variables and methods together within a class;
                 makes code more organized and easier to understand;

                 Enables Abstraction
                 encapsulation lays the groundwork for abstraction;
                 by allowing the implementation details to be hidden while exposing only essential
                 features;

(iii)   Award [2 max]
        Award [1] for identifying the disadvantage, [1] for expansion

        Tight Coupling
        the child class is tightly coupled to the parent class;
        any change in the parent can unintentionally affect the child, potentially introducing bugs;

        Increased Complexity
        deep inheritance hierarchies can make the code hard to understand, debug, and maintain;
        difficult to trace where a method or variable is defined or overridden;

        Reduced Flexibility
        once a class inherits from a parent;
        it cannot inherit from another class, which can limit design flexibility;

        Overriding Misuse
        improper overriding in child classes can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs;
        especially when developers are not fully aware of how methods interact across classes;

        Performance Overhead
        in some cases, especially in languages with complex method resolution;
        inheritance may introduce a performance cost due to method lookups through the hierarchy;

(b)     Award [2 max]

        the Invoice class bundles/wraps the variables and methods into one unit;
        methods operate on the variables to manage access/updates;

        the variables (of the Invoice class) are private;
        preventing direct access from outside the class;

        the getter method getInvoiceID() is provided;
        to allow access to the private invoiceID;

        the setter method setQualifiesForDiscount() is provided;
        to allow access to the private qualifiesForDiscount;

        Note: The command term expects to ‘give a detailed account’. The candidate must identify and
        expand to get the full mark. Award only 1 mark if no reference to the Invoice class.

(e)   Award [2 max]
      Award [1] for identifying the advantage, [1] for expansion
      Easier / faster to debug;
      because there are far fewer mistakes in the smaller/individual modules;

      Speedier / faster completion of the project;
      because different teams work on different modules (simultaneously).

      Collaborative / qualitative development;
      as different teams work on different modules at the same time / teams (programmers) with
      expertise work on specific modules;

      Facilitates reusability of the code;
      as the existing modules can be reused across other modules;

      Improves code readability / organisation;
      smaller manageable modules leading to better logical organization;

      Reduces the coupling effect;
      leading to easier/faster maintenance of module not affecting others;
