Option A — Databases

1.   Alpha Hospital is situated in a large city and has over 1000 staff. It stores its data in a
     relational database.

     Some of the tables in this relational database contain data about the hospital staff, their roles,
     and the hospital departments.

     Staff roles include doctor, nurse, pharmacist, radiologist, and support staff. Staff can only
     hold one role.

     Departments include Accident and Emergency, Critical Care, Medical, General Surgery,
     Orthopaedics, and Ophthalmology. Staff can work in several departments.

     The ROLE table, STAFF table, and DEPARTMENT table are shown in Figure 1.

(Option A continued)

4.   Alpha Hospital is part of a wider health authority that manages several hospitals in the region.
     This health authority is planning to integrate the databases held by each hospital into a
     single database.

     The health authority is considering a range of database models for this integration.
     One model is a relational database.

     (a)   Identify two other database models that could be used to integrate the databases held
           by each hospital into a single database.                                                    [2]

     The National Health Authority wants to coordinate all data records in a data warehouse.
     Each regional health authority will provide the data that will be mined.

     (b)   Define the term data warehouse.[2]

     (c)   Explain why the extract, transform, load (ETL) process is used to prepare data for
           data warehousing.                                                                           [4]

     (d)   Outline the importance of timestamping in a data warehouse.                                 [2]

     (e)   Describe how data in a data warehouse is updated in real time.                              [2]

     (f)   Describe the process of deviation detection.                                                [2]

     Data mining techniques are being used in the data warehouse to assist the detection of
     patterns in the health data. The pattern detection approaches being used include cluster
     analysis and association rules.

     (g)   Compare and contrast cluster analysis and association rules as methods of identifying
           patterns in data mining.                                                                    [6]

     (a)            State two variables that are necessary for the mean daily maximum temperature to
                    be calculated.                                                                                   [1]

     (b)            Identify the steps that would be used to create the diagram exactly as shown in
                    Figure 3 using the data in a spreadsheet.                                                        [3]

     (c)            Identify two reasons why the mean daily maximum temperature data is presented in
                    graphical form.                                                                                  [2]

     An automated system is used to collect the temperature data for Nauru once an hour for
     one year.

     (d)            Outline one reason why the temperature data is collected once an hour rather than
                    at shorter intervals, such as once a minute.                                                     [2]

     (e)            Describe the steps that should be used to store the data collected for one day
                    (24 hours) in suitable parallel one-dimensional (1D) arrays.

                    The time the data was collected must be easy to identify. Do not write a
                    pseudocode algorithm.                                                                            [5]

(Option B, question 5 continued)

     The temperature data is downloaded every day and collated into a master file.

     The data from the master file is loaded into a suitable array for that 24-hour period.
     The following statistics are calculated:
     y Maximum temperature
     y Minimum temperature
     y Mean temperature

     As Nauru is very close to the equator, the length of the day changes very little throughout
     the year. For the purposes of part (f), the lengths of its day and night are:
     y Day: 07:00 to 18:59 inclusive (12 hours)
     y Night: 19:00 to 06:59 inclusive (12 hours)

     (f)   Construct a pseudocode algorithm to calculate the:
           y maximum temperature
           y minimum temperature
           y mean temperature
           y mean night-time temperature.

           Assume the arrays for the time of day of the reading and hourly temperature readings
           have already been set up and populated as parallel 1D arrays.                                  [8]

6.   The global increase in mean temperatures is causing concern, and governments are using
     computer models to determine potential future changes.

     Many islands in the Pacific Ocean are close to or below sea level and have observed an
     increased incidence of coastal flooding. This suggests there is a relationship between the
     increase in mean temperatures and the increase in mean sea levels.

     Figure 4 shows the mean sea level of Nauru from 1994 to 2015.

     If the mean sea level rises, the probability of coastal flooding will also increase. This will put
     many of the inhabitants of Nauru at risk.

     It has been proposed that a simulation be developed to show the effects of rising
     temperatures on the extent and frequency of coastal flooding.

7.   Organizations such as Earth.Org have raised concerns about the rate of sea level increase
     for Nauru. They stated, “Sea level rise is 2 to 3 times faster around Nauru than the
     global average, putting its freshwater supplies and crops at risk of saltwater contamination.
     Already reliant on economic aid, Nauru’s basic resource needs may have to be acquired
     externally for life to be sustained on the island.”

     The 2D visualisation in Figure 5 shows the projected impact of mild and extreme sea level
     increases on Nauru by 2100.

8.   Genetic algorithms are based on Darwin’s theory of natural selection. The process selects
     the fittest individuals.

     (a)   Identify three of the phases in a genetic algorithm.                                          [3]

     Developments in machine learning and neural networks have led to simulations that are able
     to beat the leading human players of games. For example, Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov
     in chess, and Alpha Go beat Fan Hui in go (a Chinese strategy board game).

     The neural network used to defeat Fan Hui used the go board (see Figure 6) as an
     input device.

                                        Figure 6: The go board




     Within the neural network there is a policy layer that selects the next move. There is also a
     value network that predicts the winner of the game.

     They often visit websites such as BBC Bitesize.

     Alexia refers to accessing the websites as “surfing the internet” and Jay refers to the
     resources as being “on the web”.

     (a)   Distinguish between the internet and the World Wide Web.                                      [2]

     The uniform resource locator (URL) for the BBC Bitesize website is as follows:

                                 https://www.bbc.co.uk/bytesize/index.htm

     (b)   Identify two characteristics of a URL.                                                        [2]

     Jay wants to transfer a file to Alexia and suggests they use file transfer protocol (FTP).

10.   Alexia and Jay are researching the web development language PHP.

      They type the phrase “PHP” directly into a web browser (see Figure 7).

            Figure 7: “PHP” typed into a web browser and redirected to a search engine

                           https://one2seven.org/search?q=php

                About 12 260 000 000 results (0.36 seconds)



      The web browser redirects them to a popular search engine, which executes a search.

      (a)   Define the term search engine.                                                            [1]

      The operation of a search engine can be divided into three steps (see Figure 8).

                    Figure 8: The three steps in the operation of a search engine


                 Crawling                            Indexing                  Ranking


      (b)   Describe how a web crawler functions.                                                     [2]

      (c)   Outline why keywords are important for web indexing.                                      [2]

      (d)   Discuss whether an organization should use black hat search engine optimization
            (SEO) techniques to improve the ranking of its website.                                   [6]

      Search engines return a very large number of results, but many of the web pages are
      not useful. The search needs to be refined.

      Alexia and Jay’s teacher recommended that they use an online database that accesses
      the deep web.

      (e)   Distinguish between the surface web and the deep web.                                     [2]

             $errors= array();
             $file_name = $_FILES['CV']['name'];
             $file_size =$_FILES['CV']['size'];
             $file_tmp =$_FILES['CV']['tmp_name'];
             $file_type=$_FILES['CV']['type'];

               $file_ext=strtolower(end(explode('.',$_FILES['CV']['name'])));

               $extensions= array("pdf","doc","docx");

               if(in_array($file_ext,$extensions)=== false){

                   move_uploaded_file($file_tmp,"CV/".$file_name);
                   echo "Success";
               }else{
                   print_r($errors);

11.   A social media file-sharing website allows users to upload their original video content.

      The site provides an upload module that uses lossless compression.

      (a)   Outline how lossless compression maintains the quality of a media file.                     [2]

      When a file is decompressed, the content is rendered to fit a standard set of sizes,
      aspect ratios, and frame rates. Standard video formats, such as MP4, are used for
      the output of media.

      The file format MP4 or MPEG-4 is an open standard for media files.

      (b)   Identify two characteristics of an open standard.                                           [2]

      Social media sites use a distributed system where the data is stored in many countries.

      In the European Union, Argentina, and the Philippines the right to be forgotten has
      been established as law. The right to be forgotten means a person has the right to have
      private information removed from databases and applications so it cannot be found in an
      internet search.

      (c)   Discuss the impact of the decentralized web on an individual’s right to privacy.            [6]

      Xero, a small software company, was established in 2006 in Wellington, New Zealand.
      It produced an easy-to-use accountancy service for small to medium enterprises.
      This product was based on the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model and is sold in a
      subscription format all over the world. Customer data is securely stored online as part
      of the subscription cost.

      (d)   Explain how developments in the web have enabled small companies such as Xero
            to have a global reach.                                                                     [6]

            (ii)   Define the term edge.[1]

      (b)   Define the term strongly connected core (SCC).[1]

      Compare the 2000 and 2012 structures in Figure 9. The diameter (relative importance)
      of the SCC has changed.

      In 1980, Robert Metcalfe proposed that the influence or effect of a telecommunications
      network is influenced by the number of connections in that network.

      This can be expressed as a mathematical equation:

                                                           n(n  1)

                                                              2
      Where:
      y n is the number of nodes
      y effect is the number of edges.

      (c)   With reference to the bowtie structure of the web, explain whether Metcalfe’s law
            is a useful measure in determining the connectedness of the web.                           [3]

13.   The evolution of the web has been described as taking place in three stages: its beginnings
      as Web 1.0, the static web; Web 2.0, the “social or read-write” web; and finally Web 3.0,
      the Semantic web.

      (a)   Describe the aims of the Semantic Web.                                                    [2]

      Ontologies are a technology associated with the Semantic Web.

      (b)   Outline two reasons why ontologies rather than folksonomies will enable
            computer systems like search engines to work in cooperation with people.                  [4]

      Connected devices like Amazon’s Alexa or Apple’s HomePod are often described

Option D — Object-oriented programming

14.   A company sells healthcare products. Each product type is associated with a particular brand
      and brand price.

      A system is designed to manage product sales, customers, and suppliers.

      The Product class keeps details of a product. The following shows part of the code for this class:

      public class Product {

           private String prodCode; // eg X123
           Private String prodType; // eg Sunscreen
           private String prodDescription; // about the product
           private Brand prodBrand; // an object of type Brand
           private int prodSale; // number of units sold

           // Constructor
           // code missing for constructor method

           public int getProdSale(){
               return prodSale;

           public Brand getProdBrand(){
               return prodBrand;
           }

           // all accessor and mutator methods are present but not shown

      } // end of Product class

      The Brand class keeps details of a particular brand. The following shows part of the code for
      this class:

      public class Brand {

           private String brandName; // eg Safesun
           private float brandPrice; // price of the product of this brand

           public Brand(String brandName, float brandPrice) {
               this.brandName = brandName;
               this.brandPrice = brandPrice;
