Answer all questions.

9.    An architect uses a single computer for her business. She uses hand-drawn sketches
      to present her ideas to clients and computer-aided design (CAD) software to create
      construction projects, alterations, and redevelopments.

      (a)   (i)	State what is meant by CAD software.                                                  [1]

            (ii)   Outline two benefits for the architect of using CAD software.                        [4]

      The architect often creates large graphic files that are sent via the internet.

      (b)   Explain the need for data compression software in storing and transferring these
            large graphic files.                                                                        [3]

      Data loss can cause downtime, which can force the architect to pause business operations.

      The impact on productivity depends on the amount of data lost as well as the time it takes
      for data recovery.

      (c)   (i)	Describe how the architect could minimize downtime if the disk system on her
                  computer fails.                                                                       [3]

            (ii)   Outline two causes of data loss other than hardware failure.                         [4]


10.   A school has a local area network (LAN) with a central server that stores many files
      containing personal, health, and financial information.

      The LAN is used by the following types of user: network administrators, teachers, students
      and guests.

      (a)   Explain how the different levels of access for the users of this LAN could be implemented. [6]

      (b)   (i)	Suggest one communications link that would provide high-speed internet access
                  for the school.                                                                       [2]

            (ii)   Suggest two measures to protect the school’s LAN from external network
                   security threats.                                                                    [4]

      The school gives students and teachers their own school email account.

      (c)   List three problems that might result from providing email access to all students
            and teachers.                                                                               [3]

11.   Each set of traffic lights in a city is controlled by a separate embedded system.

      (a)   (i)	Describe what is meant by an embedded system.                                              [2]

            (ii)   State two other examples of embedded systems in daily life.                               [2]

      It has been proposed that all the traffic lights in the city should be controlled from a
      central computer.

      (b)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using one central computer to manage
            the city’s traffic light system.                                                                 [4]

      Vehicle counts provide the city’s traffic control centre with information regarding the number
      of vehicles on the city’s roads.

      (c)   List two types of sensor that could be used to collect data on the number of vehicles.           [2]

      (d)   Describe one difference between interrupts and polling.                                          [2]

      The data about traffic and road conditions will be shared with application (app) developers.
      Their apps can provide real-time information about traffic conditions.

      (e)   Explain the benefit for drivers of having access to real-time information about traffic
            and road conditions.                                                                             [3]


12.   (a)	Consider the following recursive function:

            recfn(N)
                if N <= 0
                     then
                          return 0
                     else
                          if N mod 2 = 0
                              then
                                   return recfn(N-1) - N
                              else
                                   return recfn(N-1) + N
                          endif
                endif
            end recfn

            Determine the value of variable X after execution of the following program statement:

                                               X = recfn(5)

            Show all your working.                                                                           [5]

(Question 12 continued)

     (b)   Describe two basic stack operations.                                                     [4]

     The NUMBERS stack stores real numbers. An algorithm should be constructed that will find the
     smallest number and the largest number stored in the NUMBERS stack. After execution of the
     algorithm, only these two numbers should be stored in the NUMBERS stack (see Figure 1).

               Figure 1: Example data stored in the NUMBERS stack before and after
                             execution of the requested algorithm

            The content in the NUMBERS stack             The content in the NUMBERS stack
            before execution of the algorithm.           after execution of the algorithm.

            The number 23.0 is on the top of             The smallest number, –54.9, is on
            the NUMBERS stack.                           the top of the NUMBERS stack.

                           23.0

                          –54.9

                          –12.4

                           67.0                                       –54.9

                           15.2                                         67.0

     (c)   Construct this algorithm in pseudocode.

           You may assume that the NUMBERS stack already contains real numbers.

           You must use the access methods of a stack.                                              [6]




                                                                                             Turn over

13.   A team of four high-school students decided to create a computer program for younger
      students to help them learn to count and recognize whole numbers from 1 to 25.

      A table partially completed with numbers from 1 to 25 is given to a younger student. The table
      consists of five rows and five columns (see Figure 2). The younger student must enter the
      remaining numbers. Each number from 1 to 25 should be entered only once.

                         Figure 2: Example table partially filled with numbers

                                              24     1

                                                     7    14

                                         4     6                22

                                        10                21     3

                                        11          25           9

      Each of the four students is responsible for creating several sub-programs that will be
      included in the program.

      (a)   List three advantages of using sub-programs in this situation.                             [3]

(This question continues on the following page)
                                                  –7–                                           2225 – 6414


(Question 13 continued)

     The sub-program inputInRange() should return a valid input number.

     This will ensure that the younger student’s input is a number in the range 1–25 inclusive.
     If the input number is not in this range, an appropriate message is output. The process will
     be repeated until a valid number is input.

     For example:

     For the sub-program call N = inputInRange(), if the following appears on the screen:

           Enter a number:
            32
           The number is not in the range from 1 to 25. Please try again.
           Enter a number:
            0
           The number is not in the range from 1 to 25. Please try again.
           Enter a number:
            15
           Your number is valid.



     Then the value of N would be 15 after execution.

     (b)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for the sub-program inputInRange().[4]

            because each of the numbers from             because the number 17 is missing
            1 to 25 appears only once.                   and the number 12 appears twice.

     The sub-program isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT) accepts the two-dimensional array MAT
     and outputs an appropriate message to indicate if it has been correctly filled.

     For example:

     If MAT is the two-dimensional array shown in Figure 3a, then isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT)
     should output that the table has been correctly completed.

     If MAT is the two-dimensional array shown in Figure 3b then isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT)
     should output that the table has not been correctly completed.

(Question 13 continued)

          The description of the algorithm for the isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT) sub-program is
          as follows:
          y Initialize a one-dimensional array, FLAGS, with zero (0) values.
          y Visit all elements of the MAT array.
             y Use the number stored in the MAT array to match up the index in the FLAGS array.
             y Assign one (1) to the FLAGS array at that index.

             y If all the elements in the FLAGS array are one (1), output a message saying that the
                 table has been completed correctly; otherwise, output a message saying that the table
                 has not been completed correctly.
