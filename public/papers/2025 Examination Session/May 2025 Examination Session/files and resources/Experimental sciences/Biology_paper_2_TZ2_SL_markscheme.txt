Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Section A and one out of two questions in Section B. Maximum total = 50 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

4.    An alternative answer is indicated by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

5.    An alternative markscheme is indicated under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

6.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

7.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

8.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

9.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in
      the markscheme then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect).

10.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

11.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then
      it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

12.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the markscheme.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

  • Extended response questions for SLP2 carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality of the answer.

  • [1] for quality is to be awarded when:

     • the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
     • the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.

  • It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of the question. Although, the part with the largest
    number of marks is likely to provide the most evidence.

  • Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain [1] for quality (and vice versa).

                                                                                                                                             8
           h. alleles may display codominance / partial dominance / incomplete dominance / valid example;                                   max
           i.   some traits result from multiple alleles / valid example;
           j.   multiple allele inheritance results in continuous variation;
           k. genes carried on the sex chromosomes /X chromosome display sex linkage / valid example;
           l.   genes may be linked on autosomes / display autosomal linkage;
           m. new alleles may arise by mutation;
