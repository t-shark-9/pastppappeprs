Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional. Do
not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
   in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
   rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
   In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
   used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.

2.   Award max [3].
     Award [1] for a reason/example/scenario where VPN is relevant.
     Award[1] for a feature of VPN (encryption, tunnelling, leak protection, data or bandwidth caps,
     zero-logs policy, IP shuffling, kill switch). (Accept either a term/name or a description of a feature.)
     Award[1] for an elaboration.

     Note: The reason/example/scenario, feature and elaboration must work as whole coherent answer.
     The following answers are only examples there could be other appropriate answers.

     Employees may use a VPN to access company’s network/internal resources/databases/ from
     remote location:
     VPN creates a tunnel;
     allowing secure connections and access (based on employees’ roles);

     Users who need a secure/private communication may use VPN;
     VPN encrypts data;
     and prevents hackers from intercepting sensitive information.;

     Users of insecure public Wi-Fi/ safer browsing while on public Wi-Fi;
     logging in on their socials/ purchasing something online/ leaving credentials;
     VPN lets connect to the provider’s servers creating a private tunnel that secures data;

     Users may use a VPN to give themselves more privacy/ anonymity online/ avoid geographical
     limitations;
     IP address is masked so the location of the user is not known;
     So they can visit websites that are restricted by location/ online businesses use geographic
     segmentation which means prices of product that can be bought and sold (books, airline tickets,
     clothes) vary depending on the buyer’s location/ may be essential if a country is likely to block
     internet content from foreign entities, for example, journalists could use a VPN to look like they are
     within that country (Accept any legitimate reason for needing to be unknown) ;

     Use of a VPN during days and times when a lot of people trying to stream content and download files
     at the same time / to avoid congestion (during peak times of internet usage);
     With a VPN user can choose what network their traffic travels on;
     So, VPNs can (sometimes even) increase the internet speed;
                                             –5–                                        2225 – 6417M


VPNs can be used for bypassing network restrictions;
to access certain blocked websites;
VPNs can tunnel around the restrictions;

Internet/social media users (streaming, online gaming, etc.) may use VPN to avoid
tracking/surveillance;
because VPN hides the type of traffic;
and it can prevent the risk of getting frequent advertisements/ the risk of bandwidth throttling (slowing
down) by ISP provider;
                                                   –6–                                      2225 – 6417M

     Fast /cost effective/flexible way of gathering data;
     from large number of users/ surveys can be sent out as offline or online form (for better reach);

     Standardized question formats;
     can yield more reliable data than other methods (interviews, observation, etc.);

     Anonymity/ privacy for respondents;
     can lead to more honest responses;

     Simple to administer (less time consuming than other methods);
     A large amount of data gathered in a short period of time;

     Fast results/ easy to extract quantitative data/ easy to analyse data;
     because all the users are asked the same questions;

     Note: Reward other correct responses.

            Example 1:

            Each user should be assigned a user role (administrator, student, teacher, guest);
            Each user must have a unique username and password;
            Different access levels could be implemented by using password/ authentication
            (PIN/ token/ biometrics/ two-factor authentication (2FA) before accessing a file/ through
            whitelisting/blacklisting devices/ by verifying MAC addresses;
            Users assigned an administrator role have full access to the system/ are allowed to perform
            most operations on the system (such as, add, remove, edit users, groups, domains, manage
            passwords, configure services, etc.);
            Users assigned a teacher role have read-write access to update student grades/ read-only
            access to students’ records/ no access to other teachers’ financial records;
            A user assigned a student role has read access to his reports / no access to other students’
            /teachers’ data;
            A user assigned a guest role has restricted/limited access to certain file/folders/information
            / no access to the files with sensitive or personal data/ users with guest accounts can only read
            from files containing general info/ guest users cannot perform any actions/ guest users can only
            browse the internet);

            Example 2:

            Create a Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) that allows segmentation of different user groups;
            Each VLAN uses strong authentication/ user logins /two-factor authentication;
            Each VLAN can have specific security policies/ rules and restrictions;
            Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) on devices/ define what resources each group of users
            can access/ assign permissions based on user roles (RBAC);
            Administrators have full access to all resources;
            Teachers have access to their personal records/teaching materials/authorized student data;
            Students have access only to their own files/ assignments/ reports / no access to others' data;
            Guests have internet access only/ restricted access through firewall and ACLs / no access to
            sensitive information;
