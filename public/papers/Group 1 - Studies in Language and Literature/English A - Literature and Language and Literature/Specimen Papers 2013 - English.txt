Write a literary commentary on one of the following:

1.

                 The buyers walk the line of our tobacco.
                 Mum tightens her clutch. She whispers, “Here they come.”
                 Dad nonchalantly stands, resting on one leg, like a horse at rest. He looks away, as if the
          buyers are a common, bland species of bird on an otherwise more exciting safari.
      5          Mum hisses, “Try and look hungry, kids.”
                 I suck in my belly as far as possible and open my eyes as wide as they will go, so
          that they will seem hollow and needy. Vanessa sinks her head to her chest and shrinks with
          not-wanting-to-be-here.
                 Mum turns a fierce, fixed, terrifying smile on the buyers. Her look says, “Give us a good
     10   price and you will be rewarded with my love for all time. Please give us a good price. Please.”
          Waves of her anxiety sink down into my belly and churn with the too-greasy excess of my
          recent breakfast.
                 None of us look at the other farmers and their families, who are also hovering with palpably
          jittering nerves over their bales.
     15          The bales are torn open, leaves are pulled up and smelled; the thin-veined crop is rubbed
          between thick fingers (fingers flashing with gold bands, which are among the many things that
          tell the buyers from the farmers: no farmer I know wears rings). A price is scrawled on a ticket.
          Dad waits until the buyers are out of earshot and then whispers to Mum in a soft, warning voice,
          “Steady. Hold it,” in the way he would talk to a fretful animal.
     20          Now Mum, Vanessa and I watch Dad’s hands as he walks the line. If he agrees with the
          price we have been offered for each bale, he hesitates, fingers hovering briefly above the ticket,
          and then walks on, leaving the ticket intact. That tobacco will be taken away to cigarette factories:
          famous, well-travelled Rhodesian burley all the way from our lucky farm.
                 If Dad disagrees with the price the buyer has offered, he tears the ticket. Those bales will
     25   be rewrapped, loaded onto lorries, and brought back to unlucky Robandi. Dad will wait to sell
          them later in the season, when perhaps the buyers will be more hungry for tobacco. Those bales
          will sit in the grading shed, open to the air, where blasts of steam will keep the leaves in a fine
          balance between soft and mouldy. They will anger Dad whenever he sees them. Mum will
          spend hours, until her fingers burn with the sticky yellowing residue of the leaves, resorting and
     30   rebaling the leaves in the superstitious belief that a new presentation might bring a healthier price.
                 If Dad starts tearing tickets and his face becomes folded and deep, we feel ourselves
          become quiet and wishing-we-weren’t-here. But if he is walking quickly over the line of tobacco,
          leaving the tickets pristine, beautiful whole rectangles of yellow, we are giddy. Vanessa and
          I start to run between the bales, exuberant, silly, loud, and Mum doesn’t say, “Shhh girls!
     35   Behave yourselves!” And then Dad has walked the line and, without looking at the other farmers,
          he takes Mum by the hand and he says, “Come on, Tub.” Vanessa and I fall into line behind Mum
          and Dad. His fingers are wrapped round hers. By the end of today Dad will have gone to see the
          fat man with the wet lips from Tabex and Mum will have her rings back, and when we get home to
          Robandi she will polish them in Silvo to remove the tarnish of shame and disuse.
     40          Dad doesn’t smile, or concede any kind of victory in front of the buyers. He waits until we
          are in the car and then he says to Mum, “Fair price.”

                                July Man

          Old, rain-wrinkled, time-soiled, city-wise, morning man
          whose weeping is for the dust of the elm-flowers
          and the hurting motes of time,
          rotted with rotting grape,
      5   sweet with the fumes,
          puzzled for good by fermented potato-
          peel out of the vat of the times,
          turned out and left
          in this grass-patch, this city-gardener’s place
     10   under the buzzing populace’s
          square shadows, and the green shadows
          of elm and ginkgo and lime
          (planted for Sunday strollers and summer evening
          families, and for those
     15   bird-cranks with bread-crumbs
          and crumpled umbrellas who come
          while the dew is wet on the park, and beauty
          is fan-tailed, grey and dove grey, aslant, folding in
          from the white fury of day).

     20   In the sound of the fountain
          you rest, at the cinder-rim, on your bench.

          The rushing river of cars
          makes you a stillness, a pivot, a heart-stopping
          blurt, in the sorrow
     25   of the last rubbydub swig, the searing, and
          stone-jar solitude lost, and yet,
          and still – wonder (for good now) and
          trembling:

                The too much none of us knows
     30         is weight, sudden sunlight, falling
                on your hands and arms, in your lap,
                all, all, in time.

                                                 Margaret Avison, The Dumbfounding (1966),

Drama

1.   Explore the ways in which dramatists have made use of monologues and/or soliloquies in at least two
     plays you have studied.


2.   Plays employ various kinds of structural divisions such as prologues and epilogues, act and scene
     divisions, even carefully placed intermissions. Discuss the dramatic uses made of these divisions in
     at least two plays you have studied.


3.   “A play should make you laugh or should make you cry.” With reference to at least two plays you
     have studied, discuss the methods playwrights use to generate emotional response in their audiences.



Poetry

4.   A poem on the page is often recognized immediately by its visual appearance. Using at least two
     poems you have studied, discuss the way the poets have arranged lines and stanzas in terms of length,
     spacing or position to create visual arrangements that mirror the thoughts and feelings of the poems.


5.   Focussing on the works of at least two poets you have studied, discuss the effects created by
     metaphors in a poem.


6.   Light and dark, country and city, proud and humble—these and numerous other contrasts have been
     used by poets to sharpen their expression of ideas or feelings. In the works of at least two poets you
     have studied, explore the ways contrasts have been used to achieve particular effects.

7.    Writers of fiction do not always relate events in chronological order. In at least two works you
      have studied, explore the effects of telling the story in a non-chronological manner.


8.    The memorable impact of novels and short stories arises from the careful and often brilliant
      creation of detail by their writers. Using at least two writers you have studied, explore the role and
      impact of some significant details in the narratives.


9.    Some writers select a narrative voice that sharpens or clarifies their stories; others choose a narrative
      voice that mystifies or misleads. How and to what effect have at least two of the writers you have
      studied employed narrative voice?



Prose other than fiction

10.   Choosing at least two works you have studied, discuss the way the writers have structured their
      works to make their material clear and interesting to their audiences.

      discuss the use made of the interplay between personal history and the background within which
      that personal history occurred.

     Examiners: please note that the term “comparison”, both in the descriptors and in the

Drama

1.      An adequate to good answer will select some significant monologues and/or soliloquies from
        at least two plays and compare the ways in which these speeches are used by the dramatists.

        A good to excellent answer may offer closer scrutiny of the selected monologues and/or
        soliloquies, examining closely various ways in which dramatists use such speeches to
        impact their dramas as a whole and offering a closer analysis of the uniqueness of each
        dramatist’s approach.


2.      An adequate to good answer will identify appropriate conventions that separate aspects of
        at least two plays and will compare some of the ways in which these divisions affect the
        dramatic presentation of the plays.

        A good to excellent answer may offer more specific detail regarding the types of divisions
        that occur in the plays and distinguish more closely how the choices of each dramatist lead to
        the effectiveness of particular aspects of the drama.


3.      An adequate to good answer will identify some methods by which at least two dramatists
        generate emotional responses and offer supportive detail for how such methods work,
        comparing the choice of methods employed by the dramatists and/or the outcomes achieved.

        A good to excellent answer may offer a more in-depth and detailed discussion of the
        methods employed by dramatists to generate emotion, clearly evaluating the uniqueness of
        generating emotion in the separate dramas, and offering, perhaps, a distinction between
        comedy and tragedy.

Poetry

4.   An adequate to good answer will identify the visual and structural features of at least two
     poems (by two poets) and offer an analysis of the relationship of such features to the thoughts
     and feelings expressed in the poems, comparing the approaches of the poets in this regard.

     A good to excellent answer may provide greater insight into the visual arrangement and
     structural features of the poems, evaluating closely the varying effects of these features on the
     “mirroring” of thought and feeling, clearly discerning the subtleties of the approaches as seen
     in the separate poems.


5.   An adequate to good answer will identify some significant metaphors in at least two poems
     (by two poets) and discuss the effects of these metaphors, offering points of comparison on
     the use of metaphor in these poems.

     A good to excellent answer may offer carefully selected examples of metaphor and a close
     analysis of their effects, showing a clear understanding of the uniqueness of the use of
     metaphor from poem to poem.


6.   An adequate to good answer will identify some important contrasts in at least two poems
     (by two poets) and discuss the ways in which these contrasts have been used to sharpen ideas,
     feelings, or for some other effect, offering some comparison of the contrasts chosen and/or the
     effects achieved.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more considered discussion of the kinds (e.g. image
     patterns, settings, characterizations, etc.) of contrasts used, clearly comparing how these
     contrasts operate to achieve a particular effect.

Prose: novel and short story

7.   An adequate to good answer will accurately identify the narrative line of at least two works of
     fiction (by two writers) and compare the effects of the writers shifting the chronology of
     events in some way.

     A good to excellent answer may discuss in greater detail the deviations from chronology and
     how they are achieved and offer a more in-depth discussion of the effects of such shifting,
     showing a clear awareness of how such authorial decisions add to the effectiveness of the
     individual work.


8.   An adequate to good answer will choose some significant details from at least two works
     of fiction (by two writers) and compare the role and impact of these details in the
     individual works.

     A good to excellent answer may show a more sophisticated sense of the ways in which
     details are incorporated into literary works and offer a more in-depth comparison of the role
     and impact of detail in the individual works, perhaps assessing how such detail makes a
     work memorable.


9.   An adequate to good answer will identify the narrative voice in at least two works of fiction
     (by two writers) and compare how these narrators are used by the individual writers and to
     what effect.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more detailed analysis of the narrative voice and offer
     a more thoughtful understanding of how the choice of narrator affects the reader’s reception
     of the text, perhaps as to clarity or confusion, clearly distinguishing the impact of narrative
     voice from one text to the next.

Prose other than fiction

10.   An adequate to good answer will identify some structural features of at least two works
      (by two writers) and compare the effectiveness with which these features help convey the
      content in a clear and interesting fashion.

      A good to excellent answer may offer some telling comparisons between the structuring of the
      works and the effects these structures have on clarity and interest.


11.   An adequate to good answer will address, in at least two works (by two writers), personal
      history and the larger context of the work and discuss the degree to which these two are
      effectively combined, drawing some comparison from one work to the next.

      A good to excellent answer may offer a more in-depth discussion, comparing how the writers
      have moved between these two realms, perhaps, to achieve a larger artistic effect.


12.   An adequate to good answer will identify particular places or settings in at least two works

                                        Ballad of Birmingham

                          (On the Bombing of a Church in Birmingham, Alabama, 1963)

                          “Mother dear, may I go downtown
                          Instead of out to play,
                          And march the streets of Birmingham
                          In a Freedom March today?”

                      5   “No, baby, no, you may not go,
                          For the dogs are fierce and wild,
                          And clubs and hoses, guns and jail
                          Aren’t good for a little child.”

                          “But, mother, I won’t be alone.
                    10    Other children will go with me,
                          And march the streets of Birmingham
                          To make our country free.”

                          “No, baby, no, you may not go,
                          For I fear those guns will fire.
                    15    But you may go to church instead
                          And sing in the children’s choir.”

                          She has combed and brushed her night-dark hair,
                          And bathed rose petal sweet,
                          And drawn white gloves on her small brown hands,
                    20    And white shoes on her feet.

                          The mother smiled to know her child
                          Was in the sacred place,
                          But that smile was the last smile
                          To come upon her face.

                    25    For when she heard the explosion,
                          Her eyes grew wet and wild.
                          She raced through the streets of Birmingham
                          Calling for her child.

                     She clawed through bits of glass and brick,
               30    Then lifted out a shoe.
                     “O, here’s the shoe my baby wore,
                     But, baby, where are you?”

                   Herby Chin kept calling for his mother, until finally I heard the back door open and a
             rush of footsteps and voices from the kitchen; a chair fell over, curtains were whipped back,
             blinds whirled and snapped up. Mr. Chin was shouting instructions. Mrs. Chin called my name.
             Shadows moved, and bodies, tall and short, shuddered around the room. At the doorway of the
      5      bedroom, when she saw me look up at her, Mrs. Chin only hesitated for a second before she
             rushed beside the bed, shoved aside some pillows and clothes, and warily knelt beside me on
             the mattress: “Don’t be afraid … don’t be afraid …” I felt Mommy’s head move.
                   Mrs. Chin, with her strong farming hands, pulled apart the rigid arms and began lifting me
             up, up, up, from the dark between my mother’s breasts. Wetness clung to my legs. Sheets of
     10      wetness pulled away from me.
                   I was carried away at last, carried into the late morning air to the Chins’ heated cabin.
             Mrs. Chin told me again not to be afraid, put me down in a large chair in the midst of her own four
             children sitting around the table. Their small faces reflected back to me my own vacant stare.
                   “Now we have some jook,” Mrs. Chin said, as calmly as she could manage, putting a bowl
     15      of morning gruel in front of me.
                   They told me later that I ate, that I said nothing. I remember hearing the siren of the
             police car, Mrs. Chin scrubbing her hands furiously; and when night fell, Mr. Chin sat beside
             me and told all his four children and myself a story of Old China. There were many words I
             did not understand, phrases whose meanings were riddles. In the kerosene lamplight, he recited
     20      poetry and sang old songs, and slapped his overalls till the dust from his day’s labour settled
             over everyone. I remember the joy and excitement of his storytelling, and the quickening of
             my heart when he asked me what I would like.

                   “Tell another story!” I said, and knew suddenly, another’s voice, my mommy’s voice with
             its Hoiping tones, would never say again “Long time ago … in Old China …”
     25            Mrs. Chin passed some pie a neighbour had brought by. The pie was freshly baked and
             steaming, and smelled of apples and cinnamon. It was made by a white lady named Mrs. Lawrence.
             She had white hair and wore glasses and had a kind face. She poked her head in and asked,
             “How is the little boy doing?”
                   “Good,” Mrs. Chin said. “Jung strong boy. Never cry.”

Text 1




              F     rom a blind overlooking the wetlands of central Wisconsin, I can see a long-legged
         bird in the distance, a stroke of white curled at the top, like a bright question mark against the
         emerald green grasses. Then up pops another from the screen of reeds. The birds are yearlings,
         five feet tall, with snow-white plumage and elegant black wing tips that spread like fingers when
    5    they fly. They’re quiet now, but from the long trachea coiled in their breastbones may come a wild,
         singing whoop, harsh and thrilling, that gives their tribe its name.
                This would be a primordial scene—big sky, undulations of tall marsh grasses, wild whooping
         cranes—were it not for a penned area nearby, where several whooper chicks, well camouflaged
         in tawny feathers, forage in the shallows. In a whisper, crane biologist Richard Urbanek explains
   10    that these chicks have been raised in captivity but have never heard a human voice nor seen a
         human form, except in crane costume. As part of an experimental program to reintroduce a wild
         migratory population of whooping cranes to the eastern half of North America, these chicks have
         been fed and tended by crane-costumed people for two months. Now, before they are released to
         the wild, they are being taught the habits of their ancestors with modern techniques pioneered by
   15    Operation Migration, an organization devoted to helping endangered birds learn their traditional
         migratory routes. Near the pen is a long stretch of open grass, a runway, where the chicks are
         learning to fly behind an ultralight plane flown by a pilot in crane costume who will guide them
         from this refuge 1,200 miles south across seven states to wintering grounds in Florida.
                                                –3–                 SPEC/1/A2ENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

           Two cohorts have already made such trips—and returned on their own, the first whooping
20   cranes in perhaps more than a century to fly freely over the eastern United States. After three years
     of ultralight-led migrations, the new eastern migratory population numbers 36 birds, including
     the yearlings and the chicks. The success of this effort is leading the way for a more ambitious
     project half a world away in the northern reaches of Russia. In the fall of next year an international
     team plans to lead a flock of young captive-bred Siberian cranes along part of their traditional
25   migratory route, from Russia to Iran, to restore the birds’ knowledge of the ancient flyway—not
     with ultralights but with hang gliders that will soar a difficult path extending more than 3,000 miles
     over four different countries.



       Hang glider pilot Angelo d’Arrigo leads a trio of young captive-bred Siberian cranes on a trial
                           flight over the Arctic Circle in Siberia—part of an ambitious effort to teach
30                                                     the endangered birds the migration route of their

                                                   To a Waterfowl

                                          WHITHER, midst falling dew,
                                   While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
                                   Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
                                          Thy solitary way?

                               5         Vainly the fowler’s* eye
                                   Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
                                   As, darkly seen against the crimson sky,
                                         Thy figure floats along.

                                        Seek’st thou the plashy brink
                              10   Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
                                   Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
                                        On the chafed ocean side?

                                        There is a Power whose care
                                   Teaches thy way along that pathless coast –
                              15   The desert and illimitable air –
                                        Lone wandering, but not lost.

                                         All day thy wings have fanned,
                                   At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere,
                                   Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
                              20         Though the dark night is near.

                                        And soon that toil shall end;
                                   Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
                                   And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,
                                        Soon, o’er thy sheltered nest.

                              25        Thou’rt gone, the abyss of heaven
                                   Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart
                                   Deeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given,
                                        And shall not soon depart.

                                         He who, from zone to zone,
                              30   Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
                                   In the long way that I must tread alone,
                                         Will lead my steps aright.

                                                                  William Cullen Bryant, To a Waterfowl (1815)

Text 4

                During my mother’s labour, my father was in his study, praying for a safe and
         speedy delivery. Nanny rushed in with the news and was given the traditional tip—a gold sovereign.
         Later, when the room had been tidied and Mother put to bed, he came in to see her. My parents
         had already three children, two boys and a girl. When the boys were born, Father congratulated
    5    Mother with a quotation from Firdowsi’s The Book of Kings:
         		           “Sufficient unto women is the art of
         		           Producing and raising sons as brave as lions”
                My sister was a welcome variety, and “such a pretty little girl”. I just happened.
                Would Father have preferred a boy, as men always did in those days? I once asked him:
   10    “Not because boys are better, but because women suffer more. One worries about their future;
         one wonders into whose hand they will fall …”
                I was born into a new and rapidly changing Persia. The veil had already been abolished
         and women were emancipated; they could go to school and university and take up professions.
         By the time I grew up, other freedoms and equalities were taken for granted and more reforms were
   15    planned to balance the law in their favour. Yet many found it hard to accept these improvements
         and adjust their attitudes.
                “God knows how far women will go once they start enjoying their liberty” was the reason for
         apprehension. Certainly I caused my parents endless trouble, with my radical adolescent politics,
         my settling in Europe and subsequent marriage to an Englishman. Perhaps my father foresaw
   20    all this at the time of my birth; perhaps it was all “written on my brow”? Ah, that writing on
         the brow! They said that, when a baby was born, an angel wrote its destiny on its forehead with an
         invisible ink, and that nothing anyone later did could alter it.
                Fortune-telling charlatans played on this belief and claimed that they could read what was
         inscribed “on the brow” and change it with potions and talismans. As a philosopher, my father was
   25    no Determinist, and did not believe in any of this superstition; nothing was “written” and no one
         could foretell the future since we make it as we go along. Naturally, such factors as heredity and
         circumstance play a part, but basically we shape our own destinies. […]
                Over the years, scholars and mystics came to see my father from all over the world,
         among them a famous Indian yogi, when I was a year old. Apparently he did have an extraordinary
   30    power to foresee the future, for he gave a broad outline of every member of our family’s destiny.
         When my turn came he shook his head and said:
                “She won’t stay with you long … her life is elsewhere.”
                My mother laughed incredulously:
                “Oh yes, she’ll marry the Governor of a Province or an Ambassador and travel …”
   35           The Yogi smiled and said no more. Perhaps it is all “written” after all!

 These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered
 as an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must
 rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded
 as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested
 here should not be so heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.


                                           SECTION A

This question asks candidates to compare an extract of an article, “Cranes” by
Jennifer Ackerman/National Geographic Stock to the poem “To a Waterfowl,” 1815, by William
Cullen Bryant, both of which discuss waterfowl.

An adequate to good analysis will:

  comment on commonalities between the two passages, such as the focus on waterfowl,
  the emphasis on teaching or guidance, the emphasis on the immediate environment and
  its significance
  comment on the different text types, noting some characteristics of each (such as, form/structure,
  illustration, imagery, sound and comparative devices) and the differing effects these devices
  have on the reader
  comment on the differences of context and intent as deduced from the times in which the texts
  were written, and issues and references made within the texts themselves (the somewhat archaic
  language of the poem – “thou” and “thy”, “fowler”, and its formal structure and didactic and
  moral assurance as opposed to the more casual and informative prose of the contemporary article
  with references to “hang gliders” and “ultralight planes” and “endangered species”)
  comment on the differing roles of the first person narrative voices, noting the differing
  perceptions of humans, a “higher power”, and nature.


A good to excellent analysis may also:

  explore differences in tone and draw some conclusions as to how tone conveys contexts of time
  and place
  explore in greater depth the writing techniques and their effects, examining more closely
  elements of style and their reflection of the writer’s intent and the impact on the reader
  explore in greater depth the suitability of text type to purpose and content, examining closely the
  features of each text type and their effects
  offer a cogent comparison that ties together the pairing of the two text types.

                                           SECTION B

This question asks candidates to compare a cartoon CATHY © 1986 Cathy Guisewite, reprinted
with permission of UNIVERSAL UCLICK, to a passage from a memoir by Shusha Guppy, The
Blindfold Horse, Memories of a Persian Childhood, I. B. Tauris and Co. Ltd. (1988) both of which
explore gender stereotypes.

An adequate to good analysis will:

  comment on commonalities between the two texts, such as the female point of view, the focus on
  gender identification, stereotyping beginning at birth, shifting attitudes towards women and
  the implications of destiny
  comment on the different text types, exploring some characteristics of each (the cartoon elements
  such as the four block narrative, humour, irony, setting, dialogue, drawings, choice of language,
  fonts, punctuation, etc. and the memoir elements such as first person narrative,
  retrospect/reflection, setting, style, exemplification/explanation, embedded dialogue, etc.) and
  the differing effects these devices have on the reader
  comment on the shaping of identity as explored variously in these two texts
  comment on the differences of context and intent as deduced from the texts themselves, noting,
  perhaps, that though written at roughly the same time, the two texts explore different cultures, as
  seen through the settings and points of view. Consideration of the generic as opposed to the
  personal and the relevance of technique to intended audience might be explored.


A good to excellent analysis may also:

  explore differences in tone and draw some conclusions as to how tone conveys contexts of time
  and place
  explore in greater depth and detail the effects of the techniques of the two text types
  explore in greater depth and detail the relationship between text type and purpose and content
  offer a cogent comparison between the two text types that offers clear understanding of intent,
  context, content and audience.

Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you have
studied. Answers which are not based on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score high
marks. Your answer should address the ways in which language, context and structure contribute to your
reading of each work.

1.   Analyse how justice is represented and understood in at least two works studied.


2.   Writers often use a character who is alienated from his or her culture or society in order to explore
     cultural or social values. Examine this idea with reference to at least two works studied.


3.   What impact does setting have on your understanding of the central ideas or themes presented in
     at least two works studied?


4.   Literature is often said to be timeless. To what extent is this true of at least two works you
     have studied?


5.   It has been said that history “cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.”
     To what extent do at least two works studied “face” history in order to ensure that its wrongs “need not be
     lived again”?


6.   Looking closely at at least two works studied, show that more than one interpretation could be made of
     those works.

  Context should be understood in the widest possible sense. It may include the social and/or
  historical setting of the work; it may include the context of a situation within the work and will
  certainly include contexts of production and reception of a work.

  In addition to the notes below, responses should be structured with a logical sequence and
  development. Clear, varied and accurate language should be used, as well as appropriate register,
  style and terminology.

1.    An adequate to good answer will identify justice as it is presented in the works and in relation
      to context. It will support that identification with textual examples. The answer will also
      address the significance of justice in the works and the methods by which that significance is
      achieved.

      A good to excellent answer may offer a more nuanced understanding of the idea of justice
      presented in the works, perhaps noting that the writers’ attitudes towards justice conflict with
      the attitudes of the societies being presented in the works, thus demonstrating an
      understanding of context. Answers will offer a clear understanding of the significance of
      justice and how it is presented. Examples chosen will be precise and pertinent.


2.    An adequate to good answer will identify alienated character(s) in the works and will draw on
      examples to consider how these character(s) are used to address the values of the social and/or
      cultural contexts within the works. An understanding of the relationship between alienation
      and social/cultural values will be established.

      A good to excellent answer may identify alienated character(s) and will draw on effective
      examples to offer a persuasive analysis of the way that these characters are used to address
      cultural or social values. Consideration may be given to varying ways in which the cultural or
      social contexts can be understood and the relevance of alienation to those understandings.


3.    An adequate to good answer will offer examples to show that the settings of the
      works establish contexts which influence the reader’s understanding of the ideas/themes of
      the works. An understanding of the impact of setting will be demonstrated.

      A good to excellent answer may offer effective examples to show a clear awareness of the
      issues of setting, whether time or place, as a context for the development and understanding of
      ideas/themes. A more sophisticated understanding of the impact of setting will be generated.


4.    An adequate to good answer will consider aspects of “literature” (probably characterization
      and theme) evident in the works studied and offer examples to support whether or not these
      aspects will enable the works to survive the changing contexts of time.

      A good to excellent answer may examine more closely various aspects of “literature”
      (including perhaps, writing style, literary traditions, genre type) in the works studied and will
      decide to what degree these aspects will enable works to withstand the contexts of time,
      offering, perhaps, a more nuanced response in that some aspects will be hindered by changing
      contexts and others will not.

5.   An adequate to good answer will offer examples to show how the works studied establish a
     context through which to “face”, challenge or revisit history in order to address past wrongs.

     A good to excellent answer may effectively discuss how the works shape context so as to
     confront history and will analyse the effectiveness of that confrontation. Consideration may
     be given to the element of “courage” and the extent to which literature is a useful form
     of redress.


6.   An adequate to good answer will select aspects/moments/examples in the works studied and
     explore how these elements might lead to varying interpretations of the works.
     Understanding of the impact of context and stylistic features on interpretation will also
     be demonstrated.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a detailed analysis of specific elements in the works
     studied and effectively demonstrate how more than one interpretation could be made of
     the works. A more nuanced understanding of the impact of context and stylistic features on
     interpretation will also be demonstrated.

                                   THE   PRINCE OF TIDES
         “I’ve always had a fatalistic attitude to life… never store it up, because you
         never know what’s going to happen tomorrow. Anything can happen at
         any time” – Saif Ali Khan
         Unfettered in spirit, unpredictable in act, Saif Ali Khan undoubtedly is Bollywood’s most
    5    unplanned success story in its super league of stars. When this Khan came into the film industry
         at the threshold of the 1990s with three other Khans – Aamir, Salman and Shah Rukh – raring to
         rewrite Bollywood history with their cultivated strive, strife and style, Saif’s natural recklessness
         almost became his nemesis. Two decades on, he has survived to become the ultimate cool dude,
         with that very signature unpredictability now making him an “in-sync-with-his-times” youth icon.
   10           In his youthful
         and profligate1 20s,
         he was ignored as the
         “man with the funny
         face.” Mature and
   15    stepping into his 40s,
         he’s made playing
         funny       on-screen,
         worthy of a serious
         hero’s      showcase.
   20    He has emerged a
         definitive performing
         lead star for cerebral
         comedies and a
         dependable anchor
   25    for      contemporary
         satire, helmed by2
         the       experimental
         and different Gen X3
         storytellers.
   30    […]
                 Call it courtesy his non-strategised career choices or simple laidback attitude; it would
         indeed be hard to identify any mainstream heroine with whom Saif hasn’t shared the creative
         space or any leading hero he didn’t play second fiddle to. “In the beginning of my career I was just
         having fun. Then I got married, had kids and settled. I wasn’t even trying to grow. It took me a
   35    long time to learn. I was lucky to have been given that chance. It’s only in the last few years that
         I have started enjoying this film business from my heart,” Saif had recently remarked.
         […]
                                                                  –3–                      SPEC/1/A2ENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

                   Saif’s half-confidence, his ambivalence and mixed palette of roles have only broadened his
            appeal and casting. Starting a distant last, struggling in ensembles when the trio boasted of solo
    40      blockbusters in their kitty4, today Saif is as good as any other Khan, or for that matter any superstar,
            if not better – constantly experimenting, reinventing and breaking new ground. The challenge now
            lies in how he steers clear of the demons of smugness that tend to so seamlessly corrupt good
            actors often losing themselves to the trappings of superstardom. Now that he has tasted blood,
            he is raring to go as never before, diversifying into production and trying new acting parts like
    45      an unusual double role in his last superhit film Love Aaj Kal. But he shouldn’t repeat himself
            or short change his following. A Tashan or Thoda Pyar Thoda Magic could be seen as possible
            shifts towards complacency, going easy again. The catch is to remain imperfect, remain humane,
            remain vulnerable, remain unsatisfied, remain unpredictable – remain Saif.
                   Perfection isn’t always the most cherished attribute for superstardom. That’s the moral of
    50      the Saif success story.

                  You ask me what is poverty? Listen to me. Here I am, dirty, smelly, and with no “proper”
           underwear on and with the stench of my rotting teeth near you. I will tell you. Listen to me.
           Listen without pity. I cannot use your pity. Listen with understanding. Put yourself in my dirty,
           worn out, ill-fitting shoes, and hear me.
      5           Poverty is getting up every morning from a dirt- and illness-stained mattress.
           The sheets have long since been used for diapers. Poverty is living in a smell that never leaves.
           This is a smell of urine, sour milk and spoiling food sometimes joined with the strong smell of
           long-cooked onions. […] It is the smell of the mattresses where years of “accidents” have happened.
           It is the smell of milk which has gone sour because the refrigerator long has not worked,
    10     and it costs money to get it fixed. It is the smell of rotting garbage. I could bury it, but where is
           the shovel? Shovels cost money. […]
                  Poverty is dirt. You can say in your clean clothes coming from your clean house,
           “Anybody can be clean.” Let me explain about housekeeping with no money. For breakfast I
           give my children grits1 with no oleo2 or cornbread without eggs and oleo. This does not use up
    15     many dishes. What dishes there are, I wash in cold water with no soap. Even the cheapest soap
           has to be saved for the baby’s diapers. Look at my hands, so cracked and red. Once I saved
           for two months to buy a jar of Vaseline for my hands and the baby’s diaper rash. When I had
           saved enough, I went to buy it and the price had gone up two cents. The baby and I suffered on.
           […]
    20            Poverty is staying up all night on cold nights to watch the fire knowing one spark on
           the newspapers covering the walls means your sleeping child dies in flames. In summer,
           poverty is watching gnats and flies devour your baby’s tears when he cries. The screens are torn
           and you pay so little rent you know they will never be fixed. Poverty means insects in your food,
           in your nose, in your eyes, and crawling over you when you sleep. Poverty is hoping it never rains
    25     because diapers won’t dry when it rains and soon you are using newspapers. Poverty is seeing
           your children forever with runny noses. Paper handkerchiefs cost money and all your rags you
           need for other things. Even more costly are antihistamines. Poverty is cooking without food and
           cleaning without soap.
                  Poverty is asking for help. Have you ever had to ask for help, knowing your children will
    30     suffer unless you get it? Think about asking for a loan from a relative, if this is the only way you
           can imagine asking for help. I will tell you how it feels. You find out where the office is that
           you are supposed to visit. You circle that block four or five times. Thinking of your children,
           you go in. Everyone is very busy. Finally, someone comes out and you tell her that you need help.
           That never is the person that you need to see. You go see another person, and after spilling the
    35     whole shame of your poverty all over the desk between you, you find that this isn’t the right office
           after all – you must repeat the whole process, and it never is any easier at the next place. […]
                  I have come out of my despair to tell you this. Remember I did not come from another place
           or another time. Others like me are all around you. Look at us with an angry heart, anger that will
           help you help me.
                    From the essay “What is poverty?” by Jo Goodwin Parker, in America’s Other Children:
                Public Schools Outside Suburbia by George Henderson, 1971, University of Oklahoma Press
                                                                                Reprinted by permission.

This question asks candidates to comment on a magazine article, “The Prince of Tides”,
from Stardust Icon, Issue 6 (2010).

An adequate to good analysis will:

• comment on the intended audience as readers of movie star magazines, and, in particular, fans of
  Saif Ali Khan
• comment on contextual elements such as time, place and content
• comment on the picture and the large font quotation from Saif as a means to grab the reader’s
  attention
• comment on the casual nature of the language (“raring to”, “cool dude”, “their kitty”,
  “tasted blood”, “the catch”, etc.), the comparisons of Saif to the three other Khans, the contrasts
  of past to present, the use of quotations, rhetorical devices such as repetitions of words and
  sounds, the various font changes, and the relevance of all such observations to the text type.
• comment on the relevance of the title and its font type, perhaps seeing the “in and out” and
  “up and down” nature of Saif’s career
• comment on the narrative voice, perhaps noting the sense of “critical flair”, the personal advice,
  the sense of a voice directly addressing the reader.


A good to very good analysis will also:

• explore more closely how the text satisfies the desires of the intended audience
• explore the language, style, and format more carefully and with greater sophistication, perhaps
  noting the play on contradicting elements (“funny face”/“serious hero”, “anchor”/“helm”, etc.),
  the use of mixed metaphors (“steers clear of demons…that…seamlessly corrupt”),
  the juxtaposition of casual and sophisticated language, the use of parallel sentence structures,
  opening and closing the article with “success story”, the impact of formatting on the reader, etc.
• consider the photograph in terms of the verbal picture given of Saif in the article
• offer a closer look at contextual elements and how they characterize this text type
• consider the narrative voice more closely, perhaps noting the narrator’s shifts in style and tone,
  his willingness to “define” Saif, to critique his recent films, and to offer a moral to the story, etc.,
  showing an opinionated voice
• consider the title more closely, seeing, perhaps, its reflection not only in the subject of the piece
  but in the style of the article itself, in the “in’s and out’s” of the presentation (the somewhat
  precarious balance between praise and criticism) and the nautical language.

Text 2

This question asks candidates to comment on an excerpt from an essay about poverty by
Jo Goodwin Parker (1971).

An adequate to good analysis will:

  comment on the use of first person and second person, noting the direct address to the reader
  recognize that the reader is addressed as a listener
  recognize that the essay is represented as the speaker’s response to a question asked by the
  reader/listener (“You ask me what is poverty? Listen to me.”)
  comment on the use of sensory details, perhaps considering how they work to put the
  reader/listener in the speaker’s “dirty, worn out, ill-fitting shoes”
  note key stylistic features, including, for example, the use of questions, repetition, parallel
  sentences (“Poverty is …”), and figurative language (“Put yourself in my … shoes” and “spilling
  the whole shame of your poverty”)
  comment on the use of directives (“Listen to me”).


A good to very good analysis will also:

  make effective comments on the use of first and second person and consider the effects of
  directly addressing the reader
  recognize that “you” refers both to the reader (“I will tell you”) and to the poor person (“you pay
  so little rent”), perhaps noting that one effect of this shift or double meaning is that it puts the
  reader in the speaker’s “dirty, worn out, ill-fitting shoes”
  discuss the effects of key stylistic elements
  recognize that sensory details in the introductory paragraph evoke a close (uncomfortable?)
  proximity between the speaker and the reader/listener (“Here I am, dirty, … with the stench of
  my rotting teeth near you”)
  note that the essay describes the difficulties of “asking for help” but that it does just that (“help
  you help me”)
  consider possible resonances of the statement, “remember I did not come from another place or
  another time,” perhaps noting that the essay was published 40 years ago and that some of its
  references (see footnotes) suggest that the speaker is from the southern USA, or noting that
  poverty is universal but that its consequences are (or are not) felt differently in different places.

Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on both of the Part 3 works you have studied.
Answers which are not based on a discussion of both Part 3 works will not score high marks. Your answer
should address the ways in which language, context and structure contribute to your reading of each work.

1.   Analyse how justice is represented and understood in the two works studied.


2.   Writers often use a character who is alienated from his or her culture or society in order to explore
     cultural or social values. Examine this idea with reference to the two works studied.


3.   What impact does setting have on your understanding of the central ideas or themes presented in the
     two works studied?


4.   Literature is often said to be timeless. To what extent is this true of the two works you have studied?


5.   It has been said that history “cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again”.
     To what extent do the two works studied “face” history in order to ensure that its wrongs “need not be
     lived again”?


6.   Looking closely at the two works studied, show that more than one interpretation could be made of
     those works.
