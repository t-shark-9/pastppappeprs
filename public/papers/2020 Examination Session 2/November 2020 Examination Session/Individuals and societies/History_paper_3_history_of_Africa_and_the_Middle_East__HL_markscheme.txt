Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed
but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or
significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks
allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be
rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   “Economic development was the most significant aspect of the first century of ‘Abbasid rule.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that economic development was
     the most significant aspect of the first century of ‘Abbasid rule. The discussion may extend beyond
     the timeframe, but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
     increases in agricultural and industrial production, the growth of urban areas, increased standards of
     living and expanded foreign trade. Trade routes were opened to the Far East which enlarged both
     the Empire and the Islamic world. Economic development made possible the emergence of new
     social classes and supported scholarship in religious and secular areas. Other relevant factors may
     be addressed, for example the intellectual developments of the Golden Age, the creation of the ruling
     structure and the establishment of effective communications throughout the Empire, which expanded
     trade, exploration, scholarship and religious study. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by relevant evidence.


2.   Examine the role of religion in the maintenance of ‘Abbasid rule.

     Candidates will consider the interrelationship between religion and the maintenance of ‘Abbasid rule.
     Reasons and results may predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the role of religion in the ‘Abbasid rise to
     power. Caliphs retained popular support by emphasizing the religious nature of the dynasty and
     support from religious leaders. Caliphs justified their power by claiming their possession of divine
     right to rule. Islam helped unite a large and ethnically diverse Empire. Other relevant factors may be
     considered, for example the role of religion in weakening ‘Abbasid power. The growth of religious
     dissent undermined ‘Abbasid rule as the Fatimids used their views to create powerful opposition.
     The tension between Sunni and Shi’a followers was a source of conflict and division. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                   N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   To what extent did divisions within the Fatimid Empire weaken their claim to the caliphate?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that divisions within the
     Fatimid Empire weakened their claim to the caliphate. Reasons may predate the timeframe, but
     they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the
     declining authority of the Fatimid caliphs, which weakened their claim to the caliphate; conflicts
     within the Fatimid Empire weakened its ability to obtain the caliphate by conquest. Fatimid religious
     leaders were disillusioned by the weakness of Fatimid leaders and did not provide strong support.
     Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the resurgence of the Sunni orthodoxy
     under the Seljuks and the failure of the Ismaili Fatimids to attract support from other Shi’ites. Their
     defeat by the Crusaders and the emergence of powerful opponents such as Saladin ended their
     chances. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


4.   Evaluate the importance of institutions of learning (Dar al-’Ilm) in supporting Fatimid power.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of institutions of learning in supporting
     Fatimid power, weighing up the strengths and limitations or otherwise. Causes and results may
     extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may refer to the importance of these institutions in producing an educated bureaucracy
     and the production of missionaries who converted many to the Ismaili sect and spread the
     influence of the Fatimids. Institutions of learning made Cairo the intellectual centre of Islam and
     attracted many scholars. This increased the influence of the Fatimids and supported their claim to
     the caliphate. The institutions of learning increased contact with the non-Islamic world, which
     served to expand Fatimid commercial influences and prestige. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, but with a focus on the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by relevant evidence.
                                                  –6–                   N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   Discuss the importance of secular motives for those who participated in the Crusades.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of secular motives for
     those who participated in the Crusades. Reasons may predate the time frame, but must be clearly
     linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the prospect of acquiring land,
     wealth and social prestige. Adventure seekers and those hoping to escape legal and financial
     problems were also attracted. The opportunity to become a ruler of a territory was an incentive.
     Opportunities for establishing trade routes, acquiring profits and monopolies inspired some. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed, for example the Christian tradition of pilgrimage, the desire to
     obtain salvation and a desire to protect the Church and demonstrate respect for the papacy. The
     influence of church leaders also provided an incentive. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   To what extent was Muslim success during the Crusades the result of their weapons and tactics?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Muslim success during the
     Crusades was the result of their weapons and tactics. Causes may predate the timeframe, but
     must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the tactical skills
     of Muslim leaders such as Saladin, improvements in siege weapons which aided the Muslims, as
     did their mobility, geographic knowledge and strategy of avoiding pitched battles. Other relevant
     factors may be considered, such as the numerical weakness of the Western forces, the poor
     leadership shown in many cases by Western forces and the growing strength, unity and confidence
     of the Muslims after the First Crusade. Declining interest and support for the Crusades by Europe
     is also an important factor to consider. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –7–                  N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   “A lack of opposition was the major reason for the success of Ottoman expansion.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that a lack of opposition
     was the major reason for Ottoman expansion. Reasons may predate the timeframe, but must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the weakness of the
     Byzantine Empire which was the Ottomans’ major opponent. The collapse of Tamerlane’s empire
     had also removed a barrier to Ottoman expansion. European opponents of Ottoman expansion
     were weak and divided amongst themselves. Some Balkan rulers were willing to submit to
     Ottoman vassalage. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the strong military
     forces organized by the Ottomans and their extensive military experience, as well as their adoption
     of the latest military technology and their high level of training. In addition, their tolerant rule of
     conquered territories attracted much support and weakened their enemies. Candidates’ opinion or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   “The Ottoman Empire made limited changes to the Islamic world.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the Ottoman Empire made
     limited changes to the Islamic world. The results may extend beyond the timeframe, but must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the Ottomans’
     continuation of the policies of their predecessors: maintaining and expanding the Islamic world,
     organizing the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and continuing support for the Sunni
     orthodoxy. They did not make extensive changes to government in the Empire, but collected taxes
     and allowed local authorities to rule, provided they supported Ottoman policies and demonstrated
     loyalty to the Empire. They did make cultural changes in architecture and the promotion of the
     Arabic language in poetry and literature. They also developed trade, diplomatic relations and
     alliances with the West. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be clearly presented and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    “Trade was more important than the influence of Catholicism to the rise and expansion of the
      Kingdom of the Kongo.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that trade was more important than the influence of Catholicism to the rise and expansion of the
      Kingdom of the Kongo. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two factors, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of either. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates
      may refer to the external and internal trade in metal goods, cloth, pottery and ivory and the ways in
      which this facilitated economic growth and territorial expansion. They may note that trade first
      attracted the Portuguese, and that the Catholic missionary presence contributed to development in
      the kingdom through the establishment of schools and hospitals. The conversion of Afonso I to
      Christianity and the spread of a syncretic Catholicism contributed to a strong sense of national
      identity. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the importance of administrative
      systems, but with a focus on the issues in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Examine the role of systems of government in the rise and decline of the Ghana Empire.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between systems of government
      and the rise and decline of the Ghana Empire. Candidates may offer equal coverage of rise and
      decline, or they may prioritize their examination of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may mention that the rulers of Ghana were descended from a long line of
      kings, arming them with a dynastic legitimacy that strengthened their authority. They commanded a
      highly centralized and efficient bureaucracy, raising revenue by taxing the trade in gold and salt. As
      the empire expanded, many states on its periphery fell under its protection. Over time, however, rival
      empires emerged, such as Sila, and the borderland vassal states were increasingly drawn to these
      new centres of gravity. The empire contracted, finally splitting apart. Other relevant interrelationships
      may be considered, for example the role of trade in the rise and decline, but with a focus on the issue
      in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
                                                    –9–                   N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   Discuss the social, economic and political causes of the Mfecane/Difaqane.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social,
      economic and political causes of the Mfecane/Difaqane. Causes may predate the timeframe, but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the rise of
      Shaka and the wars of conquest unleashed by the Zulu against neighbouring Nguni kingdoms, or
      to his military innovations, which were then copied by his victims and used against other groups.
      Candidates may mention social factors, such as the use of age grade regiments, as well as the
      practice of capturing cattle from defeated enemies and absorbing their women and children into the
      Zulu state. Candidates may focus on the rapid population growth in the region (followed by a
      period of drought) that put severe pressure on scarce resources, competition between kingdoms
      for control of trade routes to the Portuguese port at Delagoa Bay and the slave raids from the Cape
      that destabilized Nguni society. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Discuss the main reasons for the rise of two of the following: the Mandinka Empire under
      Samori Toure; the Lozi kingdom under Lewanika; the Ndebele kingdom under Mzilikazi and
      Lobengula; the Asante empire under Osei Tutu; the Nyamwezi under Mirambo; the Hehe state
      under Mkwawa.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the rise of two of the African states specified in the question. Reasons may predate the timeframe,
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of both states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the role of charismatic leadership in winning
      support and maintaining the loyalty of subjects. They may stress the importance of economic
      factors such as trade, which often led to the ability to acquire firearms. Military conquest of rival
      groups may also be considered, or alternatively the ability to persuade rivals to form alliances or
      submit and pay tribute. The importance of efficient administrative structures may also be stressed,
      as well as the role of traditional religious practices and other cultural factors in contributing to the
      task of state-building. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   “The most important reasons for the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade were rivalries and
      warfare between African states.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the most important reasons for the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade were rivalries and
      warfare between African states. Reasons may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the warfare that contributed to
      the demise of powerful states such as the Songhai Empire before the arrival of Europeans, which
      made it easier for slavers to establish a coastal presence. They may stress how some groups took
      advantage of rivals by working with slavers, who provided them with firearms. Candidates may
      point out that rivalry had led to an existing slave trade in the region, a factor which facilitated the
      development of the Atlantic trade. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      technological developments and the impact of plantation agriculture in the Americas, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   To what extent was colonial expansion the main factor in the decline of the East African slave
      trade?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      colonial expansion was the main factor in the decline of the East African slave trade. Candidates
      may refer to the British decision to outlaw the slave trade in 1807, and slavery itself in 1834.
      Abolition of the trade was one of the factors that motivated explorers such as David Livingstone,
      who viewed formal colonization as key to realizing this goal. As Britain extended its influence, its
      consul in Zanzibar, John Kirk, pressured the Sultan to end the trade. His decision to close the
      market in 1873 was a crucial moment in its demise. Candidates may argue that the presence of the
      Royal Navy in the Indian Ocean was another crucial factor in the suppression of the trade. They
      may also note that Ethiopia was not colonized and that slavery persisted in that country, or that the
      Germans formally abolished slavery in their territories, but did little to enforce this. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                     – 11 –               N20/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   Evaluate the role of national rivalry in the partition of Africa.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of national rivalry in the partition
      of Africa, weighing up the strengths and limitations of its significance as a factor. Candidates may
      argue that popular enthusiasm for imperialism was perceived as a vote-winner in Europe and
      encouraged governments to expand in Africa at the expense of rivals – whilst acknowledging that
      some historians have challenged this interpretation. They may refer more generally to rivalry
      between powers, Britain and France in particular. Thus, tension resulting from the British occupation
      of Egypt led to the breakdown of the “gentleman’s agreement” in West Africa and a scramble in that
      part of the continent. Similarly, Bismarck’s newfound enthusiasm for imperialism and the response of
      rival powers led to the Berlin West Africa Conference, precipitating a further scramble. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example economic and strategic factors and the weakness of African
      states, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Compare and contrast the activities of King Leopold II of Belgium and De Brazza in the Congo
      region.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the activities of King Leopold II of Belgium and De Brazza in the Congo region, referring to both
      throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the
      ways in which both were motivated by annexationist ambition in the Congo. Both had economic
      motives and were inspired by the prospect of material gain: for personal profit in Leopold’s case
      and for France in the case of De Brazza. Both De Brazza and Stanley, who was Leopold’s agent,
      competed to sign treaties with African rulers: the “race” to Makoko was won by De Brazza.
      Candidates may point to the brutal and rapacious nature of Leopold’s rule, in contrast to De Brazza
      who was viewed as a benevolent administrator. They may also note that Leopold used agents
      while De Brazza was himself an explorer. De Brazza served as Governor-General of the French
      Congo while Leopold presided over the Congo Free State, a sort of personal colonial fiefdom.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   Examine the results of Menelik II’s resistance to European imperialism in Ethiopia.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between Menelik’s resistance
      to European imperialism and the results of that resistance for Ethiopia. Results may extend beyond
      the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to Menelik’s military success at the Battle of Adowa. This meant that Italy’s imperial ambitions
      were thwarted and Ethiopia’s independence preserved. His victory led to the Treaty of Addis Ababa
      in which Italy rescinded its claims to a protectorate. The border between Ethiopia and Eritrea was
      formally demarcated to Menelik’s advantage. Ethiopian sovereignty was further strengthened through
      a series of treaties with other European powers, and Menelik was able to expand his territory to the
      south. Candidates may point out that victory allowed Menelik to bolster his authority at home and
      embark on a series of modernizing reforms. The economy grew and there were significant
      developments in the fields of banking, healthcare, education and transport. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   “Collaboration with the British was mainly influenced by the prospect of political gain.” Discuss with
      reference to either Khama or Apolo Kagwa.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that collaboration with the British was mainly influenced by the prospect of political gain, with
      reference to either Khama or Apolo Kagwa. Candidates may refer to ways in which collaboration
      allowed African rulers to exercise sub-imperialism over rival groups. Khama was able to guarantee
      the ascendancy of the Bamagwato, and indeed of his family, in Bechuanaland, while Apolo Kagwa
      was able to preserve the dominance of the Protestant Baganda elite in colonial Uganda. Under the
      Uganda Act, he became prime minister and was able to use his power to marginalize traditional
      rivals such as the Bunyoro. Candidates may note that Khama’s decision may have been influenced
      by his Christianity, or his calculation that the British might prove more benevolent colonizers than
      the Germans or Boers. They may argue that Apolo Kagwa’s decision was influenced by the
      example of Kabaka Mwanga, whose earlier resistance ended in defeat and exile. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Compare and contrast the impact of German and British rule in Tanganyika.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the impact of German and British rule in Tanganyika, referring to both throughout. There does not
      need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the impact of economic policies on
      Africans: both the Germans and the British favoured the development of a cash crop economy, and
      Africans were obliged to pay hut tax to force them into wage labour. Candidates may also point out
      that neither power attempted to develop Tanganyika as a colony of settlement. For contrast,
      candidates may make the obvious point that unlike Germany, Britain ruled Tanganyika not as a
      protectorate but under the terms of a League of Nations mandate. German rule was altogether
      more brutal, resulting in frequent anti-colonial revolts such as the Maji Maji rebellion. Unlike the
      Germans, who only relinquished control of Tanganyika following military defeat in the First World
      War, the British encouraged nationalists like Nyerere and enacted a series of legislative reforms
      leading to self-government and independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   “Regional differences were the main factor in shaping political developments in Nigeria during the
      colonial period.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that regional differences were the main factor in shaping political developments in colonial Nigeria.
      Candidates may note that the system of administration used by the British was based on regional
      differences. In the north, a system of indirect rule led to the exercise of power through the former
      rulers of Sokoto Caliphate. There was less opposition here than in other parts of the territory.
      Acephalous Igboland was ruled more directly and the paramount chiefs chosen by authorities were
      deeply unpopular. A modified system of indirect rule was employed in Yorubaland and this was
      met with considerable resistance. Candidates may point out that nationalist politics developed
      along regional lines, with the pre-independence period characterized by fierce rivalry between
      regional parties. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example economic factors and the
      broader context of British imperial policy, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Compare and contrast the factors that led to the independence of Angola and South-West Africa.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the factors that led to independence in Angola and South-West Africa, referring to both throughout.
      There does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the role of armed
      struggle in the achievement of independence in each territory, and of factors such as racial
      oppression and poverty in fuelling opposition to colonial rule. Conversely, they may argue that it
      was external factors that led to independence in each country: in Angola, the Carnation Revolution
      and the collapse of the Estado Novo; in South-West Africa, political pressure on South Africa from
      the US and the waning of the apartheid system. For contrast, candidates may note South-West
      Africa’s unique status as a UN trust territory and the frequent calls for Pretoria to relinquish control.
      They may also highlight the role of three liberation movements in Angola – the MPLA, UNITA and
      the FNLA – in contrast to Namibia where SWAPO was the sole standard-bearer of the
      independence cause. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


22.   Evaluate the contributions of internal and external factors in the achievement of independence
      in Ghana.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions of internal and
      external factors in the achievement of independence in Ghana, weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of each. Candidates may offer equal coverage of internal and external factors, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to the role of Nkrumah and other nationalist politicians in the United Gold
      Coast Convention and the Congress People’s Party, the reforms of Governor Guggisberg,
      post-war riots and the Burns Constitution, the Positive Action campaign, and negotiations and
      constitutional developments following Nkrumah’s release from jail. For external factors, candidates
      may note the post-war economic and political weaknesses of the British and the precedent of
      Indian independence. They may allude to the enthusiasm of some British politicians, including
      Harold Macmillan, for decolonization, and the fear that Nkrumah might draw close to the Soviet
      Union if there were to be any further delays to independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   To what extent can Abdul Hamid be considered a reformer?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Abdul Hamid can be considered
      a reformer. Reasons and/or results may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to his proclamation of the 1876 constitution,
      establishing a constitutional monarchy and individual rights. He improved Ottoman finances, reduced
      debt and the cost of government as well as modernizing communications, transportation and the
      armed forces. However, he abused the constitution to exercise absolute power. Parliament was never
      summoned after 1878. He eliminated opposition through extra-legal means, operated a ruthless secret
      police service and brutally persecuted minority groups. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example his successes/failures in foreign relations and how they affected the improvement or
      modernization of the Ottoman Empire. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War on the Ottoman Empire up to 1923.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the First World War on the Ottoman Empire up
      to 1923, weighing up its strengths and limitations or otherwise. Consequences may extend beyond
      the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to the dissolution of the Empire and its reduction to a limited area of Anatolia. Extensive loss
      of life and widespread damage to property and installations also resulted. The Treaty of Sevres
      provoked an armed nationalist movement under Ataturk. This war of resistance led to widespread
      ethnic persecutions and expulsions from Turkish and Greek territory. A war against Greece
      occurred in 1922 and resulted in the Turkish recovery of extensive territory, confirmed by the
      Treaty of Lausanne, which established the boundaries of modern Turkey. The Sultan was expelled
      and Turkey became a democratic republic under the leadership of Ataturk. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   Evaluate British administration in Iraq and Transjordan.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the British administration in Iraq and Transjordan, weighing up
      its strengths and limitations or otherwise. Consequences/results may extend beyond the timeframe,
      but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to British policies
      that were successful in moving Iraq towards independence, achieved in 1932, resolved boundary
      disputes and provided Iraq with revenues from its oil fields. Britain did not implement a democratic
      state and continued to maintain military bases and oil rights, which led to unrest and demonstrations
      from Iraqi nationalists. Transjordan was given increased autonomy after the First World War and
      became almost entirely independent by 1939 and fully so in 1946. Britain provided financial support
      and training for the armed forces throughout the period, even after independence and Emir
      Abdullah’s installation as king. The British support of Abdullah was instrumental in uniting the
      country. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


26.   “Jewish immigration to Palestine was the main cause of Arab-Jewish tensions up to 1939.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of immigration as a cause of Arab-Jewish
      tensions up to 1939. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to increased Jewish immigration after 1919,
      causing the Arabs to fear the creation of a Jewish state and the denial of Arab sovereignty. British
      failure to accept the limits on immigration proposed in the 1930 White Paper led to riots and the
      Arab rebellion between 1936 and 1938. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      increasing Jewish economic power through land purchases and industrial development, and the
      creation of Jewish armed forces, which threatened Arab power. British policies, beginning with the
      Balfour Declaration, were contradictory, which raised suspicions on both sides. Growing Arab
      nationalism in the Middle East also contributed to the disputes in Palestine. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   Examine the reasons for the successes and failures of the Economic Community of West African
      States (ECOWAS).

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the reasons for failure
      and the reasons for success of ECOWAS. Candidates may offer equal coverage of reasons for
      success and failure, or they may prioritize their examination of either. However, both aspects will
      be a feature of the response. They may refer to the need for economic growth through regional
      cooperation as a factor in the success of ECOWAS. The West African Economic and Monetary
      Union (UEMOA), a customs union and single currency, was created by francophone countries in
      1994. Similarly, the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) was a monetary zone founded by other
      members with the aim of achieving fiscal integration in ECOWAS. The desire to preserve security
      led to the creation of the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), a body that intervened with
      some success in the civil war in Liberia. Candidates may refer to political rivalries and linguistic
      divisions as a major obstacle to success. They may also point to political instability and the
      frequent coups in the region, something that ECOWAS has been powerless to prevent.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


28.   “United Nations intervention was a complete failure.” Discuss with reference to two of the
      following: Congo, Mozambique, Somalia, Rwanda.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
      United Nations intervention was a complete failure, with reference to two of the four countries
      specified. Candidates may offer equal coverage of either of the two the countries selected, or they
      may prioritize their discussion of either. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates
      may argue that UN intervention in Somalia foundered when its operations were disrupted by militia
      activity. An American attempt to capture Mohamed Aidid failed and the UN withdrew shortly
      afterwards. Candidates may argue that UN intervention in Rwanda also failed. The UN Assistance
      Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) mandate was insufficiently robust and it was powerless to prevent the
      genocide that engulfed the country. On the other hand, the UN Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was
      able to partially fulfil its mission by restoring stability and preventing the secession of the Katanga
      region. Moreover, the UN Observer Mission in Mozambique (UNOMOZ) was successful in
      monitoring and verifying the ceasefire that ended that country’s civil war. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Evaluate the effectiveness of protest against the segregation policies of Smuts and Hertzog
      (1910–1948).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of protest against the
      segregationist policies of Smuts and Hertzog in South Africa. Candidates may refer to the creation
      of the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) in 1912, but argue that it was initially an
      elitist group petitioning the government for gradual reforms. Delegations were sent to London to
      protest the introduction of segregation policies, but to very limited effect. Candidates may point to
      the emergence of a more radical but short-lived opposition in the 1920s in the form of the Industrial
      and Commercial Workers Union (ICU). They may also note that the African National Congress
      (ANC) did not initially forge links with the white labour movement. Blacks were not involved in the
      Rand Rebellion, the most significant revolutionary challenge to the government during the
      segregation period. However, candidates may point out that the ANC was radicalized and
      revitalized following the Second World War. The Miners’ Strike of 1946 marked the beginning of a
      more radical, mass-based opposition to white minority rule. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “De Klerk’s actions had limited impact on the end of the apartheid system.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      FW De Klerk’s actions had limited impact on the end of the apartheid system. Candidates may
      agree with the statement by arguing that South Africa was already in deep trouble by the time
      De Klerk became state president, with its economy in crisis, violent unrest in the townships and
      global condemnation of the apartheid system. Alternatively, they may stress the role of other
      figures, such as Nelson Mandela. Candidates may disagree with the statement by pointing to
      De Klerk’s acknowledgement that the future of the Afrikaner people could be best guaranteed not
      by the continuation of apartheid but by its reform and eventual dismantlement. They may refer to
      his decision to unban the African National Congress (ANC), negotiate with Mandela and then
      release him from jail. De Klerk agreed to the creation of the Convention for a Democratic South
      Africa (CODESA), which paved the way for the first non-racial elections in 1994. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   Examine the reasons for the spread of Christianity in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship of Christianity and its spread in Africa in the 19th and
      20th centuries. Causes may predate the timeframe, but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the exploration of Africa and medical advances which
      opened Africa to missionaries. The wealth of Western Europe provided financial support for
      missions, imperial conquests brought military protection and improved communications. Converts
      were attracted by the economic and educational benefits that the Church provided. The defeat of
      non-Christian powers through colonial wars opened opportunities for Church expansion. Church
      opposition to the slave trade and support for many initiatives of social progress also attracted many
      converts. The prestige of the colonial powers attracted ambitious individuals who wished to
      associate with Western power and converted in order to be accepted by Europeans. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Compare and contrast the impact of colonialism on cultural values in two African countries.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the impact of colonialism
      on cultural values in two African states, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an
      equal number of each. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe, but must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the influence on traditional art, music,
      crafts and literature. Traditional gender relationships and ethnic relations may be discussed, together
      with the influence of religion and other spiritual practices, as well as family relations including
      marriage/divorce, size of families and multi-generational living. Lifestyle changes, including dress and
      the use of media and modern communications, may also be considered. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

33.   Discuss the causes of, and the effects of, the intifadas.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for and the effects of the
      intifadas. Causes and consequences may extend beyond the timeframe, but must be clearly linked
      to the issues raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of causes and effects, or
      they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. For causes, candidates may refer to the expansion of Israeli settlements, the domination
      of the Palestinian economy by Israel, which was blamed for widespread poverty, and the lack of
      support for the Palestinian cause from other countries, which encouraged the Palestinians to act.
      The effects included numerous Palestinian casualties which made the demonstrations more
      militant, together with Israel’s loss of popularity at home and abroad. The Palestinian Liberation
      Organization (PLO) gained support for its two-state proposals. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example Middle Eastern wars and the role of international organizations.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


34.   “Economic problems were the main cause of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that economic problems were the
      main cause of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Causes may predate the timeframe, but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the hardship caused by
      periods of rapid inflation, the increased income disparity between rural and urban areas as well as
      social classes. The extravagance of the imperial court and the rise in military spending caused
      resentment. Other relevant factors may be addressed, including the lack of political debate, the
      ruthless suppression of opposition and alienation of supporters of democracy, and the close
      relationship with the United States which alienated many who resented the influence of foreign
      powers. The modernizing policies of the Shah offended traditionalists and devout Muslims. The
      ability of Ayatollah Khomeini to unify all the opponents of the Shah was a key factor. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

35.   “Personal ambition was the main cause of ethnic conflict.” Discuss with reference to two African
      countries.

      The question requires that candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that personal ambition was the main cause of ethnic conflict in two African countries. Candidates
      may refer to individual leaders who sought to justify their seizure of power by encouraging conflict
      with other ethnic groups, who were deemed inferior or hostile. They may also look at ways in which
      individual rulers introduced new ideologies to encourage opposition to other ethnic groups in order to
      seize their land, power, etc. Other explanations of ethnic conflict may be addressed, for example the
      role of external influences, either physical or ideological; the legacy of colonial rule; long-standing
      ethnic rivalries; or rapidly changing economic, social or ideological circumstances. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   With reference to two African countries, examine the reasons for their success or failure in
      returning to multi-party democracy.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between success and failure in the return to multi-
      party democracy in two African countries. Candidates may refer to reasons for success including
      the collapse of the non-democratic group through war, death of a leader, internal division or
      external intervention. Other reasons may include the rise of a democratic leader with wide popular
      support and internal and/or external support, and improved economic and social conditions
      including better ethnic relations. Reasons for failure may include the measures of the ruling party to
      eliminate opposition, the lack of a credible opposition movement or leader, the failure of opponents
      of the regime to co-operate due to ethnic or other differences, or the intervention of external forces
      to support the non-democratic regime and prevent any changes in ruler. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
