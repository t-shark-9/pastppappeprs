Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   Compare and contrast the political organization of one non-sedentary and one semi-sedentary
     society.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences of the
     political organization between one non-sedentary and one semi-sedentary society, referring to both
     throughout. In both cases candidates may refer to a lack of enough resources limiting the size of
     the population and, in turn, the complexity of the social and political hierarchy. Semi-sedentary
     societies did not develop states and were commonly led by chiefs who shared power with village
     councils. Candidates may contrast this condition with non-sedentary societies where continual
     migration prevented the development of a political hierarchy and alliances. Candidates may also
     compare the extent to which women enjoyed authority in both cases since family identity was
     calculated through the female line and they were seen as those in charge of gathering food.
     Candidates may refer to the populations from the west of the Mississippi River, the small islands in
     the Caribbean, the least fertile parts of South America, those located in the eastern half of North
     America and parts of the American Southwest, the large islands of the Caribbean, and central and
     eastern South America. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Examine the nature of landholding in two indigenous societies.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the nature of
     landholding in two indigenous societies. Candidates may state that the indigenous societies had a
     special relationship with the land, that was not linked to the notion of private property and that it
     was usually considered as sacred. Candidates may refer to centralized societies like the Aztecs
     where the population was divided into clans and each one was allocated with a temple and lands
     for agriculture purposes. They may also refer to the Inca Empire, where the land was considered a
     possession of the state and plots were allocated to communities of peasants (ayllus) that oversaw
     their management and the payment of taxes to the Empire. Throughout the Americas, there were
     also numerous communities that performed a mixture of hunter-gathering and agriculture activities.
     In those cases, the access to land depended on the family or the communal use and there were no
     permanent landholding or territorial claims. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   “For Europeans in the Americas, the acquisition of gold and silver was more significant than
     acquiring land.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that for Europeans in the Americas, the acquisition of gold and silver was more significant than
     acquiring land. To support the statement candidates may refer to the search for precious metals as
     the main aim that moved Columbus to explore new sea routes in order to avoid encounters with
     Muslim ships; to replace depletion of African mines and to supply the European need for gold and
     silver to mint coin; to pay the bureaucracy and army; to pay loans and for luxury purposes.
     Candidates may also claim that the search for precious metals was what propitiated the initial
     exploration and conquest of the territory in the Americas. Candidates may challenge the statement
     by referring to the search for land as the main goal, especially for the lower nobility, conquerors of
     poor origins and the emerging bourgeoisie. They may also argue that the acquisition of lands was
     important to boost the prestige of the European courts and to supply many products required in
     Europe, such as species of animals and wood. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   Examine the impact of conquest in the Americas on indigenous women.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the conquest in the
     Americas and its impact on indigenous women. Candidates may refer to a wide range of situations
     from indigenous women who enjoyed status in local communities and were married to conquerors
     as part of treaties or pacts, to the cases of those who were taken or relocated to work under
     European jurisdiction. Candidates may consider that in the Americas, the destruction of native
     family ties and matrilineal organization left women from many native communities in a vulnerable
     condition. Candidates may also refer to the compulsory introduction of Christian marriage and the
     approval of mixed marriage between native women and European men in 1514 that affected their
     role and status. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for example the separation of
     many women from their communities to live and work for Europeans as domestic servants,
     peasants, weavers, etc. This forced cohabitation with Europeans led to a process of acculturation
     and many women became a vector between native and European cultures. It also led to the birth
     of mestizos. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   Evaluate the rule of the Braganza in Portuguese America.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Braganza rule in Portuguese
     America, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may reference as strengths the
     establishment of an Overseas Council to better control the colonies, the ability to better defend and
     regain territory (like the regaining of Pernambuco from Dutch control), and the discovery of gold
     and diamonds that increased the resources of the dynasty. Candidates may also refer to the
     Pombaline reforms, which improved production and trade between Portugal and the colonies,
     boosted the Brazilian economy and centralised decisions and taxes. As limitations, candidates may
     refer to the conflicts with military divisions and the expansion of a new local elite in Brazil that
     challenged the Braganza policies. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
     political conflicts and competitions in Portugal that allowed for a stronger local administration in Rio
     de Janeiro. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


6.   Evaluate the impact of mercantilism on one colonial government in the New World.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of mercantilism on one
     colonial government in the New World, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may
     refer to mercantilism as the economic theory based on the idea that the wealth of a state depended
     on the amount of precious metals it could accumulate; promoting the reduction of imports; the
     expansion of exports; or the state’s intervention to control, regulate and limit business. This led to
     the application of several measures in colonial America to reinforce the presence and authority of
     the mother country. Due to its requirements of precious metals, the first impact of mercantilism was
     a stimulus for colonial expansion over new lands in search for mines. Mercantilism was also
     responsible for several policies that controlled production and trade in the colonies, banned
     industrial activities to protect European factories and regulated trade. This created a division of
     labour between the colonies and the imperial countries. While the colonies were supposed to
     provide metals and raw materials, the imperial countries produced manufactured goods.
     Candidates may refer to the limitations established by mercantilism as a cause of discontent for
     businessmen in the New World that eventually led to revolutions. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   Evaluate the political impact of the Catholic Church in Spanish America.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political impact of the Catholic
     Church in Spanish America, weighing up the strengths and limitations. Candidates may refer to the
     role of Pope Alexander VI, who in 1493, granted the Castilian kings the right to conquer America
     under the obligation to Christianize the population. They may also refer to the aid the Catholic
     church provided to legitimize the new Spanish authorities, presenting kings and conquerors as new
     rulers favoured with God’s support. The Catholic church also helped to remove traditional native
     leaders and local religious authorities accusing them of barbaric practices. Candidates may argue
     that, in certain cases, the Catholic church could support local chiefs who were baptized and
     adopted Catholicism. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the Catholic
     interpretation of the conquest as part of a divine plan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Examine the role of the Jesuits and the Recollects in New France.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the actions taken by
     the Jesuits and the Recollects in New France. Candidates may refer to the first Jesuits arriving in
     New France in 1611 and the settlement of the Recollects in Acadia, Newfoundland and Québec
     from 1516 onwards. Both religious orders’ main purpose was to convert the indigenous population
     to Catholicism and both were aware of the language barrier between them and the indigenous
     communities. The Jesuits settled among the Huron, learning their language and culture and
     building a number of missions that initially had little success. A significant part of the Jesuits'
     evangelical work involved education and the founding of parishes and schools. For its part, the
     Recollects considered that French settlers were of primordial importance to Christianization and
     promoted mixed marriages with natives. They also recruited truchements, men from humble origins
     from France that helped them to communicate with the local population through gestures and
     miming. The stay of the Recollects and their achievements were jeopardized in different moments
     by French policy and the Anglo-French War. Jesuits were also destabilized by the Papal
     suppression in 1773. Since Britain refused to allow the Jesuits and the Recollects to recruit new
     members, both orders declined. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Discuss the reasons for, and origins of, slavery in the New World.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and origins of, slavery in the New World. As origins, candidates may refer to the European or
      transatlantic slave trade, which began around 1500, during the early period of European
      discoveries, when slaves were often captured in raids or purchased from African kingdoms; while
      others were originally captured as prisoners of war. Regarding reasons, candidates may refer to
      the need for a workforce in the New World after the demographic fall within native communities as
      a result of wars and epidemics. Candidates may also consider the impossibility to allocate
      European peasants to the colonies, since few men were interested in moving to the Americas.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed. For example, the protection given to natives by some
      European crowns, who, influenced by the church, prevented natives from being enslaved and
      turned their attention to Africans, who were also experienced in intensive agriculture and knew how
      to raise crops that were unfamiliar to Europeans. Racist ideas about Africans supported the
      introduction of African slaves. The slave trade was also a lucrative trade that benefited European
      governments due to the taxes they charged. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   “Slavery had a limited economic impact in the New World.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      slavery had a limited economic impact in the New World. Candidates may support the statement
      by considering that slaves were not the only workforce in the New World and that plantations were
      not the only economic source of revenues, since gold and silver mines were, for a long time, the
      main source of wealth. Candidates may also support the statement by stating that products such
      as tobacco and cotton could be grown by farmers without the need of a large workforce. The fact
      that many slaves were given the possibility to buy their freedom and work as free men could be
      also discussed. Candidates may challenge the statement by referring to the loss of the local
      population and the difficulties in bringing over European farmers, which led to the practice of
      slavery. Candidates may also consider that many tobacco farms gradually became sugar
      plantations demanding a larger number of workers. Other relevant factors that may be addressed
      include the closeness between Africa and the Caribbean, the similarities in their climates and the
      fact that many Africans were already farmers. Candidates may argue that slavery was not banned
      until the 19th century, showing its economic importance. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   “The main reason for the Monroe Doctrine was to maintain Latin American Independence.” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      main reason for the Monroe Doctrine was to maintain the independence of Latin American nations.
      The Doctrine, stated by President James Monroe in 1823, warned that the US would not be
      favourable to any attempts by European powers to re-establish control over newly independent
      nations in Latin America. He also stated that the US would stay out of European affairs. Other
      reasons for the Doctrine could be the desire to preempt Great Britain from making a similar
      declaration, to protect American trade with Latin America and to establish Latin America as an
      American sphere of influence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “The economic cost of the wars of independence had a significant impact on society.” Discuss with
      reference to two societies.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the economic cost of the wars of independence had a significant impact on society.
      Candidates may support the statement by considering the amount of resources allocated for
      military campaigns, which exhausted the limited resources of the new states and forced them to go
      into debt. During the battles, many resources (goods, lands, ports, etc.) were destroyed while the
      number of casualties reduced the available workforce. The campaigns also dislocated traditional
      commercial channels, leaving the new states without the benefits of trade or the supply of
      necessary products. To challenge the statement, candidates may argue that the wars allowed the
      new states to gain new territories with valuable resources. They also helped to reshape the
      countries’ frontiers, allowing governments to apply better economic management. The period of
      battles also served to establish relationships with other European countries, like Great Britain and
      France, which became new partners in lucrative business. The period of war also allowed for the
      expropriation of belongings and properties that were in the hands of Spanish and English families,
      growing the treasury of the new states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   To what extent did the United States Constitution of 1787 resolve the limitations of the Articles of
      Confederation?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      United States Constitution of 1787 resolved the limitations of the Articles of Confederation.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the Constitution and the Articles, or they may prioritize
      their assessment of the Constitution. However, both aspects must be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to weaknesses of the Articles, such as the inability to levy taxes, raise an
      army and/or regulate interstate commerce. They may also refer to the lack of an executive branch
      and a judicial branch, and a unicameral legislature that treated all states the same. Candidates are
      likely to say the Constitution resolved these limitations by creating three branches of government
      with checks and balances; a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the House
      and equal representation in the Senate; by giving Congress the ability to tax, regulate interstate
      commerce, raise an army and declare war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   To what extent did one Latin American country overcome challenges to the establishment of a
      political system?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that one
      Latin American country overcame challenges to the establishment of a political system. Candidates
      may refer to economic, political, international and/or social factors. One reason that challenged the
      establishment of the political system during the period was the diversity of plans for the future
      political organisation, like in the examples of Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, where some leaders
      advocated for a republic and others for a monarchy. Another challenge was the fragile economy,
      the loss of resources due to the wars of independence, the disruption of traditional trade routes
      and markets, and the lack of tax systems. Candidates may consider the need to define the new
      frontiers and territories as another challenge since this triggered new conflicts, like in the case of
      Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The role of caudillos could also be assessed as a challenge to the
      establishment of the political system since many of them refused to leave power. Social conflicts
      derived from class differences and/or ethnic origins also challenged the establishment of the
      political system, like in the examples of Peru, Bolivia and Mexico. To measure the extent that one
      Latin American country succeeded or not in establishing a political system, candidates may refer to
      the holding of regular elections, the establishment of political parties and a congress, the signing of
      a constitution, etc. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 8: US Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   “Political leaders were more significant than military leaders during the Civil War.” Discuss.

      The question requires that the candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that political leaders were more significant than military leaders during the Civil War. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of political leaders and military leaders, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of significance. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates
      may refer to the significance of Lincoln for the Union and Jefferson Davis for the Confederacy.
      Military leaders that might be discussed could include McClellan, Meade, Hooker, Burnside, Grant
      or Sherman for the North. For the South: Lee, Jackson, Stuart, Johnston Longstreet or Forrest
      could be discussed. Candidates might argue that the significance of political and military leaders
      varied at different times during the war or on the eventual outcome of the war. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Examine the importance of African Americans to the Union victory in the Civil War.

      This question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between African Americans
      and the Union victory in the Civil War. Candidates may refer to slaves leaving plantations in the
      South after the Emancipation Proclamation, thus disrupting the economy of the South and hurting
      the Confederate cause. Between 180,000 and 200,000 African-American troops served in the
      Union Army, roughly ten percent of the total army. Though few African Americans saw battle, they
      performed many valuable jobs, freeing up white soldiers to fight. The most notable fighting unit was
      the 54th Massachusetts, which saw action in South Carolina. Some candidates might argue that
      African Americans had little to do with the eventual outcome as nearly all the major battles were
      conducted by white troops and that other factors had more to do with the outcome. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Discuss the causes of internal migration in two countries in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of
      internal migration in two countries in the Americas. Throughout this period, internal migration in
      many countries of the region followed one pattern: from rural areas to the cities. Candidates may
      refer to the changes introduced in rural areas like the use of machinery or the replacement of
      agriculture for livestock activities, that caused many workers to leave rural areas for cities. The
      factories placed in the cities demanded labour and offered many job positions. This, together with
      the perspective of gaining access to education, health assistance, trade, etc., also pushed many
      migrants to move to the cities. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the
      consequences of the wars of independence that destroyed the countryside in many states and
      forced its inhabitants to move to the cities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Evaluate the impact of “indigenismo” in two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of “indigenismo”, weighing up its
      strengths and limitations in two countries of the Americas. “Indigenismo” was a movement that
      advocated for a dominant social and political role for indigenous populations, particularly in those
      countries where they were a majority. Candidates may argue that during the second half of the
      19th century “indigenismo” was a response to the policies taken by the new states to counteract
      their attempt to assimilate the indigenous populations and to prevent the deterioration in their
      standards of living. This situation changed during the first half of the 20th century when the
      ideological message of “indigenismo” influenced the state policies in many countries, as well as the
      arts, literature and social sciences. Candidates may choose the examples of Mexico or Peru where
      “indigenismo” had a profound impact. In Mexico, the movement began with the revolution in 1911,
      and in Peru it influenced the Aprista movement. It was also strong in Bolivia and Brazil.
      Conversely, in countries like Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador and Guatemala, “indigenismo” had a
      more limited impact or remained a marginal phenomenon. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   Compare and contrast the impact of the Big Stick policy with that of Dollar Diplomacy.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences of the
      impact of the Big Stick policy and Dollar Diplomacy, referring to both throughout. There does not
      need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the immediate impact and the long-
      term impact of both. Similarities could be that they both dealt with Latin America and justified US
      intervention. Both policies resulted in military occupation of Caribbean and Central American
      nations. Both resulted in the US dominating the region. Differences could be that the Big Stick
      policy of Roosevelt implied the use of force or the threat of force to control nations, whereas the
      Dollar Diplomacy of Taft meant using investments in Latin American nations to influence them.
      Despite the apparent differences, both resulted in US intervention. The impact of each policy will
      also be dependent upon the countries chosen. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   “German aggression was the most important reason for US entry into the First World War.” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      German aggression was the most important reason for US entry into the First World War. The
      renewal of unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany in February 1917, is often seen as the
      reason for US entry. German aggression might include the Zimmerman telegram to Mexico urging
      them to enter the war against the US. Other reasons for US entry could be to support the Allies, to
      ensure repayment of loans made to the Allies and Wilson’s desire to participate in post-war peace
      talks. Candidates may refer to many reasons for US entry, but they must focus on whether German
      aggression was the most important reason. Candidates’ opinions or conclusion will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   Examine the challenges faced by Obregón and Calles between 1920 and 1940.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the challenges faced
      by Obregón and Calles between 1920 and 1940. Candidates may refer to the challenges faced by
      Obregón during his presidency like his challenging relationship with the Regional Confederation of
      Mexican Workers (CROM) and his secretary Morones Negrete, or the conflict with the Catholic
      Church that did not approve a number of articles from the constitution and therefore limited its
      action. Another serious challenge was the rebellion of Obregón’s former finance minister, Adolfo de
      la Huerta. Regarding the presidency of Calles, candidates may refer to the menace of military
      coups that forced the president to reduce the influence of the army in Mexico’s political life.
      Calles’s anticlerical policies were more severe than those taken by Obregón since Calles was
      determined to remove the influence of the Catholic Church in politics and education. This renewed
      the old conflict with the church provoking the Cristero War. Calles also approved legislation
      restricting alien ownership of land and regulating the petroleum industry. Both actions, together
      with the rejection of the Bucareli treaty and Mexico’s support to liberals in Nicaragua, aggravated
      relations with the US. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


22.   Evaluate the impact of the Mexican Revolution on women.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Mexican Revolution
      on women, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may refer to their incorporation,
      voluntary or compulsory, as soldiers. Known as soldaderas; women took part in the fighting and
      also provided a range of services like foraging, food preparation, arms smuggling and nursing.
      Candidates may also refer to the impact of the revolution on women’s work since it affected
      industrial production: causing factory closures and wage reductions. The revolution also pushed
      women to participate in mutual aid societies, mobilizations and strikes across the region of Mexico
      City. The recognition gained by women during the Revolution led to the celebration of the first
      feminist congress in 1916 with the aim of promoting women’s right to vote. Other relevant factors
      may be addressed, for example, president Carranza’s new Law of Family Relations that gave
      married women new rights: allowing for paternity suits (previously forbidden) and the recognition of
      illegitimate children; or the Constitution of 1917 that incorporated a number of laws to protect
      working mothers and their children. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   “Critics of the New Deal had limited impact.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that critics
      of the New Deal had limited impact. Candidates may support the statement by indicating that
      despite criticism from the left and from the right, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was able to pass
      nearly all New Deal legislation. Well-known critics include the American Liberty League, which
      warned of the dangers of socialism; Father Charles Coughlin who challenged the New Deal for not
      doing more; and Senator Huey Long with his Share the Wealth Clubs. The Republican Party was
      opposed to most of FDR’s programs but because of their limited numbers it had little impact.
      Candidates might counter the statement by emphasizing the Supreme Court rulings, declaring the
      Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) and the National Recovery Administration (NRA)
      unconstitutional. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


24.   “Import substitution industrialization (ISI) was successful in dealing with the problems of the Great
      Depression.” Discuss with reference to one Latin American country.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of whether import
      substitution industrialization (ISI) was successful in dealing with the problems of the Great
      Depression in one Latin American country. Argentina and Brazil are the most likely choices, but
      other countries are possible. For Brazil, Vargas implemented ISI by state-guided capitalism,
      sometimes called corporatism, and stimulated production in steel and iron. Brazil’s industrial output
      doubled between 1931 and 1936. For Argentina, the Concordancia established new industries in
      chemical, electrical and metal products, though mostly with foreign capital. Domestic production
      increased and by 1936, most of the crisis had ended. Candidates may discuss other problems
      associated with the Great Depression, for example, social unrest, but the focus should be on
      economic issues. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   To what extent did the United States follow its policy of neutrality prior to entering the Second
      World War?

      The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which the United States followed its
      policy of neutrality prior to entering the Second World War. Candidates may refer to the Neutrality
      Acts of 1935, 1936 and 1937, which limited US response to aggression abroad. The Acts
      established that the US wished to stay out of war by eliminating some of the factors, such as
      selling weapons and making loans to belligerent nations, which pulled it into the First World War.
      However, as the Second World War began, US policy shifted to allow some aid to the Allies. The
      Neutrality Law of 1939 allowed the US to sell weapons on a cash-and-carry basis. In 1941, this
      became known as Lend-Lease. The US also traded destroyers to Great Britain in 1940 and later
      took over defense of the western Atlantic. In 1941, the US and Great Britain signed the Atlantic
      Charter. In Asia, as Japan expanded into China and Indochina, the US established partial, then
      total, trade embargoes. Candidates will have to decide if these actions follow a policy of neutrality.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


26.   Discuss the reasons for, and significance of, US use of atomic weapons against Japan.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and significance of, US use of atomic weapons against Japan. Candidates may refer to military,
      economic and political reasons. They may cite that the US used atomic bombs to end the war as
      soon as possible in order to save lives and to forgo a land invasion of the mainland. Some might
      say Truman used atomic weapons to show the USSR the power of the US, in the hope of making
      Stalin more cooperative. Other reasons could be to justify the enormous cost of the bomb, to get
      revenge on Japan for Pearl Harbor and to gain popular support. The significance of the use of
      atomic weapons could be the quick conclusion of the war, though that is debatable; it began the
      atomic age and the arms race; and the establishment of the US as a superpower. Candidates
      might include other reasons and explanations of significance. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   “Social unrest was the most significant reason for the failure of elected leaders in Latin America.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that social unrest was the most significant reason for the failure of elected leaders in Latin America.
      Candidates may refer to different social movements that could encompass political parties,
      minorities, left- or right-wing movements, etc. Candidates may also refer to the banning of popular
      political parties that led to social conflicts between their supporters and the government. Some may
      refer to social unrest led by minorities and/or groups that were disenfranchised like indigenous
      populations and peasants, etc. Candidates may challenge the statement by considering that the
      main problem elected leaders faced was their illegitimacy, particularly in those cases where
      popular parties or politicians were disqualified from elections. Candidates may also refer to
      unsolved economic problems as the main challenge faced by elected leaders. During this period,
      the influence of the Cold War and the interventions of the US and USSR also encouraged civilian
      demonstrations and military rebellions that undermined democracy and elected leaders.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


28.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment of opposition by one military dictator in Latin America.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the treatment of opposition by one
      military dictator in Latin America, weighing up its effectiveness. Candidates may refer to the wide
      range of policies used to deal with opposition such as the control of the mass media and the
      education system; censorship; the suspension of elections; the proscription of political parties,
      unions, movements and associations. Military dictators in Latin America also compiled black lists of
      opponents in order to persecute them, force them into exile or to segregate them from social life.
      Military dictators also applied torture methods to defeat their opponents and discourage any act of
      rebellion and, in many cases, opponents were illegally imprisoned or killed. Candidates may refer
      to the effectiveness of these policies considering the survival or not of political parties and civil
      associations. They may consider the possibility some people had to denounce internationally the
      treatment of opposition. Also, the return of democratic systems could be considered as a failure of
      dictators. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   Evaluate the impact of the domestic policies of Eisenhower.

      This question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the domestic policies of
      Eisenhower weighing up the strengths and limitations of those policies. Eisenhower’s domestic
      policies were known as “dynamic conservatism”. It attempted to slow down the increased
      government involvement from the New Deal and Fair Deal. Candidates may refer to the expansion
      of coverage and benefits of Social Security, increased college student loans and increased federal
      funding for the teaching of science and math in response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik.
      Eisenhower was also responsible for the National Highway Act, which started the interstate
      highway system, and the St. Lawrence Seaway Agreement with Canada. Candidates may also
      refer to Eisenhower’s enforcement of Supreme Court decisions outlawing segregation in schools,
      such as at Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas and the passage of two civil rights bills.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


30.   To what extent was there social and political change under Pearson and Trudeau?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that there
      was social and political change under Pearson and Trudeau. Candidates are likely to argue that
      there was significant social change under Pearson and Trudeau. They may refer to Pearson’s
      introduction of the Canadian Pension Plan and increases in unemployment insurance. Canada
      officially became a bilingual nation during the 1960s. Trudeau established universal health care
      and liberalized laws on abortion and homosexuality. Politically both were members of the Liberal
      Party. Both withstood the Quebec separatist movement, with Trudeau invoking the War Measures
      Act to suppress the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ)/Quebec Liberation Front. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Compare and contrast the policies of Kennedy and Johnson regarding US involvement in Vietnam.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      Kennedy and Johnson in terms of their policies regarding US involvement in Vietnam, referring to
      both throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to
      both presidents wanting to aid South Vietnam and prevent it from falling to communism. Both
      presidents gave military and financial aid to South Vietnam and both presidents increased US
      involvement throughout their presidencies. Contrasts are in the methods used to help South
      Vietnam. Kennedy continued the use of military advisors, increasing their number to nearly 16,000
      to train the South Vietnamese army. He also employed the Strategic Hamlet Program. Johnson,
      after getting the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, sent in combat troops in 1965 and began the campaign
      known as Operation Rolling Thunder, the heavy bombing of North Vietnam. Johnson
      “Americanized” the war, sending more and more US combat troops into action. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   “President Carter’s foreign policy improved US relations with Latin America.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that President Carter’s foreign policy improved US relations with Latin America. Candidates may
      refer to Carter’s foreign policy based on the defense of human rights. In so doing, he ended
      financial aid to repressive regimes in Latin America and placed sanctions on Argentina, Brazil and
      Chile. Whether these actions improved relations is debatable. In Nicaragua, the US ceased
      support of the repressive dictator Somoza and he was overthrown by the leftist Sandinistas. Carter
      provided economic aid to the Sandinistas. He also completed negotiations with Panama, turning
      control of the Canal over to Panama, and began negotiations with Cuba to improve relations.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   “Civil rights for indigenous peoples significantly improved after 1945.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that civil
      rights for indigenous peoples significantly improved after 1945. Candidates may refer to one or two
      countries in depth, or to several countries in a broader sense. Civil rights could include voting
      rights, legal rights, economic rights, equal education, restoration of lost lands, sovereignty over
      their affairs and support of their culture. Candidates may refer to the American Indian Movement in
      the United States and their actions at Alcatraz, or to the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Wounded
      Knee. For Canada, they might refer to the actions and accomplishments of First Nations, Inuit and
      Metis. In Mexico, candidates might refer to the actions and accomplishments of the National
      Zapatista Liberation Army (EZLN). Candidates might refer to actions taken by the United Nations
      and the passage of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Discuss the reasons for, and the impact of, youth protests in the 1960s and 1970s in one country
      of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      and the impact of youth protests in the 1960s and 1970s in one country of the Americas. Reasons
      for protests may predate the timeframe and consequences may go beyond the timeframe, but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the US and the
      anti-war movement, but accept any country where youth protests occurred. The youth protests in
      the US focused on the Vietnam War and the draft. Candidates may argue that the youth protests
      led to Johnson declining to run for re-election, caused both parties to campaign on ending the war,
      and eventually ending the draft. The youth protests also bolstered the presidential campaigns of
      Eugene McCarthy and Robert Kennedy. Youth protests in the US also supported the African
      American Civil Rights movement as well as the feminist movement. Students in Mexico protested
      against their government and in favour of land reform. Youth protests also occurred in Argentina,
      Brazil and Chile with varying causes and results. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   Evaluate the impact of Reagan’s foreign policy in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Reagan’s foreign policy
      in the Americas, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may refer to Reagan’s
      strong anti-communist stance and the Reagan Doctrine, which stated that the US would support
      anti-communist guerrilla and resistance movements to overthrow leftist-leaning or Soviet-backed
      governments in Latin America. This occurred in El Salvador and Nicaragua. Reagan used military
      force in the invasion of Grenada and supported dictatorships in Chile, Guatemala and Argentina.
      Regarding Canada, the US and Canada had similar foreign policies and Reagan and Canadian
      Prime Minister Mulroney had good relations. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   “Achieving justice and reconciliation has been the greatest challenge faced by new democracies in
      Latin America.” Discuss with reference to two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that achieving justice and reconciliation has been the greatest challenge faced by new
      democracies in Latin America by referencing two countries in the region. Candidates may refer to
      any two Latin American countries that became democratic during the time period. Possible choices
      could be Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Candidates are likely to
      discuss the difficulties in achieving justice and reconciliation and in making peace with previous
      opponents. This would be especially true in countries that emerged from previous repressive,
      authoritarian regimes. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, economic difficulties,
      corruption, the power of the military and the existence of oligarchs, but with a focus on the issue in
      the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
