Paper 2 assessment criteria

Criterion A — Focus on the question                                                                  [2]

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being raised
by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking down the
question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they understand the
issues or problems.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1        Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2        Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


Criterion B — Knowledge and understanding                                                            [6]

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of
psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
  1–2
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
  3–4
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
  5–6
             Psychological terminology is used appropriately.
                                                 –4–                 N20/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion C — Use of research to support answer                                                      [6]

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer
is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response.
  1–2
            Research selected serves to repeat points already made.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  3–4       partly explained.
            Research selected partially develops the argument.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  5–6       thoroughly explained.
            Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                    –5–                 N20/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D — Critical thinking                                                                            [6]

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their understanding
of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical thinking about the
knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support that knowledge
and understanding. The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive.
  1–2
             Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.

             The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development.
  3–4
             Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

             The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking.
  5–6
             Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.


Criterion E — Clarity and organization                                                                     [2]

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought underpinning
the argument.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
    1
             throughout the response.

    2        The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

Abnormal psychology

1.   Discuss normality versus abnormality.                                                          [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the role of
     clinical biases in diagnosis.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Jahoda’s (1958) work on ideal mental health
     • Rogers’ (1959, 1961) descriptions of the fully functioning person
     • Szasz’s (1974) and Scheff’s (1966) discussions about problems of psychiatric labelling
       and the medicalization of problems of living
     • Rosenhan and Seligman’s (1989) seven features of abnormality
     • Caetano’s (1974) study into the effects of labelling on student and psychiatrist diagnoses
       of video-taped actors.

     Critical discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • assumptions and biases in defining the concepts of normal and abnormal
     • areas of uncertainty in diagnostic manuals
     • methodological considerations in research
     • the influence of social and cultural norms on the perception of normality/abnormality
     • historical changes in our understanding of what constitutes normal and
        abnormal behaviour
     • ethical implications of definitions of normality and abnormality
     • ethical considerations related to labelling and stigmatization.

     Responses are likely to focus on explaining concepts of normality vs. abnormality and on related
     research. Marks awarded for criterion B should focus on how the responses reflect general
     knowledge of the topic including definitions of terms, explanations of theories and concepts.
     Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of a study/studies and
     assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question.
                                                   –7–                    N20/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



2.   To what extent do sociocultural factors influence the etiology of abnormal psychology?             [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of
     sociocultural factors to the etiology of psychological disorders.

     Examples of sociocultural factors include, but are not limited to:
     • poverty and social stress
     • social norms
     • influences of international media
     • processes of enculturation and acculturation.

Sociocultural factors” is a generic term so only one can be discussed (candidates do not have to
address two different sociocultural factors).

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Becker et al.’s (2002) study investigating the influence of television on the prevalence of
       eating disorder symptoms, using questionnaire data and semi-structured interviews
     • Brown and Harris’s (1986) study investigating the relationship between life events and
       depression in socially-disadvantaged females
     • Noh and Kaspar’s (2002) study on the moderating effects of coping, acculturation and
       ethnic support relating to perceived discrimination and depression among Korean
       immigrants in Canada
     • Chiao and Blizinsky’s (2010) study suggesting that cultural norms protect biologically
       vulnerable groups.

     It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address biological and cognitive factors in order
     to respond to the command term “to what extent”.

     Candidates may address one sociocultural factor in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge
     or may address a larger number of sociocultural factors in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may discuss the extent to which sociocultural factors influence the etiology of
     one psychological disorder or may provide a more general response on the extent to which
     sociocultural factors influence the etiology of several psychological disorders. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.

3.   Discuss the use of one or more psychological treatments for one psychological disorder.         [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the use of
     one or more psychological treatments in relation to one psychological disorder. Psychological
     treatments employ psychological theory to improve or eliminate symptoms of psychological
     disorders.

     The disorder chosen is likely to come from those presented in the guide:
     • anxiety disorders
     • depressive disorders
     • obsessive compulsive disorders
     • trauma and stress-related disorders
     • eating disorders.

     Psychological treatments chosen may include, but are not limited to:
     • Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)
     • Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
     • Exposure and Systematic desensitization
     • Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT)
     • Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
     • Group CBT.

     Descriptions of biological treatments can only be credited if they form part of the critical
     discussion of psychological ones.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Mason and Hargreaves’ (2011) qualitative investigation into the effectiveness of MBCT
     • Butler et al.’s (2006) review of meta-analysis related to CBT efficacy
     • Hodges and Oei’s (2007) discussion of the applicability of CBT to Chinese culture
     • McLay et al.’s (2011) assessment of the effectiveness of VRT for post-traumatic
       stress disorder.

     Critical discussion in relation to the use of the chosen treatment may include, but is not
     limited to:
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • comparison with alternative treatments
     • link to etiological considerations
     • advantages and disadvantages of its use
     • effectiveness based on empirical research
     • ethical considerations in its use.

     If a candidate discusses treatment for more than one psychological disorder, credit should be
     given only to the part of the response related to the first psychological disorder.

Developmental psychology

4.   Discuss the influence of poverty and/or socio-economic status on human development.            [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     influence of poverty and/or socio-economic status on human development.

     Candidates may discuss the influence of poverty/socio-economic status on one specific
     element of human development or may provide a general response of the influence of
     poverty/socio-economic status on human development. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Bhoomika et al.’s (2008) research on the effect of malnutrition on cognitive performance
       in Indian children
     • Wertheimer’s (2003) research on the correlation between academic achievement and
       living in poor families
     • Schoon’s (2002) longitudinal study investigating the long-term effect of poverty on
       academic achievement and attainment in adult life
     • Evans & Kim’s (2007) study on the effects of long-term exposure to poverty in childhood
       on both physical and mental health
     • Montgomery et al.’s (1996) research on the link between poverty and health of children
       and adolescents
     • Hoyert et al.’s (1999) research on the correlation between death rates in middle age
       and poverty
     • Russell et al.’s (2008) research on the influence of poverty on parenting.

     Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations in research related to the influence of poverty
        and/or socio-economic status
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings
     • cultural considerations
     • areas of uncertainty
     • assumptions and biases in research related to the influence of poverty and/or
        socio-economic status.

     Candidates may address one or a small number of potential effects of poverty/socio-
     economic status in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge or may address a larger
     number of potential effects of poverty/socio-economic status in order to demonstrate breadth
     of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   Evaluate one or more theories and/or studies relevant to the development of gender
     identity and/or social roles.                                                                      [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
     theories/studies related to the development of gender identity and/or social roles by
     weighing up the strengths and limitations of the theories/studies. Although a discussion of
     both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain
     high marks.

     Relevant theories related to gender identity and social roles may include, but are not
     limited to:
     • gender schema theory that stresses the key role of cognitive processes in the
        development of gender roles
     • social learning theory that highlights the importance of the social environment and
        emphasizes the potency of observational and modelling processes
     • theory of psychosexual differentiation that is based on the assumption that gender roles
        are related to genetic sex determined by chromosomes
     • evolutionary theory that attempts to locate gender role differences in a historical
        evolutionary context
     • theory of social roles related to socialization and division of labour within society.

     Relevant studies related to gender identity and social roles may include, but are not
     limited to:
     • Martin and Halvorson’s (1983) study showing the role of gender schemas on gender roles
     • Witt (1997); Fagot’s (1978) studies showing the influence of parents on gender roles
     • Neculaesei (2015); Mead’s (1935) studies showing that gender roles depend upon
        the society
     • Money and Ehrhardt’s (1972) study claiming that children are gender neutral at birth
     • Eagly and Wood’s (2016) study on social role theory of sex differences.

     Critical evaluation may include but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • contrary findings or explanations
     • the productivity of the theory in generating psychological research
     • the applications of the empirical findings
     • assumptions and biases.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should
     be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.


     For responses referring to evaluation of studies, marks awarded for criterion B should refer to
     definitions of terms, theories and concepts. Overall, this includes knowledge of the specific topic
     and general knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics (for example
     definitions of relevant terms in research methodology or ethics in research).
                                             – 11 –              N20/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of a study/studies and assess
how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this doesn’t have to be very
sophisticated or long for these questions but still the use of research should be linked to the topic
of the specific question.

Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
study/studies.

6.   Discuss one or more research methods used to investigate how humans develop
     as learners.                                                                                   [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Candidates may discuss research methods investigating specific aspects of cognitive/brain
     development (for example memory, intelligence, language or attention) or discuss research
     methods investigating cognitive/brain development in general. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

     Candidates may address the different research methods and their application - for example,
     a covert or naturalistic observation - but the focus should be on the nature of the research
     method and the reason for using it in the investigation of cognitive behaviour.

     Relevant research methods could include, but are not limited to:
     • interviews (eg, semi-structured)
     • naturalistic observations
     • correlational studies (eg surveys)
     • case study
     • experiments (laboratory, field or natural)

     Learning refers to changes in response to environmental stimuli. In developmental
     psychology research of brain development investigates how changes in the brain structure
     coincide with changes in certain cognitive functions. If they do coincide, we may infer that
     there is a link between structure and function.

     Relevant research studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Waber (2007); Giedd (2004); Chugani et al.’s (2001) correlational studies on the effects
       of maturation of the nervous system on cognitive development
     • Cowell et al. (2006); Corky’s (1997) correlational studies on brain damage and
       memory deficits
     • Deary et al. (2006); Bouchard et al.’s (1990) correlational studies on genetic inheritance
       in intelligence
     • Wolf et al.’s (2001) experimental study on cortisol and memory deficits in the elderly.

     A critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • why the method(s) was/were selected and the appropriateness of the method(s)
        including strengths and weaknesses of the method(s)
     • possible theoretical assumptions and/or biases in relation to the chosen method
     • the issues of validity and reliability
     • the generalizability of findings
     • the use of alternative/additional methods (triangulation)
     • ethical considerations.

       For questions that ask for discussion of one or more research methods, marks awarded
       for criterion B should refer to definitions of terms and concepts relevant for research
       methodology. Overall, this includes some knowledge of the specific topic (how humans
       develop as learners) and general knowledge and understanding related to research
       methods and ethics (for example definitions of relevant terms in research methodology or
       ethics in research).

       Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of a study/studies and
       assess how well the student linked aspects of the study to the question.

Health psychology

7.   Discuss one or more risk and/or protective factors influencing one or more health issues.        [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to make a considered review of one or
     more risk and/or protective factors influencing one or more of health issues.

     The health issues likely to be presented may come from one or more of the issues in the
     psychology guide (stress, addiction, obesity, chronic pain, sexual health). Responses
     referring to mental health issues should not be awarded marks.

     Risk factors may include, but are not limited to:
     • biological factors such as genetics, body type, high blood pressure
     • environmental factors such as lack of a readily available supply of healthy foods, access
        to clean water, the effects of pollution/noise
     • personal lifestyle choices such as tobacco, drug or alcohol consumption, hygiene,
        unsafe sexual practices.

     Protective factors may include, but are not limited to:
     • access to healthy foods and consequentially a healthy diet
     • a clean, abundant water supply
     • regular exercise habits
     • social support.

     Relevant studies may include but are not limited to:

8.   Using one or more health problems as examples, discuss prevalence rates.                         [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to make a considered review of prevalence
     rates, using one or more health problems as examples.

     Prevalence rates refer to the proportion of a population who have a specific characteristic at
     any given time. Prevalence can be influenced by cultural, gender and lifestyle factors.

     Health problems which may be discussed are likely to be one or more of the issues in the
     psychology guide (stress, addiction, obesity, chronic pain, sexual health). Responses
     referring to mental health problems should not be awarded marks.



     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:

9.     Discuss the effectiveness of one or more health promotion programmes.                           [22]

       Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

       The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one or
       more health promotion programmes.

       Health promotion programmes are an attempt to promote health behaviour. Health promotion
       programmes are those initiatives designed to assist people in gaining control over and
       improving their own health. These may be public or a government programmes, or may be
       privately sponsored. In addition, these programmes may be developed on an individual,
       local, national, or international level.

       Examples of health promotion programmes may include, but are not limited to:
       • food labelling programmes
       • stress reduction programmes such as MBSR or yoga
       • health education campaigns such as the TRUTH anti-tobacco campaign
       • public health campaigns designed to change beliefs and attitudes.

       Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
       • Peckmann and Reibling’s (2006) study of the effectiveness of fear campaigns
       • Yee et al.’s (2006) study of effectiveness of strategies to change behaviours related
         to obesity
       • Sly et al.’s (2002) survey on community based anti-smoking promotion among teens
       • Holm’s (2002) survey on the efficiency of health campaigns
       • Schum and Gould’s (2007) study of why health campaigns are effective.

      Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • Supporting and contradictory evidence of the programme’s success
      • Social engineering eg taxes and/or subsidies upon products such as sugar, tobacco,
         or alcohol
      • methodological concerns in measuring outcomes of the programme (e.g. small samples,
         no control group, no random allocation of participants and possibility of researcher bias).
      • cultural and ethical considerations in programme implementation
      • assumptions and biases
      • areas of uncertainty.
     • short-term versus long-term efficacy
     • age and gender considerations

Psychology of human relationships

10.   Discuss the role of communication in personal relationships.                                  [22]

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the role
      of communication in personal relationships.

      Communication plays a relevant role at all stages of the development of personal
      relationships. Examples of theories and models explaining the role of communication in
      relationships may include, but are not limited to: social penetration theory, approaches
      based on the concept of attributional styles and approaches based on the concept of
      patterns of accommodation.

      Candidates may address specific types of personal relationships (eg romantic, peer,
      parent–adolescent) or personal relationships in general. Both approaches are
      equally acceptable.

      Examples of studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Fincham’s (2004) study of the role of communication in marital satisfaction
      • Gottman and Levenson’s (1986) study on the role of communication of emotions in
        relationships
      • Burgoon et al.’s (2000) study of the use of mindfulness and interpersonal communication
      • Ying et al.’s (2015) study on parent-adolescent communication to build trust
      • Levenson and Gottman’s (1983) study on the relationship between marital dissatisfaction
        and negative affect
      • Tannen's work regarding male/female communication

      Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations in relation to the role of communication
         in personal relationships
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
      • implications of the findings
      • assumptions and biases in research related to the role of communication in
         personal relationships
      • areas of uncertainty
      • alternative theories/explanations.

      Candidates may discuss a small number of factors that explain the role of communication in
      relationships in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge or may consider a larger number of
      factors in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are
      equally acceptable.

11.   Discuss prejudice and/or discrimination in relation to group dynamics.                     [22]

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of prejudice
      and/or discrimination in relation to group dynamics.

      Group dynamics may include in-group dynamics as well as inter-group dynamics.

      Candidates may address topics such as, but not limited to:
      • stereotypes: negative and positive
      • inter-group discrimination
      • social identity.

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Sherif’s (1961) Robber’s Cave study
      • Steele’s (1997) stereotype threat interferes with school performance
      • Tajfel’s (1970) studies in inter-group discrimination
      • Pettigrew’s (2013) study on dynamics of inter-group contact.

      Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations in relation to research into
         prejudice/discrimination
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
      • implications of the findings
      • assumptions and biases
      • areas of uncertainty
      • alternative theories/explanations.

12.   Evaluate one or more research methods used in studies investigating social responsibility.         [22]

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
      research methods used in studies investigating social responsibility by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations of the research method(s). Although a discussion of both strengths
      and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

      Relevant research methods could include, but are not limited to:
       • interviews (eg, semi-structured)
       • naturalistic observations
       • correlational studies (eg surveys)
       • case study
       • experiments (laboratory, field or natural)

      Examples of research may include, but are not limited to:
      • Darley & Batson’s (1973) Good Samaritan study (field experiment)
      • Levine & Crowther’s (2008) experiment on group size and salient identity in by-standerism
      • Graves & Graves’s (1985) observational study into whether caring for young children
        increases prosocial behaviour
      • Barry & Wentzel’s (2006) correlational study of friend influence on prosocial behavior.

      A critical evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
      • why the method(s) was/were selected and the appropriateness of the method(s)
      • possible theoretical assumptions and/or biases in relation to the chosen method
      • the issues of validity and reliability
      • the generalizability of findings
      • the use of alternative/additional methods (triangulation).

      If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should
      be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.


      For questions that ask for evaluation of research methods, marks awarded for criterion B should
      refer to definitions of terms and concepts relevant for research methodology. Overall, this includes
      some knowledge of the specific topic (social responsibility) and general knowledge and
      understanding related to research methods and ethics (for example definitions of relevant terms in
      research methodology or ethics in research).

      Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of a study/studies and assess
      how well the student linked aspects of the study to the question.
