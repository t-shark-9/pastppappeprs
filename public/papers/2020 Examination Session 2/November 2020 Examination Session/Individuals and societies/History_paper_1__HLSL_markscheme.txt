Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source D, were the consequences of Richard I’s refusal to take
           Jerusalem?                                                                           [3]

           •   The decision was profoundly shocking to many crusaders.
           •   This provoked divisions amongst the crusaders.
           •   Richard I’s prestige was damaged by defamatory stories and songs.
           •   Richard I endangered the future of his empire in the West.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source B suggest about Richard I’s march towards Jerusalem?                [2]

           • Richard I led the march to Jerusalem.
           • The King was accompanied by numerous followers.
           • There were Arabs involved in the march.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source A for
     an historian studying Richard I’s involvement in the Third Crusade.                               [4]

     Value:
     • It is an extract of a speech made by Richard I prior to the Third Crusade.
     • It gives an insight into how Richard I sought to justify his strategy.
     • It provides information on the challenges facing Richard I.

     Limitations:
     • Although the speech refers to Richard I’s strategies, it lacks information on their impact.
     • Richard could be exaggerating some of his views in order to justify his actions.
     • The historian cannot be certain that the chronicle accurately records Richard’s words.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
     used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
     For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
     limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources C and D reveal about Richard I’s participation in the
     Third Crusade.                                                                                 [6]

       3–4      • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                   although these points may lack clarity.
        1–2     • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or general
                   comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison or of
                   contrast.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and
     award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of
     what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor
     exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources state that Richard I could not recapture Jerusalem.
     • Both sources argue that Richard I preferred to plan a campaign against Egypt.
     • Both sources support Richard I’s strategic decisions.
     • Both sources mention that there was tension between Richard and the French at the time
       of the Third Crusade.

     Contrasts:
     • While Source C states it was Richard I’s decision not to recapture Jerusalem, Source D refers to
       the role played by the council of barons.
     • While Source C claims that Richard I was admired by his contemporaries, Source D
       states his prestige was damaged.

     what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor
     exhaustive and no set answer is required. While it is expected that there will be coverage
     of at least two of the sources, candidates are not required to refer to all four sources in their
     responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             Richard claimed that the decision not to recapture Jerusalem was the
                          correct strategy. However, this caused division and may have weakened
                          the Third Crusade.

     Source B             Richard I is pictured as the leader of the crusaders. The king is
                          represented leading the march towards Jerusalem and commanding a
                          large group of followers.
                                        –7–                  N20/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source C        It is claimed that even if Richard I was not able to recapture Jerusalem,
                he was successful in taking strategic lands that brought substantial gain
                for the Christians in the Middle East. Richard I was recognized by his
                contemporaries for these actions.

Source D        Richard I’s decision to avoid recapturing Jerusalem was approved by a
                council of barons but caused despair among crusaders, provoking a
                division within the army and the defamation of Richard I. It also
                jeopardized his empire in the West.

Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to the leading role Richard I played in the Middle
                East commanding a multi-national force composed not only of his own
                subjects (English, Normans, Angevins, Gascons) but of French, Flemish,
                Germans, Scandinavians and natives of the crusader kingdoms. He
                organized highly complex operations and beat Saladin in a number of
                engagements. Candidates may also discuss the campaigns that allowed
                Richard I to conquer important territories like the coastline from Jaffa to
                Antioch, the island of Cyprus and the port of Acre that enabled
                Christians to have a base to connect Western Europe with the Middle
                East.
                Candidates may offer information about Richard I’s disagreements with other
                crusaders like Phillip of France and the Duke of Austria; his responsibility in
                the massacre of Acre; and his negotiations and agreements with Saladin.
                Candidates may also evaluate the actions taken by Richard I to finance
                his campaign, such as the sale of public offices and increasing taxes
                which caused a serious drain of resources.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

5.   (a)   What, according to Source G, was the impact of the Spanish conquest on the indigenous
           populations?                                                                          [3]

           •   The Spaniards seized land from the indigenous peoples.
           •   They forced the indigenous populations of all ages to work for them.
           •   The indigenous populations were not allowed to own houses or have possessions.
           •   The difficult working conditions contributed to the death of many indigenous people.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source H suggest about the impact of the conquest on the indigenous
           populations in Mexico?                                                                     [2]

           • The indigenous populations were exploited by the Spanish.
           • The Spanish treated the indigenous people brutally.
           • The Spanish killed indigenous people during the conquest.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source G
     for an historian studying the impact of the conquest on indigenous populations.                  [4]

     Value:
     • The source was written by an historian who was contemporary to the events studied.
     • It offers the perspective of a Spanish missionary during the conquest.
     • It provides detailed evidence of the exploitation of the indigenous peoples.
     • It is evidence that the Spanish government was aware of the negative impact of the
       conquest on the indigenous peoples.

     Limitations:
     • It was written with the purpose of denouncing the excesses committed during the conquest
       and to urge the Spanish government to respond to the atrocities described. As such, it may
       have exaggerated events.
     • The source was written in 1542, when events were still unfolding.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
     limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
     used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
     For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
     limitations.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and
     award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of
     what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor
     exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources state that the indigenous populations were exploited.
     • Both show the need to pass legislation regulating the living and working conditions of the
       indigenous peoples.
     • Both state the Spanish crown faced problems in finding a balance between the interests of
       encomenderos and the welfare of the indigenous populations.
     • Both sources attribute a leading role to Bartolomé de las Casas in attempting to regulate
       indigenous labour.

     Contrasts:
     • Whereas Source E claims Spain saw the encomiendas as leading to abuses, Source F states
       Spain saw them as necessary for prosperity.
     • Source E states encomenderos deserved large estates in America whereas Source F
       argues that there was concern these lords could challenge royal authority.

     Indicative content

     Source E             The source argues that the encomienda system turned the indigenous
                          populations almost into slaves. Although it highlights the benefits of the
                          New Laws (1542), it acknowledges that their implementation was
                          challenging.

     Source F             The source refers to the exploitation of the indigenous peoples, their loss
                          of land and the fact that they were made to pay tribute to Spain. It
                          argues that the encomienda became a necessary institution to
                          safeguard the welfare of the indigenous populations.

     Source G             The source discusses the negative impact of the conquest for the
                          indigenous populations by, for example, referring to the loss of housing
                          and possessions. Also, this source refers to the dangerous working
                          conditions and the resulting deaths.

Source H        The source focuses on the negative impact of the conquest by depicting
                oppression, death and brutality.

Own knowledge   Economic impact: Candidates may offer information on the Mita
                system (forced labour). They may refer to the exploitation of mines and
                its impact on the indigenous populations: displacements, poor living and
                working conditions, the rise of cities (for example, Zacatecas). They may
                discuss the impact of the deviation of water resources from indigenous
                fields or the introduction of cattle from Spain which occupied the land
                used for crop rotation. They may also refer to the Columbian exchange.
                Social impact: Candidates may offer details on the spread of diseases;
                the demographic crisis; the separation of families. They may also
                discuss the forced religious conversions; the growth of the mestizos
                population; the resistance to assimilation; the introduction of African
                slaves.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

9.   (a)   What, according to Source I, were Mussolini’s reasons for invading Abyssinia in
           October 1935?                                                                                [3]

           •   Italy did not receive the territories that it believed were promised to them in 1915.
           •   Italy had been patient with Abyssinia for 40 years and it was now time to take action.
           •   Mussolini believed that Britain and France would not take action against Italy.
           •   Mussolini considered the invasion of Abyssinia would lead only to a limited colonial
               conflict.

     (b)   What does Source J suggest about the Italian invasion of Abyssinia?                          [2]

           • The Italian forces used advanced weapons such as poison gas
             and aircraft.
           • The invasion was brutal and caused death and devastation.
           • It implies that Mussolini believed the Abyssinians were uncivilized, compared to the
             Italians.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source I for
      an historian studying Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia in 1935.                                       [4]

      Value:
      • The speech was given by Mussolini, leader of Italy, as the invasion of Abyssinia was launched.
      • The source indicates how Mussolini sought to justify the invasion of Abyssinia to the public.
      • The source gives specific details on the anticipated international reaction to the invasion
        of Abyssinia in 1935.

      Limitations:
      • The speech is a propaganda statement by Mussolini and therefore he may be exaggerating his
        argument.
      • It is only offering insight into the Italian government’s position on the invasion.
      • The source is from October 1935 when events were still unfolding.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
      used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
      For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
      limitations.

      what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor
      exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources see Mussolini’s invasion as being a reaction to the Italian defeat at
        Adowa in 1896.
      • Both sources identify Abyssinia as being one of the few territories left as a target for
        colonization in Africa by Mussolini.
      • Both sources claim that Britain and France were unlikely to intervene.
      • Both sources indicate that Mussolini was facing difficulties domestically and that a
        successful war was needed to help support his position as leader of Italy.

      Contrasts:
      • Source K identifies 1925 as the date by which Mussolini had decided on military preparations
        for war, whereas Source L states that the decision to go to war was made far later in 1932.
      • Source L is more explicit about Mussolini using the invasion as a response to the
        Depression, whereas Source K sees the invasion as being Mussolini’s need to maintain
        morale at home.

      responses.

      Indicative content

      Source I             It offers information on different factors influencing Mussolini’s decision.
                           For example, the fact that Italy did not make the territorial gains that it
                           believed were promised to them. Mussolini wanted revenge on
                           Abyssinia. Mussolini believed that Britain and France were unlikely to
                           intervene in any conflict with Abyssinia.

      Source J             Abyssinia was completely unprepared for war in 1935 and Italy, with its
                           technological advantage, would achieve an easy victory. Mussolini
                           believed Abyssinia was uncivilized.

      Source K             Mussolini wanted to create an African empire by invading Abyssinia,
                           eradicating the memory of the defeat of Adowa. Mussolini’s domestic
                           policies were failing and he needed to maintain morale at home by a
                           successful overseas war against weak opponents. Mussolini also saw
                           little danger of interference from Britain and France in 1935 who he
                           considered as allies.

Source L        Mussolini thought that Fascism had to show that it had an effective
                foreign policy and the invasion of Abyssinia was a perfect way of
                demonstrating it. Italy was still suffering economically from the
                Depression and a successful colonial conquest, which also reversed the
                humiliation of Adowa, was the perfect solution to criticism at home.

Own knowledge   Candidates may offer further detail on the relationship between Italy,
                Britain and France. For example, candidates may discuss the Franco-
                Italian Pact, the Stresa Front, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and
                their impact.
                Candidates may argue that the attitudes of Britain and France towards Italy
                indicated to Mussolini that the League would also be ineffectual in taking any
                unified action against the invasion. Its policy of collective security had been
                weakened by the Manchurian Incident in the 1930s.
                Candidates may also include some specific details concerning the
                failures of Italian social and economic domestic policies in the 1930s and
                Mussolini’s attempt to achieve autarky as factors behind the invasion.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

13.   (a)   What, according to Source M, were the reasons for the establishment of the
            Bantustan system?                                                                       [3]

      Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


      (b)   What does Source N suggest about the distribution of the Bantustans?                    [2]

            • The Bantustans comprised only a small proportion of South Africa’s total land area.
            • The Bantustans were fragmented.
            • The Bantustans were predominantly in the northern and eastern parts of
              South Africa.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source P
      for an historian studying the Bantustan system.                                                  [4]

      Value:
      • It is written by a specialist in South African history.
      • The publication date offers the benefit of hindsight.
      • The source provides an insight into the nature and injustice of the Bantustan system.
      • The source suggests that there was concern about the international perception of
        the system.

      Limitations:
      • The author’s intent is to provide a broad overview of South African history. Therefore, his
        account may lack sufficient depth when considering the Bantustans.
      • The source offers insight only on the establishment of the Bantustans and lacks
        information about the consequences of the implementation of the system.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
      used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
      For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
      limitations.

      what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor
      exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources state that the Bantustans were intended to serve the interests of the
        white population.
      • Both sources indicate that the Bantustans comprised only around 13% of South Africa’s
        land area.

      Contrasts:
      • Source P states that Verwoerd claimed Africans enjoyed full political rights whereas Source O
        claims there was no self-government for the Africans.
      • The tone in Source O is highly critical, with its central purpose being to demonstrate
        the injustice of the Bantustan system, whereas Source P provides a more detached
        historical account.
      • Whereas Source P mainly considers the political aspects of the Bantustan system,
        Source O largely focuses on its economic and social factors.
      • Source O focuses entirely upon the domestic impact of the Bantustan policy whereas
        Source P also considers the international perception of the system.

      responses.

      Indicative content

      Source M             The aims of the South African government were to respond to a situation
                           of international isolation, to achieve internal security and to respond to
                           economic concerns. Also, the government wanted to separate black
                           Africans from “white” South Africa.

      Source N             The map shows how most of South Africa’s land area was reserved for
                           the white population. However, this would strengthen black Africans’
                           opposition to the government.
                                       – 22 –               N20/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source O        This source’s demonstration of the injustice of the Bantustan system and
                its condemnation of the government suggests that the government
                would face a worsening security problem.

Source P        The source’s reference to the “best farming land and mineral wealth”
                being guaranteed for the white population could strengthen the
                government’s political position. However, the granting of only a small
                proportion of land to black Africans would be likely to increase black
                opposition to the government.

Own knowledge   Candidates may provide evidence of the black majority’s increasing
                hostility to the government and the security threat that this posed for the
                authorities. They may provide further details regarding the shooting of
                peaceful demonstrators in Sharpeville or make reference to the Langa
                March (1960). This in turn led to the leaders of both the African National
                Congress (ANC) and the Pan-African Congress (PAC) to decide to
                switch from peaceful protest to violence.
                The ANC’s “Spear of the People” began a campaign of sabotage, and the
                PAC also formed a terrorist group. Candidates may further discuss the
                international impact of Sharpeville and Langa which led to increased pressure
                on the South African government to end apartheid.
                Candidates may argue that white general election results showed a
                significant increase in support for the government between 1948 and
                1961. Candidates may argue that South Africa’s increasing ability to
                withstand international pressure was due to the Cold War and to South
                Africa’s economic strength, rather than the Bantustan system.

candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

17.   (a)   What, according to Source Q, were the aims of the Kosovo Liberation Army?                  [3]

            •   To gain the support of all Albanians for the armed struggle.
            •   To get funding for the movement.
            •   To liberate the territory from the occupiers.
            •   To call on the international community to commit to a fair solution to the conflict.

      responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.
      Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


      (b)   What does Source T suggest about Slobodan Milosevic’s actions in Kosovo?                   [2]

            • Milosevic had perpetrated violence and killing in Kosovo.
            • There had been an attempt to ethnically cleanse Kosovo.
            • Slobodan Milosevic was responsible for these actions and had become known as
              the butcher of Kosovo.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source Q
      for an historian studying the conflict in Kosovo.                                                [4]

      Value:
      • The source is a statement by the KLA, a key actor in the conflict, at a time when tension was
        increasing in Kosovo.
      • It reveals the aims publicly set down by the KLA and provides justifications for its actions.
      • It indicates how the KLA rallied support by highlighting issues which led to conflict in
        Kosovo and how it criticized the inaction of the international community.

      Limitations:
      • The source is from 1997, when events were still unfolding.
      • The aim is to rally support for the KLA, therefore it may exaggerate Serbian actions in Kosovo.
      • The language is emotive and it does not offer a balanced account regarding the situation
        in Kosovo at the time.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the question. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be
      used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations.
      For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the
      limitations.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources state that the failed attempt to arrest Adem Jashari contributed to the conflict.
      • Both state that the brutal attack on the Jashari clan in March was a turning point in the conflict,
        strengthening support for the KLA.
      • Both state that Adem Jashari was or became a symbol of resistance for Kosovan Albanians.
      • Both state that weapons came from Albania into Kosovo, contributing to increased
        violence.

      Contrasts:
      • Source R highlights the role of the United States in the conflict, whereas Source S focuses on
        the regional factors.
      • Source R suggests the KLA were gaining in strength, whereas Source S suggests the
        Serbian army was far superior.

      responses.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             The KLA called for funding and support from Albanians to enable them
                           to respond with greater force to liberate Kosovo, which contributed to the
                           conflict. However, the KLA claim to be responding to Serb violence.

      Source R             The source identifies a number of factors that escalated the conflict such
                           as the growing strength of the KLA but also the attack on the Jashari
                           clan by Serbian police and military. The source also suggests that the
                           United States envoy may have contributed to the conflict.

      Source S             The source outlines Serbian responsibility for the escalation of conflict
                           as the result of its campaign of suppression. It refers to the brutal attack
                           on the Jashari clan. However, the escalation was also due to the
                           collapse of the Albanian government in 1997, and the subsequent
                           access to arms for the KLA.

Source T        Slobodan Milosevic was responsible for the escalation and was called
                the ‘butcher of Kosovo’. The source also implies that Serbian forces had
                attempted to ‘ethnically cleanse’ Kosovo.

Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that the actions of Kosovar Albanians escalated
                the conflict. The KLA, set up in 1996, began a series of attacks on Serb
                police and army units which continued throughout 1997. The KLA made
                public appearances at the funerals of Kosovar Albanians and these
                became the focus for mass protests. The KLA increased armed attacks
                on Serb forces in early 1998. By the spring of 1998 attacks on Serb
                police were launched from Albania.
                Candidates may provide further detail on the role of the Serbian
