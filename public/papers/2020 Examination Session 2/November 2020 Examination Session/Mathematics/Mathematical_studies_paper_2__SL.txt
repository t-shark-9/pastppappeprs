Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Solutions found from a graphic
display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a
solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

       Don took part in a project investigating wind speed, x km h-1 , and the time, y minutes, to fully
       charge a solar powered robot.

       The investigation was carried out six times. The results are recorded in the table.

     Wind Speed, x , (km h-1 )         6            10          16        24           28           30

       (a)   On graph paper, draw a scatter diagram to show the results of Don’s investigation.
             Use a scale of 1 cm to represent 2 units on the x-axis, and 1 cm to represent 5 units
             on the y-axis.[4]

       (b)   Calculate

             (i)     x , the mean wind speed;

             (ii)    y , the mean time to fully charge the robot.                                          [2]

       M is the point with coordinates ( x , y ).

       (c)   Plot and label the point M on your scatter diagram.                                           [2]

       (d)   (i)	Calculate r , Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient.

             (ii)    Describe the correlation between the wind speed and the time to fully charge
                     the robot.                                                                            [4]

       (e)   (i)	Write down the equation of the regression line y on x , in the form y = mx + c .

             (ii)    Draw this regression line on your scatter diagram.

             (iii)   Hence or otherwise estimate the charging time when the wind speed is 27 km h-1.[6]

       Don concluded from his investigation: “There is no causation between wind speed and the
       time to fully charge the robot”.

       (f)   In the context of the question, briefly explain the meaning of “no causation”.                [1]

     (d)     Find the value of x .                                                                      [2]

     Emlyn will play in two basketball games today.

     (e)     Find the probability he plays between 13 minutes and 18 minutes in one game and
             more than 20 minutes in the other game.                                                    [3]

     Emlyn and his teammate Johan each practise shooting the basketball multiple times from
     a point X . A record of their performance over the weekend is shown in the table below.

                                      Emlyn                                    Johan

       Saturday       42 successful shots from 70 attempts      16 successful shots from 30 attempts
           Sunday     27 successful shots from 32 attempts      51 successful shots from 68 attempts

     On Monday, Emlyn and Johan will practise and each will shoot 200 times from point X .

     (f)     Find the expected number of successful shots Emlyn will make on Monday, based on
             the results from Saturday and Sunday.                                                      [2]

     Emlyn claims the results from Saturday and Sunday show that his expected number of
     successful shots will be more than Johan’s.

     (g)     Determine if Emlyn’s claim is correct. Justify your reasoning.                             [2]
