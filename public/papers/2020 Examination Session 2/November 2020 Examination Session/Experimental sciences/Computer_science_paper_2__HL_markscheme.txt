Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions for one of the four options. Total 65 marks.
Maximum total = 65 marks.

General

• A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is
  intentional. Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

• When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider
  the following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
  semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                     explanation etc.

Option A —Databases

1.   (a)    Award [2 max].

                          has a                              has

                                           Individual




            Accept either diagram. License, Individual, and Vehicle correctly positioned
            Award [1] for 1 to 1.
            Award [1] for 1 to m.

     (b)    Award [3 max].
            The order that a date is written varies by country, eg dd/mm/yyyy in UK, mm/dd/yyyy in US;
            Some dates, such as 01 June 2018 (01/06/2018) could be confused with 06 January 2018
            (06/01/2018);
            leading to the incorrect information being stored and consequent decisions, eg license
            expired at the wrong time due to incorrect age;

            The Date/String datatype will make analysing slower;
            integers can be analysed more quickly than Date/String datatypes;
            because functions will be used to split/extract the data;

            The Date datatype will make validating data more difficult.
            because it is easier to validate separate integer fields;
            rather than one entire data that will need to be split by functions;
                                              –5–                N20/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Award [6 max].

      Normalisation
      Medical information is only stored if the person has a medical condition / some people will
      have no medical information stored / some people may have more than one medical
      conditions;
      this requires an additional table / normalisation requires a separate table / one to many
      relationship;
      leaving in the person table will increase storage capacity / empty fields take up space;

      Privacy
      All employees will need access to the person table and that would include sensitive medical
      information;
      Protects people’s privacy / data needs to comply with the Data Protection Act / private
      medical data seen by non-authorised personnel may cause harm to the licence applicant /
      potentially result in legal action;
      having confidential data in a separate table allows that table to be only available to people
      with a certain permission level;

      Updates
      Person table is also likely to be less permanent and need updating more often;
      medical information rarely gets updated so is more permanent;
      the person table may be useful in other applications, as it offers a way of identifying
      citizens/the medical data is not likely to be used by other applications;

      Mark as [3] + [3]

(d)   Award [4 max].
      May lead to update/deletion anomalies;
      Address changes may result in duplicate addresses;
      so letters / fines may go to the wrong address;
      Storing data multiple times wastes storage space;
      and may slow down data retrieval / data entry;

(e)   Award [4 max].
      Accept any suitable example

      Police access
      It is a legal requirement for the VDLA to give access to the police;
      eg a speeding vehicle / an accident / linked to a police investigation;
      so the police will need to look up the details of the person that owns the car;
      facial scanning software may be cross-referenced with the car owner’s driving license photo;
      so that police have a way to check the identity of the person driving the car;

      Insurance company access
      A person taking out car insurance signs a consent form to give VDLA access to their records;
      this would allow the insurance company to build up a profile eg, check for driving offences,
      see how long that person had owned a car;
      thus, a quote could be created quickly / minimal effort;
      provides proof of driver eligibility (ie, not serving a driving ban);

      Medical access
      Doctors may require access to an accident victim’s records;
      To check blood type etc;

2.   (a)    Award [1 max].
            A logical unit of work that is executed in full or not at all;
            A transaction is a single logical operation that comprises of a sequence of database
            operations;
            A transation satisfies the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties;

      (b)   Award [2 max].
            The database would store details of concerts, tickets sold, customers;
            An information system would access the database to present data it in a way that aids
            informs managers / aids decision making (eg charts of ticket sales);

            Accept any other reasonable example.

      (c)   Award [3 max].
            Durability ensures that transactions are saved permanently and do not accidentally
            disappear or get erased;
            Billetmania does not need to worry the transaction being lost even in the event of power loss,
            crashes, or errors;
            A seat in a theatre is guaranteed even if the database crashes;

      (d)   Award [4 max].
            Concurrency allows multiple users try to book tickets at the same time / complete a
            transaction at the same time;
            Concurrency prevents access by more than one user to the same row/record;
            Concurrency uses row locking;
            Select seats are locked for a short period of time to ensure that they aren’t double
            booked/overwritten;

4.   (a)    Award [2 max].
            Data warehouse involves historical processing (eg trends) of information / timestamped
            whereas databases involves the day-to-day processing / data from one region;
            OLAP systems in a data warehouse are used by analysists and senior police officers
            whereas OLAP systems in a database are used by clerks and police officers;
            Data warehouse focuses on information out whereas a database focuses on data in.
            Data warehouses stores considerably more data than a database / TBs compared to GBs
            of data / greater variety of data / data from a variety of sources;
            Data warehouses tend to be unnormalised. Databases are normalised;

            Data to be extracted would need to be identified;
            Data would need to be converted into a standardised format / ETL;
            Encryption of data would need to be setup / certification to approve uplinks;
            Imported data would need to be time-stamped;
            Fast internet connection at each of the database points;

      (d)   Award [5 max].
            Classification uses predictive methods whereas clustering uses descriptive methods;
            Typically in classification you have a set of predefined classes and want to know which class
            the object belongs whereas in clustering it tries to group a set of objects based on some
            relationship between them;
            Classification uses supervised learning and clustering uses unsupervised learning;
            Classification uses labelled samples and clustering uses unlabelled samples;
            An advantage of clustering over classification is that it is adaptable to changes and helps
            single out useful features that distinguish different groups/makes no assumptions about the
            number and form of any groups that emerge;
            Both cluster analysis and classification typically output results in the form of diagrammatic
            representation of the objects being analysed (eg series of plots);
            The results of both methods can be used to make predictions and to decide on the
            importance of different data variables in making the predictions;
            Classification requires prior knowledge but cluster analysis does not;

(e)   Award [5 max].
      Link analysis is used to highlight the relationships between databases/objects, which in this
      context might be different crimes;
      It begins by deciding what constitutes a link (association) between two objects;
      For example, the police department might link individuals based on the number of times their
      name appears in the same crime investigation, or link crimes based on their location, type,
      nature of the victim;
      Link analysis discovers new relations / new patterns of interest / checks the similarities in the
      data sets / finds anomalies where know patterns are violated;
      Similarities between crimes may be identified even if they initially appear unrelated (eg
      victims of a particular crime type were all born on the same day);
      Studying the links can reveal patterns, including groups and outliers. So the police
      department might be able to identify a “gang” of associates (groups) or a crime that was
      thought to be related but wasn’t (outlier);
      Link analysis is based on a branch of mathematics called graph theory, which represents
      relationships between different objects as edges in a graph;

            Open standards provide a publicly available specification for a specified task;
            This is an agreed set of parameters that enable interoperability and/or compatibility to occur;

            Using Open standards means that you are not subject to a governing body with its own
            agenda/self-interest;
            Thus, you can be confident that you won’t be subject to fees/bias;

            Open standards promote interoperability;
            This enables the various devices to communicate with each other;

            Open standards advocates also argue that openness encourages better and more secure
            systems;
            this is because more people are able to analyse the standards and resulting software and

            World Wide Web has enabled citizens to communicate easily and for ‘ordinary’ citizens to
            express their opinions;
            Therefore, the ability to publish is not confined to certain ‘privileged’ groups such as
            broadcasters and journalists;
            The World Wide Web has to a large degree given access to common resources to all citizens
            globally who have access to the Internet;
            However, it can be argued that the evolution of the World Wide Web has led to a greater
            centralization of power, for example the digital oligarchs (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple,
            Facebook);
            This centralization has led to a reduction in democracy as the digital oligarchs have an
            increasing stranglehold over the lives of their ‘digital subjects’ through the aggregation,
            analysis and monetarization of their data;
            There are still issues with a lack of digital democracy, for example, many citizens may not
            have access to the World Wide Web, either through income, geography or necessary skills;

            And in combination with the increasing speed of web-pages loading;
            Means that despite the significant increase in the number of web-pages, despite there being
            an increase in the number of hops required to navigate from one web-page, there may be no

            The semantic web is based on data and enables computer systems to understand the
            meaning of information and its relation to other pieces of information;
            this increased usability is dependent on the ability of the different computers to process the
            intended meaning of content better;
            however, giving information more expressive power may come at an expense of usability;
            for example, a language such as RDF can be highly expressive power, but requires the user
            to specify relations of information to other information;
            in some cases, it may be beneficial to create shared databases (i.e. increase the usability);
            but, there may be other cases where the increased expressivity leads to a decrease in
            usability;

      This ability to harness the benefits of collective intelligence have been made possible by the
      development of the internet;
      Collective intelligence can be used for a variety of purposes, for example linked to social
      media (Facebook and Twitter), gaming sites (Online Multi-player games), Scientific research
      (Large hadron Collider and Wikipedia;
      Collective intelligence benefits from the open sharing of resources and may allow for a more
      rapid evolution of ideas than ‘traditional’ methods;
      Collective intelligence may not have a central authority, so the user created information may
      be considered to be factual when it is not;
      Collective intelligence may lead to a disruption in the way that knowledge is stored or
      classified, ie the development of folksonomies in place of ontologies;
      The lack of a formal organizational structure may lead to the acquisition of the collective
      intelligence being potentially piecemeal or haphazard;
      There may be no owner of this additional knowledge, so it may not be stored or maintained in
      the most efficient manner;

            at the class level;
            Static means that less memory is taken up;
            as only 1 memory allocation it created for all instances rather than 1 per instance;

      Inheritance is when the behaviour of a class is transferred to another class;
      whereas aggregation is when a class is contained inside another and used;

      Aggregation is useful for modelling a real life situation of containment aka. “has a” (eg
      contents of a box);
      whereas Inheritance is useful for modelling real life situation that one entity is a particular
      (more specific) type of another entity, aka. “is a”;

      While both can achieve the same result, Aggregation (composition) can lead to more robust
      and safer code;
      whereas inheritance is a more flexible solution but prone to errors due to the behaviour of
      subclasses being changed;

      Inheritance allows for code reuse / lowers maintenance cost;
      whereas aggregation does neither of the above;

      Can have more than 1 aggregation;
      but only 1 superclass (in Java);

      Inheritance allows for code reuse as in the creation of sub-classes;
      whereas with aggregation each class must be written out in full;

      Cars and Motorbikes are also Vehicles as they extend the Vehicle class / Vehicle is the
      superclass and Car/Motorbike are subclasses;
      The subclasses can be cast as/considered to be/referred to as Vehicle which is its
      superclass;
      As Cars and Motorbikes inherit from Vehicles they are also Vehicles and can therefore be
      stored in an array of type Vehicle;
      Arrays must be declared as 1 type, and the state and behaviour of Vehicle is what both Car
      and Motorbike have in common. Therefore they can be referenced as Vehicles and stored in
      an array of Vehicles, even though they are subclasses;

            The array would need to be searched using a linear search which is inefficient O(n) whereas
            a binary search is much more efficient O(log n);
            A linear search for a car in this parking area could require a maximum of 200 comparisons
            (ie. it would look at the first row of every column) whereas a binary search would only require
            8 (ie log 200 base 2);
            A linear search for a motorbike in this parking area would require a maximum of 400
            comparisons (ie. it would need to look at both rows of every column) whereas a binary
            search would only require 7 (log 100 base 2);
            In a binary search, each comparison would eliminate half of the remaining possible matches,
            whereas in a linear search it only eliminates 1;
            A binary search has the registration plate as its key and therefore it doesn’t require
            accessing the field of the vehicle object for each comparison, whereas in a linear search,
            each comparison would be slower because it would require getting the vehicle object’s
            registration field using an accessor method;
            A binary search is always faster than a linear search on a large data set. As the police may
            be searching for many cars and in many parking areas, their searches will be on large set of

(b)   Award [4 max].
      Award [1] for an initial valid comparison and [1] for a valid expansion.

      Memory
      Linked lists can deal with memory issues more efficiently than arrays;
      Arrays are static so will have a maximum size and cannot grow beyond that;
      Memory will be allocated for maximum size at instantiation so while it is not full memory is
      wasted Links are dynamic and can add/remove memory as required- no memory is wasted;

      Implementation
      No particular advantage is gained by the use of either structure;
      As additions and removals (push and pop) work on one end of the stack, navigation speed
      (ie O1) is not very helpful; Linked lists can adjust the pointer at the end of the list (can use a
      tail pointer) so slow navigation is not an issue;

      Errors
      The use of arrays is more likely to lead to run-time errors;
      As arrays can reach their maximum limit whilst linked lists are only limited in size by the
      specifications of the CPU;
                                                                                                       [4]
